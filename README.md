# Book - Analysis

The BBC published an article claiming "Mr Greedy 'almost as hard to read' as Steinbeck classics" - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47426551

The article says the research scanned "every page for sentence length, average word length and word difficulty level"

We decided to do some analysis using NLP, RegEx & Readability metrics to see if this is true.
