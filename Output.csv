0,OF MICE AND MEN ,"Slim ain’t. Least I don’t think Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le’s go.” George said, “I’m stayin’ right here. I don’t want to get mixed up in nothing. Lennie and me got to make a stake.” Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and pushed the bag under his bunk. “I guess I’ll go out and look her over,” he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, watched George cautiously. When Whit and Carlson were gone and the  door closed after them, George turned to Lennie. “What you got on your mind?” “I ain’t done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain’t good for them; so I come right in. I been good, George.” “I coulda told you that,” said George. “Well, I wasn’t hurtin’ ’em none. I jus’ had mine in my lap pettin’ it.” George asked, “Did you see Slim out in the bam?” “Sure I did. He tol’ me I better not pet that pup no more.” “Did you see that girl?” “You mean Curley’s girl?” “Yeah. Did she come in the bam?” “No. Anyways I never seen her.” “You never seen Slim talkin’ to her?” “Uh-uh. She ain’t been in the bam.” “O.K.,” said George. “I guess them guys ain’t gonna see no fight. If there’s any fightin’, Lennie, you keep out of it.” “I don’t want no fights,” said Lennie. He got up from his bunk and sat down at the table, across from George. Almost automatically George shuffled the cards and laid out his solitaire hand. He used a deliberate, thoughtful, slowness. Lennie reached for a face card and studied it, then turned it upside down and studied it. “Both ends the same,” he said. “George, why is it both end’s the same?” “I don’t know,” said George. “That’s jus’ the way they make ’em. What was Slim doin’ in the bam when you seen him?” “Slim?” “Sure. You seen him in the bam, an’ he tol’ you not to pet the pups so much.” “Oh, yeah. He had a can a’ tar an’ a paint brash. I don’t know what for.” “You sure that girl didn’t come in like she come in here today?” “No. She never come.” George sighed. “You give me a good whore  house every time,” he said. “A guy can go in an’ get drunk and get ever’thing outa his system all at once, an’ no messes. And he knows how much it’s gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger of the hoosegow.” Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little to keep up. George continued, “You remember Andy Cushman, Lennie? Went to grammar school?” “The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?” Lennie asked. “Yeah. That’s the one. You can remember anything if there’s anything to eat in it.” George looked carefully at the solitaire hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three and four of diamonds on it. “Andy’s in San Quentin right now on account of a tart,” said George. Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. “George?” “Huh?” “George, how long’s it gonna be till we get  that little place an’ live on the fatta the lan— an’ rabbits?” “I don’ know,” said George. “We gotta get a big stake together. I know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain’t givin’ it away.” Old Candy turned slowly over. His eyes were wide open. He watched George carefully. Lennie said, “Tell about that place, George.” “I jus’ tol’ you, jus’ las’ night.” “Go on— tell again, George.” “Well, it’s ten acres,” said George. “Got a little win’mill. Got a little shack on it, an’ a chicken run. Got a kitchen, orchard, cherries, apples, peaches, ’cots, nuts, got a few berries. They’s a place for alfalfa and plenty water to flood it. They’s a pig pen — ” “An’ rabbits, George.” “No place for rabbits now, but I could easy build a few hutches and you could feed alfalfa to the rabbits.” “Damn right, I could,” said Lennie. “You God damn right I could.” ioo George’s hands stopped working with the cards. His voice was growing warmer. “An’ we could have a few pigs. I could build a smoke house like the one gran’pa had, an’ when we kill a pig we can smoke the bacon and the hams, and make sausage an’ all like that. An’ when the salmon run up river we could catch a hundred of ’em an’ salt ’em down or smoke ’em. We could have them for breakfast. They ain’t nothing so nice as smoked salmon. When the fruit come in we could can it— and tomatoes, they’re easy to can. Ever’ Sunday we’d kill a chicken or a rabbit. Maybe we’d have a cow or a goat, and the cream is so God damn thick you got to cut it with a knife and take it out with a spoon.” Lennie watched him with wide eyes, and old Candy watched him too. Lennie said softly, “We could live offa the fatta the lan’.” “Sure,” said George. “All kin’s a vegetables in the garden, and if we want a little whisky we can sell a few eggs or something, or some milk. We’d jus’ live there. We’d belong there. I I There wouldn’t be no more runnin’ round the country and gettin’ fed by a Jap cook. No, sir, we’d have our own place where we belonged and not sleep in no bunk house.” “Tell about the house, George,” Lennie begged. “Sure, we’d have a little house an’ a room to ourself. Little fat iron stove, an’ in the winter we’d keep a fire goin’ in it. It ain’t enough land so we’d have to work too hard. Maybe six, seven hours a day. We wouldn’t have to buck no barley eleven hours a day. An’ when we put in a crop, why, we’d be there to take the crop up. We’d know what come of our planting.” “An’ rabbits,” Lennie said eagerly. “An’ I’d take care of ’em. Tell how I’d do that, George.” “Sure, you’d go out in the alfalfa patch an’ you’d have a sack. You’d fill up the sack and bring it in an’ put it in the rabbit cages.” “They’d nibble an’ they’d nibble,” said Lennie, “the way they do. I seen ’em.” “Ever’ six weeks or so,” George continued, “them does would throw a litter so we’d have plenty rabbits to eat an’ to sell. An’ we’d keep a few pigeons to go flyin’ around the win’mill like they done when I was a kid.” He looked rapdy at the wall over Lennie’s head. “An’ it’d be our own, an’ nobody could can us. If we don’t like a guy we can say, ‘Get the hell out/ and by God he’s got to do it. An’ if a fren’ come along, why we’d have an extra bunk, an’ we’d say, ‘Why don’t you spen’ the night?’ an’ by God he would. We’d have a setter dog and a couple stripe cats, but you gotta watch out them cats don’t get the little rabbits.” Lennie breathed hard. “You jus’ let ’em try to get the rabbits. I’ll break their God damn necks. I’ll , I’ll smash ’em with a stick.” He subsided, grumbling to himself, threatening the future cats which might dare to disturb the future rabbits. George sat entranced with his own picture. When Candy spoke they both jumped as i° though they had been caught doing some thing reprehensible. Candy said, “You know where’s a place like that?” George was on guard immediately. “S’pose I do,” he said. “What’s that to you?” “You don’t need to tell me where it’s at. Might be any place.” “Sure,” said George. “That’s right. You couldn’t find it in a hundred years.” Candy went on excitedly, “How much they want for a place like that?” George watched him suspiciously. “Well-I could get it for six hundred bucks. The oI’ people that owns it is flat bust an’ the ol’ lady needs an operation. Say— what’s it to you? You got nothing to do with us.” Candy said, “I ain’t much good with on’y one hand. I lost my hand right here on this ranch. Thats why they give me a job swampin’. An’ they give me two hunderd an’ fifty dollars cause I los’ my hand. An’ I got fifty more saved up right in the bank, right now. Tha’s three  hunderd, and I got fifty more cornin’ the end a the month. Tell yon what — ” He leaned forward eagerly. “S’pose I went in with you guys. Tha’s three hunderd an’ fifty bucks I’d put in. I ain’t much good, but I could cook and tend the chickens and hoe the garden some. How’d that be?” George half-closed his eyes. “I gotta think about that. We was always gonna do it by ourselves.” Candy interrupted him, “I’d make a will an’ leave my share to you guys in case I kick off, ’cause I ain’t got no relatives nor nothing. You guys got any money? Maybe we could do her right now?” George spat on the floor disgustedly. “We got ten bucks between us.” Then he said thoughtfully, “Look, if me an’ Lennie work a month an’ don’t spen’ nothing, we’ll have a hunderd bucks. That’d be four fifty. I bet we could swing her for that. Then you an’ Lennie could go get her started an’ I’d get a job an’ make up i° the res’, an’ you could sell eggs an’ stuff like that.” They fell into a silence. They looked at one another, amazed. This thing they had never really believed in was coming true. George said reverently, “Jesus Christ! I bet we could swing her.” His eyes were full of wonder. “I bet we could swing her,” he repeated softly. Candy sat on the edge of his bunk. He scratched the stump of his wrist nervously. “I got hurt four year ago,” he said. “They’ll can me purty soon. Jus’ as soon as I can’t swamp out no bunk houses they’ll put me on the county. Maybe if I give you guys my money, you’ll let me hoe in the garden even after I ain’t no good at it. An   wash dishes an’ little chicken stuff like that. But I’ll be on our own place, an’ I’ll be let to work on our own place.” He said miserably, You seen what they done to my dog tonight? They says he wasn’t no good to himself nor nobody else. When they can me here I wisht somebody’d shoot me. But they won’t do noth ing like that. I won’t have no place to go, an’ I can’t get no more jobs. I’ll have thirty dollars more cornin’, time you guys is ready to quit.” George stood up. “We’ll do her,” he said. “We’ll fix up that little old place an’ we’ll go live there.” He sat down again. They all sat still, all bemused by the beauty of the thing, each mind was popped into the future when this lovely thing should come about. George said wonderingly, “S’pose they was a carnival or a circus come to town, or a ball game, or any damn thing.” Old Candy nodded in appreciation of the idea. “We’d just go to her,” George said. “We wouldn’t ask nobody if we could. Jus’ say, We’ll go to her,’ an’ we would. Jus’ milk the cow and sling some grain to the chickens an’ go to her.” “An’ put some grass to the rabbits,” Lennie broke in. “I wouldn’t never forget to feed them. When we gon’ta do it, George?” “In one month. Right squack in one month. Know what I’m gon’ta do? I’m gon’ta write to  them old people that owns the place that we’ll take it. An’ Candy’ll send a hunderd dollars to bind her.” “Sure will,” said Candy. “They got a good stove there?” “Sure, got a nice stove, burns coal or wood.” “I’m gonna take my pup,” said Lennie. “I bet by Christ he likes it there, by Jesus.” Voices were approaching from outside. George said quickly, “Don’t tell nobody about it. Jus’ us three an’ nobody else. They li’ble to can us so we can’t make no stake. Jus’ go on like we was gonna buck barley the rest of our lives, then all of a sudden some day we’ll go get our pay an’ scram outa here.” Lennie and Candy nodded, and they were grinning with delight. “Don’t tell nobody,” Lennie said to himself. Candy said, “George.” “Huh?” “I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn’t ought to of let no stranger shoot my dog.”  The door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley and Carlson and Whit. Slim’s hands were black with tar and he was scowling. Curley hung close to his elbow. Curley said, “Well, I didn’t mean nothing. Slim. I just ast you.” Slim said, “Well, you been askin’ me too often. I’m gettin’ God damn sick of it. If you can’t look after your own God damn wife, what you expect me to do about it? You lay offa me.” “I’m jus’ tryin’ to tell you I didn’t mean nothing,” said Curley. “I jus’ thought you might of saw her.” “Why’n’t you tell her to stay the hell home where she belongs?” said Carlson. “You let her hang around bunk houses and pretty soon you’re gonna have som’pin on your hands and you won’t be able to do nothing about it.” Curley whirled on Carlson. “You keep outta this les’ you wanta step outside.” Carlson laughed. “You God damn punk,” he  said. “You tried to throw a scare into S lim, an’ you couldn’t make it stick. Slim throwed a scare inta you. You’re yella as a frog belly. I don’t care if you’re the best welter in the country. You come for me, an’ I’ll kick your God damn head off.” Candy joined the attack with joy. “Glove fulla vaseline,” he said disgustedly. Curley glared at him. His eyes slipped on past and lighted on Lennie; and Lennie was still smiling with delight at the memory of the ranch. Curley stepped over to Lennie like a terrier. ‘‘What the hell you laughin’ at?” Lennie looked blankly at him . “Huh?” Then Curley’s rage exploded. “Come on, ya big bastard. Get up on your feet. No big son-ofa-bitch is gonna laugh at me. I’ll show ya who’s yella.” Lennie looked helplessly at George, and then he got up and tried to retreat. Curley was balanced and poised. He slashed at Lennie with his left, and then smashed down his nose with a no right. Lennie gave a cry of terror. Blood welled from his nose. “George,” he cried. “Make ’urn let me alone, George.” He backed until he was against the wall, and Curley followed, slugging him in the face. Lennie’s hands remained at his sides; he was too frightened to defend himself. George was on his feet yelling, “Get him, Lennie. Don’t let him do it.” Lennie covered his face with his huge paws and bleated with terror. He cried, “Make ’um stop, George.” Then Curley attacked his stomach and cut off his wind. Slim jumped up. “The dirty little rat,” he cried, “I’ll get ’um myself.” George put out his hand and grabbed Slim. “Wait a minute,” he shouted. He cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, “Get ’im, Lennie!” Lennie took his hands away from his face and looked about for George, and Curley slashed at his eyes. The big face was covered with blood. George yelled again, “I said get him .” Curley’s fist was swinging when Lennie reached for it. The next minute Curley was flopping like a fish on a line, and his closed fist was lost in Lennie’s big hand. George ran down the room. “Leggo of him, Lennie. Let go.” But Lennie watched in terror the flopping little man whom he held. Blood ran down Lennie’s face, one of his eyes was cut and closed. George slapped him in the face again and again, and still Lennie held on to the closed fist. Curley was white and shrunken by now, and his struggling had become weak. He stood crying, his fist lost in Lennie’s paw. George shouted over and over, “Leggo his hand, Lennie. Leggo. Slim, come help me while the guy got any hand left.” Suddenly Lennie let go his hold. He crouched cowering against the wall. “You tol’ me to, George,” he said miserably. Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up and re garded Lennie with horror. “We got to get him in to a doctor,” he said. “Looks to me like ever’ bone in his han’ is bust.” “I didn’t wanta,” Lennie cried. “I didn’t wanta hurt him.” Slim said, “Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We’ll take ’um into Soledad an’ get ’um fixed up.” Carlson hurried out. Slim turned to the whimpering Lennie. “It ain’t your fault,” he said. “This punk sure had it cornin’ to him. But— Jesus! He ain’t hardly got no han’ left.” Slim hurried out, and in a moment returned with a tin cup of water. Fie held it to Curley’s lips. George said, “Slim, will we get canned now? We need the stake. Will Curley’s old man can us now?” Slim smiled wryly. He knelt down beside Curley. “You got your senses in hand enough to listen?” he asked. Curley nodded. “Well, then listen,” Slim went on. “I think you got your han’ caught in a machine. If you don’t H tell nobody what happened, we ain’t going to. But you jus’ tell an’ try to get this guy canned and we’ll tell ever’body, an’ then will you get the laugh.” “I won’t tell,” said Curley. He avoided looking at Lennie. Buggy wheels sounded outside. Slim helped Curley up. “Come on now. Carlson’s gonna take you to a doctor.” He helped Curley out the door. The sound of wheels drew away. In a moment Slim came back into the bunk house. He looked at Lennie, still crouched fearfully against the wall. “Le’s see your hands,” he asked. Lennie stuck out his hands. “Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me,” Slim said. George broke in, “Lennie was jus’ scairt,” he explained. “He didn’t know what to do. I told you nobody ought never to fight him. No, I guess it was Candy I told.” Candy nodded solemnly. “That’s jus’ what you done,” he said. “Right this morning when   Curley first lit intil your fren\ you says, ‘He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what’s good for ’um.’ That’s jus’ what you says to me.” George turned to Lennie. “It ain’t your fault,” he said. “You don’t need to be scairt no more. You done jus’ what I tol’ you to. Maybe you better go in the wash room an’ clean up your face. You look like hell.” Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. “I didn’t want no trouble,” he said. He walked toward the door, but just before he came to it, he turned back. “George?” “What you want?” “I can still tend the rabbits, George?” “Sure. You ain’t done nothing wrong.” “I di’n’t mean no harm, George.” “Well, get the hell out and wash your face.” CROOKS, the negro stable buck, had his bunk in the harness room; a little shed that leaned off the wall of the bam. On one side of the little room there was a square four-paned window, and on the other, a narrow plank door leading into the barn. Crooks’ bunk was a long box filled with straw, on which his blankets were flung. On the wall by the window there were pegs on which hung broken harness in process of being mended;^ strips of new leather; and under the window itself a little bench for leather-working tools, curved knives and needles and balls of linen thread, and a small hand riveter. On pegs were also pieces of harness, a split collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out, a broken hame, and a trace chain with its leather ix covering split. Crooks had his apple box over his bunk, and in it a range of medicine bottles, both for himself and for the horses. There were cans of saddle soap and a drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the edge. And scattered about the floor were a number of personal possessions; for, being alone, Crooks could leave his things about, and being a stable buck and a cripple, he was more permanent than the other men, and he had accumulated more possessions than he could carry on his back. Crooks possessed several pairs of shoes, a pair of rubber boots, a big alarm clock and a singlebarreled shotgun. And he had books, too; a tattered dictionary and a mauled copy of the California civil code for . There were battered magazines and a few dirty books on a special shelf over his bunk. A pair of large gold-rimmed spectacles hung from a nail on the wall above his bed. This room was swept and fairly neat, for Crooks was a proud, aloof man. He kept his dis tance and demanded that other people keep theirs. His body was bent over to the left by his crooked spine, and his eyes lay deep in his head, and because of their depth seemed to glitter with intensity. His lean face was lined with deep black wrinkles, and he had thin, pain-tightened lips which were lighter than his face. It was Saturday night. Through the open door that led into the bam came the sound of moving horses, of feet stirring, of teeth champing on hay, of the rattle of halter chains. In the stable bucks room a small electric globe threw a meager yellow light. Crooks sat on his bunk. His shirt was out of his jeans in back. In one hand he held a bottle of liniment, and with the other he rubbed his spme. Now and then he poured a few drops of the liniment into his pink-palmed hand and reached up under his shirt to rub again. He flexed his muscles against his back and shivered. Noiselessly Lennie appeared in the open doorway and stood there looking in, his big shoulders  nearly filling the opening. For a moment Crooks did not see him, but on raising his eyes he stiffened and a scowl came on his face. His hand came out from under his shirt. Lennie smiled helplessly in an attempt to make friends. Crooks said sharply, “You got no right to come in my room. This here’s my room. Nobody got any right in here but me.” Lennie gulped and his smile grew more fawning. “I ain’t doing nothing,” he said. “Just come to look at my puppy. And I seen your light,” he explained. “Well, I got a right to have a light. You go on get outta my room. I ain’t wanted in the bunk house, and you ain’t wanted in my room.” “Why ain’t you wanted?” Lennie asked. “ ’Cause I’m black. They play cards in there, but I can’t play because I’m black. They say I stink. Well, I tell you, you all of you stink to me.” Lennie flapped his big hands helplessly. ” “Ever’body went into town,” he said. “Slim an’ George an’ ever’body. George says I gotta stay here an’ not get in no trouble. I seen your light.” “Well, what do you want?” “Nothing— I seen your light. I thought I could jus’ come in an’ set.” Crooks stared at Lennie, and he reached behind him and took down the spectacles and adjusted them over his pink ears and stared again. “I don’t know what you’re doin’ in the bam anyway,” he complained. “You ain’t no skinner. They’s no call for a bucker to come into the barn at all. You ain’t no skinner. You ain’t got nothing to do with the horses.” “The pup,” Lennie repeated. “I come to see my pup.” “Well, go see your pup, then. Don’t come in a place where you’re not wanted.” Lennie lost his smile. He advanced a step into the room, then remembered and backed to the  door again. “I looked at ’em a little. Slim says I ain’t to pet ’em very much.” Crooks said, “Well, you been takin’ ’em out of the nest all the time. I wonder the old lady don’t move ’em someplace else.” “Oh, she don’t care. She lets me.” Lennie had moved into the room again. Crooks scowled, but Lennie’s disarming smile defeated him. “Come on in and set a while,” Crooks said. “ ’Long as you won’t get out and leave me alone, you might as well set down.” His tone was a little more friendly. “All the boys gone into town, huh?” “All but old Candy. He just sets in the bunk house sharpening his pencil and sharpening and figuring.” Crooks adjusted his glasses. “Figuring? What’s Candy figuring about?” Lennie almost shouted, “ ’Bout the rabbits.” “You’re nuts,” said Crooks. “You’re crazy as a wedge. What rabbits you talkin’ about?” “The rabbits we’re gonna get, and I get to tend ’em, cut grass an’ give ’em water, an’ like that.” “Jus’ nuts,” said Crooks. “I don’t blame the guy you travel with for keepin’ you outa sight.” Lennie said quietly, “It ain’t no lie. We’re gonna do it. Gonna get a little place an’ live on the fatta the lan’.” Crooks settled himself more comfortably on his bunk. “Set down,” he invited. “Set down on the nail keg.” Lennie hunched down on the little barrel. “You think it’s a lie,” Lennie said, “But it ain’t no lie. Ever’ word’s the truth, an’ you can ast George.” Crooks put his dark chin into his p ink palm. You travel aroun with George, don’t ya?” “Sure. Me an’ him goes ever’ place together.” Crooks continued. “Sometimes he talks, and you don’t know what the hell he’s talkin’ about. Ain t that so?” He leaned forward, boring Lennie with his deep eyes. “Ain’t that so?” Yeah , sometimes.”  “Jus’ talks on, an’ you don’t know what the hell it’s all about?” “Yeah , sometimes. But , not always.” Crooks leaned forward over the edge of the bunk. “I ain’t a southern negro,” he said. “I was bom right here in California. My old man had a chicken ranch, ’bout ten acres. The white kids come to play at our place, an’ sometimes I went to play with them, and some of them was pretty nice. My ol’ man didn’t like that. I never knew till long later why he didn’t like that. But I know now.” He hesitated, and when he spoke again his voice was softer. “There wasn’t another colored family for miles around. And now there ain’t a colored man on this ranch an’ there’s jus’ one family in Soledad.” He laughed. “If I say something, why it’s just a nigger sayin’ it.” Lennie asked, “How long you think it’ll be before them pups will be old enough to pet?” Crooks laughed again. “A guy can talk to you  an’ be sure you won't go blabbin’. Couple of weeks an’ them pups’ll be all right. George knows what he’s about. Jus’ talks, an’ you don’t understand nothing.” He leaned forward excitedly. “This is just a nigger talkin’, an’ a busted-back nigger. So it don’t mean nothing, see? You couldn’t remember it anyways. I seen it over an’ over-a guy talkin’ to another guy and it don’t make no difference if he don’t hear or understand. The thing is, they’re talkin’, or they’re settin’ still not talkin’. It don’t make no difference, no difference.” His excitement had increased until he pounded his knee with this hand. “George can tell you screwy things, and it don’t matter. It’s just the talking. It’s just bein’ with another guy. That’s all.” He paused. His voice grew soft and persuasive. “S’pose George don’t come back no more. S’pose he took a powder and just ain’t coming back. What’ll you do then?” Lenme’s attention came gradually to what had been said. “What?” he demanded.  “I said s’pose George went into town tonight and you never heard of him no more.” Crooks pressed forward some kind of private victory. “Just s’pose that,” he repeated. “He won’t do it,” Lennie cried. “George wouldn’t do nothing like that. I been with George a long time. He’ll come back tonight — ” But the doubt was too much for him. “Don’t you think he will?” Crooks’ face lighted with pleasure in his torture. “Nobody can’t tell what a guy’ll do,” he observed calmly. “Le’s say he wants to come back and can’t. S’pose he gets killed or hurt so he can’t come back.” Lennie struggled to understand. “George won’t do nothing like that,” he repeated. “George is careful. He won’t get hurt. He ain’t never been hurt, ’cause he’s careful.” “Well, s’pose, jus’ s’pose he don’t come back. What’ll you do then?” Lennie’s face wrinkled with apprehension. “I don’ know. Say, what you doin’ anyways?” he  cried. “This ain’t true. George ain’t got hurt.” Crooks bored in on him. “Want me ta tell ya what’ll happen? They’ll take ya to the booby hatch. They’ll tie ya up with a collar, like a dog.” Suddenly Lennie’s eyes centered and grew quiet, and mad. He stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. “Who hurt George?” he demanded. Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on his bunk to get out of the way. “I was just supposin’,” he said. “George ain’t hurt. He’s all right. He’ll be back all right.” Lennie stood over him. “What you supposin’ for? Ain’t nobody goin’ to suppose no hurt to George.” Crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with his fingers. “Jus’ set down,” he said. “George ain’t hurt.” Lennie growled back to his seat on the nail i i . keg. “Ain’t nobody goin’ to talk no hurt to George,” he grumbled. Crooks said gently, “Maybe you can see now. You got George. You know he’s goin’ to come back. S’pose you didn’t have nobody. S’pose you couldn’t go into the bunk house and play rummy ’cause you was black. How’d you like j that? S’pose you had to sit out here an’ read j books. Sure you could play horseshoes till it got dark, but then you got to read books. Books j ain’t no good. A guy needs somebody— to be near him.” He whined, “A guy goes nuts if he j ain’t got nobody. Don’t make no difference who j the guy is, long’s he’s with you. I tell ya,” he J cried, “I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an’ he gets | sick.” j : . j “George gonna come back,” Lennie reassured himself in a frightened voice. “Maybe George j come back already. Maybe I better go see.” Crooks said, “I didn’t mean to scare you. j He’ll come back. I was talkin’ about myself. A  guy sets alone out here at night, maybe readin’ books or thinkin’ or stuff like that. Sometimes he gets thinkin’, an’ he got nothing to tell him what’s so an’ what ain’t so. Maybe if he sees somethin’, he don’t know whether it’s right or not. He can t turn to some other guy and ast him if he sees it too. He can’t tell. He got nothing to measure by. I seen things out here. I wasn’t drunk. I don’t know if I was asleep. If some guy was with me, he could tell me I was asleep, an’ then it would be all right. But I jus’ don’t know.” Crooks was looking across the room now, looking toward the window. Lennie said miserably, “George wun’t go away and leave me. I know George wun’t do that.” The stable buck went on dreamily, “I remember when I was a little kid on my old man’s chicken ranch. Had two brothers. They was always near me, always there. Used to sleep right in the same room, right in the same bed-all three. Had a strawberry patch. Had an alfalfa  patch. Used to turn the chickens out in the alfalfa on a sunny morning. My brothers’d set on a fence rail an’ watch ’em— white chickens they was.” Gradually Lennie’s interest came around to what was being said. “George says we’re gonna have alfalfa for the rabbits.” “What rabbits?” “We’re gonna have rabbits an’ a berry patch.” “You’re nuts.” “We are too. You ast George.” “You’re nuts.” Crooks was scornful. “I seen hunderds of men come by on the road an’ on the ranches, with their bindles on their back an’ that same damn thing in their heads. Hunderds of them. They come, an’ they quit an’ go on; an’ every damn one of ’em’s got a little piece of land in his head. An’ never a God damn one of ’em ever gets it. Just like heaven. Ever’body wants a little piece of lan’. I read plenty of books out here. Nobody never gets to heaven,  and nobody gets no land. It’s just in their head. They’re all the time talkin’ about it, but it’s jus’ in their head. He paused and looked toward the open door, for the horses were moving restlessly and the halter chains clinked. A horse whinnied. “I guess somebody’s out there,” Crooks said. “Maybe Slim. Slim comes in sometimes two, three times a night. Slim’s a real skinner. He looks out for his team.” He pulled himself painfully upright and moved toward the door. “That you, Slim?” he called. Candy’s voice answered. “Slim went in town. Say, you seen Lennie?” “Ya mean the big guy?” “Yeah. Seen him around any place?” “He’s in here,” Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and lay down. Candy stood in the doorway scratching his bald wrist and looking blindly into the lighted room. He made no attempt to enter. “Tell ya what, Lennie. I been figuring out about them rabbits.”  Crooks said irritably, “You can come in if you want.” Candy seemed embarrassed. “I do’ know. ’Course, if ya want me to.” “Come on in. If ever’body’s cornin’ in, you might just as well.” It was difficult for Crooks to conceal his pleasure with anger. Candy came in, but he was still embarrassed. “You got a nice cozy little place in here,” he said to Crooks. “Must be nice to have a room all to yourself this way.” “Sure,” said Crooks. “And a manure pile under the window. Sure, it’s swell.” Lennie broke in, “You said about them rabbits.” Candy leaned against the wall beside the broken collar while he scratched the wrist stump. “I been here a long time,” he said. “An’ Crooks been here a long time. This’s the first time I ever been in his room.” Crooks said darkly, “Guys don’t come into a colored man’s room very much. Nobody been here but Slim. Slim an’ the boss.”  Candy quickly changed the subject. “Slim’s as good a skinner as I ever seen.” Lennie leaned toward the old swamper. “About them rabbits,” he insisted. Candy smiled. “I got it figured out. We can make some money on them rabbits if we go about it right.” “But I get to tend ’em,” Lennie broke in. “George says I get to tend ’em. He promised.” Crooks interrupted brutally. “You guys is just kiddin’ yourself. You’ll talk about it a hell of a lot, but you won’t get no land. You’ll be a swamper here till they take you out in a box. Hell, I seen too many guys. Lennie here’ll quit an’ be on the road in two, three weeks. Seems like ever’ guy got land in his head.” Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. “You God damn right we’re gonna do it. George says we are. We got the money right now.” “Yeah?” said Crooks. “An’ where’s George now? In town in a whore house. That’s where your money’s goin’. Jesus, I seen it happen too  many times. I seen too many guys with land in their head. They never get none under their hand.” Candy cried, “Sure they all want it. Everybody wants a little bit of land, not much. Jus’ som’thin’ that was his. Som’thin’ he could live on and there couldn’t nobody throw him off of it. I never had none. I planted crops for damn near ever’body in this state, but they wasn’t my crops, and when I harvested ’em, it wasn’t none of my harvest. But we gonna do it now, and don’t you make no mistake about that. George ain’t got the money in town. That money’s in the bank. Me an’ Lennie an’ George. We gonna have a room to ourself. We’re gonna have a dog an’ rabbits an’ chickens. We’re gonna have green com an’ maybe a cow or a goat.” He stopped, overwhelmed with his picture. Crooks asked, “You say you got the money?” “Damn right. We got most of it. Just a little bit more to get. Have it all in one month. George got the land all picked out, too.” * Crooks reached around and explored his spine with his hand. “I never, seen a guy really do it,” he said. “I seen guys nearly crazy with loneliness for land, but ever’ time a whore house or a blackjack game took what it takes.” He hesitated. “ , If you , guys would want a hand to work for nothing— just his keep, why I’d come an’ lend a hand. I ain’t so crippled I can’t work like a son-of-a-bitch if I want to.” “Any you boys seen Curley?” They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley’s wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. She breathed strongly, as though she had been running. “Curley ain’t been here,” Candy said sourly. She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other. And her eyes traveled from one face to another. “They left all the weak ones here,” she said finally. “T hink  I don’t know where they all went? Even Curley. I know where they all went.” Lennie watched her, fascinated; but Candy and Crooks were scowling down away from her eyes. Candy said, “Then if you know, why you want to ast us where Curley is at?” She regarded them amusedly. “Funny thing,” she said. “If I catch any one man, and he’s alone, I get along fine with him. But just let two of the guys get together an’ you won’t talk. Jus’ nothing but mad.” She dropped her fingers and put her hands on her hips. “You’re all scared of each other, that’s what. Ever’ one of you’s scared the rest is goin’ to get something on you.” After a pause Crooks said, “Maybe you better go along to your own house now. We don’t want no trouble.” “Well, I ain’t giving you no trouble. Think I don’t like to talk to somebody ever’ once in a while? Think I like to stick in that house alia time?” Candy laid the stump of his wrist on his knee and rubbed it gently with his hand. He said accusingly, “You gotta husban’. You got no call foolin’ aroun’ with other guys, causin’ trouble.” The girl flared up. “Sure I gotta husban’. You all seen him. Swell guy, ain’t he? Spends all his time sayin’ what he’s gonna do to guys he don’t like, and he don’t like nobody. Think I’m gonna stay in that two-by-four house and listen how Curley’s gonna lead with his left twict, and then bring in the oP right cross? ‘One-two’ he says. ‘Jus the oP one-two an’ he’ll go down.’” She paused and her face lost its sullenness and grew interested. “Say-what happened to Curley’s han’?” There was an embarrassed silence. Candy stole a look at Lennie. Then he coughed. “Why • ,urley , he got his han’ caught in a machine, ma’am. Bust his han ’.” She watched for a moment, and then she laughed. “Baloney! What you think you’re sellin’ me? Curley started som’pin’ he didn’ finish  Caught in a machine— baloney! Why, he ain’t give nobody the good oF one-two since he got his han’ bust. Who bust him?” Candy repeated sullenly, “Got it caught in a machine.” “Awright,” she said contemptuously. “Awright, cover ’im up if ya wanta. Whatta I care? You bindle bums think you’re so damn good. Whatta ya think I am, a kid? I tell ya I could of went with shows. Not jus’ one, neither. An* a guy tol’ me he could put me in pitchers,he was breathless with indignation. Sat’iday night. Ever’body out doin’ som’pin’. Ever’body! An’ what am I doin’? Standin’ here talkin’ to a bunch of bindle stiffs— a nigger an’ a dum-dum and a lousy oF sheep— an’ likin’ it because they ain’t nobody else.” Lennie watched her, his mouth half open. Crooks had retired into the terrible protective dignity of the negro. But a change came over old Candy. He stood up suddenly and knocked his nail keg over backward. “I had enough,” he  said angrily. “You ain’t wanted here. We told you you ain’t. An’ I tell ya, you got floozy idears about what us guys amounts to. You ain’t got sense enough in that chicken head to even see that we ain’t stiffs. S’pose you get us canned. S’pose you do. You think we’ll hit the highway an’ look for another lousy two-bit job like this. You don’t know that we got our own ranch to go to, an’ our own house. We ain’t got to stay here. We gotta house and chickens an’ fruit trees an’ a place a hunderd time prettier than this. An’ we got fren’s, that’s what we got. Maybe there was a time when we was scared of gettin’ canned, but we ain’t no more. We got our own lan’, and it’s ours, an’ we c’n go to it.” Curley’s wife laughed at him. “Baloney,” she said. “I seen too many you guys. If you had two bits in the worl’, why you’d be in gettin’ two shots of corn with it and suckin’ the bottom of the glass. I know you guys.” Candy’s face had grown redder and redder, but before she was done speaking, he had con trol of himself. He was the master of the situation. “I might of knew,” he said gently. “Maybe you just better go along an’ roll your hoop. We ain’t got nothing to say to you at all. We know what we got, and we don’t care whether you know it or not. So maybe you better jus’ scatter along now, ’cause Curley maybe ain’t gonna like his wife out in the bam with us ‘bindle stiffs.’ ” She looked from one face to another, and they were all closed against her. And she looked longest at Lennie, until he dropped his eyes in embarrassment. Suddenly she said, “Where’d you get them bruises on your face?” Lennie looked up guiltily. “Who— me?” “Yeah, you.” Lennie looked to Candy for help, and then he looked at his lap again. “He got his han’ caught in a machine,” he said. Curley’s wife laughed. “O.K., Machine. I’ll talk to you later. I like machines.” Candy broke in. “You let this guy alone. * m Don’t you do no messing aroun’ with him. I’m gonna tell George what you says. George won’t have you messin’ with Lennie.” “Who’s George?” she asked. “The little guy you come with?” Lennie smiled happily. “That’s him,” he said. “That’s the guy, an’ he’s gonna let me tend the rabbits.” “Well, if that’s all you want, I might get a couple rabbits myself.” Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. “I had enough,” he said coldly. “You got no rights cornin’ in a colored man’s room. You got no rights messing around in here at all. Now you jus’ get out, an’ get out quick. If you don’t, I’m gonna ast the boss not to ever let you come in the bam no more.” She turned on him in scorn. “Listen, Nigger,” she said. “You know what I can do to you if you open your trap?” Crooks stared hopelessly at her, and then he sat down on his bunk and drew into himself.  She closed on him. “You know what I could do?” Crooks seemed to grow smaller, and he pressed himself against the wall. “Yes, ma’am.” “Well, you keep your place then, Nigger. I could get you strung up on a tree so easy it ain’t even funny.” Crooks had reduced himself to nothing. There was no personality, no ego— nothing to arouse either like or dislike. He said, “Yes, ma’am,” and his voice was toneless. For a moment she stood over him as though waiting for him to move so that she could whip at him again; but Crooks sat perfectly still, his eyes averted, everything that might be hurt drawn in. She turned at last to the other two. Old Candy was watching her, fascinated. “If you was to do that, we’d tell,” he said quietly. “We’d tell about you framin’ Crooks.” “Tell an’ be damned,” she cried. “Nobody’d listen to you, an’ you know it. Nobody’d listen to you.” Candy subsided. “No ,e agreed. “Nobody’d listen to us.” Lennie whined, “I wisht George was here. I wisht George was here.” Candy stepped over to him. “Don’t you worry none,” he said. “I jus’ heard the guys cornin’ in. George’ll be in the bunk house right now, I bet.” He turned to Curley’s wife. “You better go home now,” he said quietly. “If you go right now, we won’t tell Curley you was here.” She appraised him coolly. “I ain’t sure you heard nothing.” “Better not take no chances,” he said. “If you ain’t sure, you better take the safe way.” She turned to Lennie. “I’m glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He got it cornin’ to him. Sometimes I’d like to bust him myself.” She slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark bam. And while she went through the bam, the halter chains rattled, and some horses snorted and some stamped their feet. Crooks seemed to come slowly out of the lay ers of protection he had put on. “Was that the truth what you said about the guys come back?” he asked. “Sure. I heard ’em.” “Well, I didn’t hear nothing.” “The gate banged,” Candy said, and he went on, “Jesus Christ, Curley’s wife can move quiet. I guess she had a lot of practice, though.” Crooks avoided the whole subject now. “Maybe you guys better go,” he said. “I ain’t sure I want you in here no more. A colored man got to have some rights even if he don’t like ’em.” Candy said, “That bitch didn’t ought to of said that to you.” “It wasn’t nothing,” Crooks said dully. “You guys cornin’ in an’ settin’ made me forget. What she says is true.” The horses snorted out in the barn and the chains rang and a voice called, “Lennie. Oh, Lennie. You in the bam?” “It’s George,” Lennie cried. And he answered, “Here, George. I’m right in here.” H In a second George stood framed in the door, and he looked disapprovingly about. “What you doin’ in Crooks’ room. You hadn’t ought to be here.” j Crooks nodded. “I tol’ ’em, but they come in anyways.” “Well, why’n’t you kick ’em out?” j “I di’n’t care much,” said Crooks. “Lennie’s a nice fella.” Now Candy aroused himself. “Oh, George! I been figurin’ and figurin’. I got it doped out how we can even make some money on them rab* bits.” George scowled. “I thought I tol’ you not to tell nobody about that.” Candy was crestfallen.“Didn’t tell nobody but Crooks.” i George said, “Well you guys get outta here. Jesus, seems like I can’t go away for a minute.” I Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward j the door. Crooks called, “Candy!” “Huh?’’  “ ’Member what I said about hoein’ and doin’ odd jobs?” “Yeah,” said Candy. “I remember.” “Well, jus’ forget it,” said Crooks. “I didn’ mean it. Jus’ foolin’. I wouldn’ want to go no place like that.” “Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Goodnight.” The three men went out of the door. As they went through the bam the horses snorted and the halter chains rattled. Crooks sat on his bunk and looked at the door for a moment, and then he reached for the liniment bottle. He pulled out his shirt in back, poured a little liniment in his pink palm and, reaching around, he fell slowly to rubbing his back. i  ONE end of the great barn was piled high with new ha y and over the pile hung the four-taloned jackson fork suspended from its pulley. The hay came down like a mountain slope to the other end of the bam, and there was a level place as yet unfilled with the new crop. At the sides the feeding racks were visible, and between the slats the heads of horses could be seen. It was Sunday afternoon. The resting horses nibbled the remaining wisps of hay, and they stamped their feet and they bit the wood of the mangers and rattled the halter chains. The afternoon sun sliced in through the cracks of the bam walls and lay in bright lines on the hay. There was the buzz of flies in the air, the lazy afternoon humming.  From outside came the clang of horseshoes on the playing peg and the shouts of men, playing, encouraging, jeering. But in the barn it was quiet and humming and lazy and warm. Only Lennie was in the barn, and Lennie sat in the hay beside a packing case under a manger in the end of the barn that had not been filled with hay. Lennie sat in the hay and looked at a little dead puppy that lay in front of him. Lennie looked at it for a long time, and then he put out his huge hand and stroked it, stroked it clear from one end to the other. And Lennie said softly to the puppy, “Why do you got to get killed? You ain’t so little as mice. I didn’t bounce you hard.” He bent the pup’s head up and looked in its face, and he said to it, “Now maybe George ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits, if he fin’s out you got killed.” He scooped a little hollow and laid the puppy in it and covered it over with hay, out of sight; but he continued to stare at the mound he had made. He said, “This ain’t no bad thing like H I got to go hide in the brush. Oh! no. This ain’t. I’ll tell George I foun’ it dead.” He unburied the puppy and inspected it, and he stroked it from ears to tail. He went on sorrowfully, “But he’ll know. George always knows. He’ll say, ‘You done it. Don’t try to put nothing over on me.’ An’ he’ll say, ‘Now jus’ for that you don’t get to tend no rabbits!’ ” Suddenly his anger arose. “God damn you,” he cried. “Why do you got to get killed? You ain’t so little as mice.” He picked up the pup and hurled it from him. He turned his back on it. He sat bent over his knees and he whispered, “Now I won’t get to tend the rabbits. Now he won’t let me.” He rocked himself back and forth in his sorrow. From outside came the clang of horseshoes on the iron stake, and then a little chorus of cries. Lennie got up and brought the puppy back and laid it on the hay and sat down. He stroked the pup again. “You wasn’t big enough,” he said. “They tol’ me and tol’ me you wasn’t. I di’n’t  know you’d get killed so easy.” He worked his fingers on the pup’s limp ear. “Maybe George won’t care,” he said. “This here God damn little son-of-a-bitch wasn’t nothing to George.” Curley’s wife came around the end of the last stall. She came very quietly, so that Lennie didn’t see her. She wore her bright cotton dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her face was made up and the little sausage curls were all in place. She was quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her. In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers. He looked sullenly up at her. She said, “What you got there, sonny boy?” Lennie glared at her. “George says I ain’t to have nothing to do with you— talk to you or nothing.” She laughed. “George giving you orders about everything?” Lennie looked down at the hay. “Says I can’t tend no rabbits if I talk to you or anything.” She said quietly, “He’s scared Curley’ll get  mad. Well, Curley got his arm in a sling— an’ if Curley gets tough, you can break his other han’. You didn’t put nothing over on me about gettin’ it caught in no machine.” But Lennie was not to be drawn. “No, sir. I ain’t gonna talk to you or nothing.” She knelt in the hay beside him. “Listen,” she said. “All the guys got a horseshoe tenement goin’ on. It’s on’y about four o’clock. None of them guys is goin’ to leave that tenement. Why can’t I talk to you? I never get to talk to nobody. I get awful lonely.” Lennie said, “Well, I ain’t supposed to talk to you or nothing.” “I get lonely,” she said. “You can talk to people, but I can’t talk to nobody but Curley. Else he gets mad. How’d you like not to talk to anybody?” Lennie said, “Well, I ain’t supposed to. George’s scared I’ll get in trouble.” She changed the subject. “What you got covered up there?”  Then all of Lennie’s woe came back on him. “Jus’ my pup,” he said sadly. “Jus’ my little pup.” And he swept the hay from on top of it. “Why, he’s dead,” she cried. “He was so little,” said Lennie. “I was jus’ playin’ with him , an’ he made like he’s gonna bite me , an’ I made like I was gonna smack him , an’ , an’ I done it. An’ then he was dead.” She consoled him. “Don’t you worry none. He was jus’ a mutt. You can get another one easy. The whole country is fulla mutts.” “It ain’t that so much,” Lennie explained miserably. “George ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits now.” “Why don’t he?” “Well, he said if I done any more bad things he ain’t gonna let me tend the rabbits.” She moved closer to him and she spoke soothingly. “Don’t you worry about talkin’ to me. Listen to the guys yell out there. They got four  dollars bet in that tenement. None of them ain’t gonna leave till it’s over.” “If George sees me talkin’ to you he’ll give me hell,” Lennie said cautiously. “He tol’ me so.” Her face grew angry. “Wha’s the matter with me?” she cried. “Ain’t I got a right to talk to nobody? Whatta they think I am, anyways? You’re a nice guy. I don’t know why I can’t talk to you. I ain’t doin’ no harm to you.” “Well, George says you’ll get us in a mess.” “Aw, nuts!” she said. “What kinda harm am I doin’ to you? Seems like they ain’t none of them cares how I gotta live. I tell you I ain’t used to livin’ like this. I coulda made somethin’ of myself.” She said darkly, “Maybe I will yet.” And then her words tumbled out in a passion of communication, as though she hurried before her listener could be taken away. “I lived right in Salinas,” she said. “Come there when I was a kid. Well, a show come through, an’ I met one of the actors. He says I could go with that show.  But my ol’ lady wouldn’ let me. She says because I was on’y fifteen. But the guy says I coulda. If I’d went, I wouldn’t be livin’ like this, you bet.” Lennie stroked the pup back and forth. “We gonna have a little place— an’ rabbits,” he explained. She went on with her story quickly, before she should be interrupted. “ ’Nother time I met a guy, an’ he was in pitchers. Went out to the Riverside Dance Palace with him. He says he was gonna put me in the movies. Says I was a natural. Soon’s he got back to Hollywood he was gonna write to me about it.” She looked closely at Lennie to see whether she was impressing him. “I never got that letter,” she said. “I always thought my oP lady stole it. Well, I wasn’t gonna stay no place where I couldn’t get nowhere or make something of myself, an’ where they stole your letters. I ast her if she stole it, too, an’ she says no. So I married Curley. Met him out to the Riverside Dance Palace  that same night.” She demanded, “You listenin’?” “Me? Sure.” “Well, I ain’t told this to nobody before. Maybe I ought’n to. I don’ like Curley. He ain’t a nice fella.” And because she had confided in him, she moved closer to Lennie and sat beside him. “Coulda been in the movies, an’ had nice clothes— all them nice clothes like they wear. An’ I coulda sat in them big hotels, an’ had pitchers took of me. When they had them previews I coulda went to them, an’ spoke in the radio, an’ it wouldn’ta cost me a cent because I was in the pitcher. An’ all them nice clothes like they wear. Because this guy says I was a natural.” She looked up at Lennie, and she made a small grand gesture with her arm and hand to show that she could act. The fingers trailed after her leading wrist, and her little finger stuck out grandly from the rest. Lennie sighed deeply. From outside came the clang of a horseshoe on metal, and then a chorus  of cheers. “Somebody made a ringer,” said Curley’s wife. Now the light was lifting as the sun went down, and the sun streaks climbed up the wall and fell over the feeding racks and over the heads of the horses. Lennie said, “Maybe if I took this pup out and throwed him away George wouldn’t never know. An’ then I could tend the rabbits without no trouble.” Curley’s wife said angrily, “Don’t you think of nothing but rabbits?” “We gonna have a little place,” Lennie explained patiently. “We gonna have a house an’ a garden and a place for alfalfa, an’ that alfalfa is for the rabbits, an’ I take a sack and get it all fulla alfalfa and then I take it to the rabbits.” She asked, “What makes you so nuts about rabbits?” Lennie had to think carefully before",87.35,7.0,5.5,6.09,7.5,1.58,442,6.285714285714286,8.85,5th and 6th grade
1,Mr. Tickle,"This time he kept on tickling until soon the teacher was laughing out loud and saying, “Stop it! Stop it!” over and over again. All the children were laughing too at such a funny sight. There was a terrible pandemonium. Eventually, Mr Tickle thought that he had had enough fun, so he gave the teacher one more tickle for luck, and then very quietly brought his arm back through the open window. Chuckling to himself, he jumped down from the window, leaving the poor teacher to explain what it was all about.  Which of course he couldn’t. Then Mr Tickle went into town. And what a day Mr Tickle had. He tickled the policeman on traffic duty at the crossroads in the middle of town. It caused an enormous traffic jam. He tickled the greengrocer just as he was piling apples neatly in his shop window. The greengrocer fell over backwards, and the apples rolled all over the shop. At the railway station, the guard was about to wave his flag for the train to leave. As he lifted his arm in the air, Mr Tickle tickled him. And every time he tried to wave his flag, Mr Tickle tickled him until the train was ten minutes late leaving the station and all the passengers were furious. That day Mr Tickle tickled everybody. He tickled the doctor. He tickled the butcher. He even tickled old Mr Stamp, the postman",84.07,7.3,4.7,6.89,5.8,5.58,20,5.75,8.39,5th and 6th grade
2,Riders of the Purple Sager,"breath, “is you  can't ride away. Mebbe realizin' it accounts for my grabbin' you--that  way, as much as the crazy boy's rapture your words gave me. I don't  understand myself.... But the hell of this game is--you can't ride away.”    “Lassiter!... What on earth do you mean? I'm an absolutely free woman.”    “You ain't absolutely anythin' of the kind.... I reckon I've got to tell  you!”    “Tell me all. It's uncertainty that makes me a coward. It's faith and  hope--blind love, if you will, that makes me miserable. Every day I  awake believing--still believing. The day grows, and with it doubts,  fears, and that black bat hate that bites hotter and hotter into my  heart. Then comes night--I pray--I pray for all, and for myself--I  sleep--and I awake free once more, trustful, faithful, to believe--to  hope! Then, O my God! I grow and live a thousand years till night  again!... But if you want to see me a woman, tell me why I can't ride  away--tell me what more I'm to lose--tell me the worst.”    “Jane, you're watched. There's no single move of yours, except when  you're hid in your house, that ain't seen by sharp eyes. The cottonwood  grove's full of creepin', crawlin' men. Like Indians in the grass. When  you rode, which wasn't often lately, the sage was full of sneakin' men.  At night they crawl under your windows into the court, an' I reckon into  the house. Jane Withersteen, you know, never locked a door! This here  grove's a hummin' bee-hive of mysterious happenin's. Jane, it ain't so  much that these soles keep out of my way as me keepin' out of theirs.  They're goin' to try to kill me. That's plain. But mebbe I'm as hard to  shoot in the back as in the face. So far I've seen fit to watch  only. This all means, Jane, that you're a marked woman. You can't get  away--not now. Mebbe later, when you're broken, you might. But that's  sure doubtful. Jane, you're to lose the cattle that's left--your home  an' ranch--an' Amber Spring. You can't even hide a sack of gold! For it  couldn't be slipped out of the house, day or night, an' hid or buried,  let alone be rid off with. You may lose all. I'm tellin' you, Jane,  hopin' to prepare you, if the worst does come. I told you once before  about that strange power I've got to feel things.”    “Lassiter, what can I do?”    “Nothin', I reckon, except know what's comin' an' wait an' be game. If  you'd let me make a call on Tull, an' a long-deferred call on--”    “Hush!... Hush!” she whispered.    “Well, even that wouldn't help you any in the end.”    “What does it mean? Oh, what does it mean? I am my father's daughter--a  Mormon, yet I can't see! I've not failed in religion--in duty. For years  I've given with a free and full heart. When my father died I was rich.  If I'm still rich it's because I couldn't find enough ways to become  poor. What am I, what are my possessions to set in motion such intensity  of secret oppression?”    “Jane, the mind behind it all is an empire builder.”    “But, Lassiter, I would give freely--all I own to avert this--this  wretched thing. If I gave--that would leave me with faith still. Surely  my--my churchmen think of my soul? If I lose my trust in them--”    “Child, be still!” said Lassiter, with a dark dignity that had in it  something of pity. “You are a woman, fine en' big an' strong, an' your  heart matches your size. But in mind you're a child. I'll say a little  more--then I'm done. I'll never mention this again. Among many thousands  of women you're one who has bucked against your churchmen. They tried  you out, an' failed of persuasion, an' finally of threats. You meet now  the cold steel of a will as far from Christlike as the universe is wide.  You're to be broken. Your body's to be held, given to some man, made,  if possible, to bring children into the world. But your soul?... What do  they care for your soul?”        CHAPTER XIII. SOLITUDE AND STORM    In his hidden valley Venters awakened from sleep, and his ears rang  with innumerable melodies from full-throated mockingbirds, and his eyes  opened wide upon the glorious golden shaft of sunlight shining through  the great stone bridge. The circle of cliffs surrounding Surprise Valley  lay shrouded in morning mist, a dim blue low down along the terraces,  a creamy, moving cloud along the ramparts. The oak forest in the center  was a plumed and tufted oval of gold.    He saw Bess under the spruces. Upon her complete recovery of strength  she always rose with the dawn. At the moment she was feeding the  quail she had tamed. And she had begun to tame the mocking-birds. They  fluttered among the branches overhead and some left off their songs to  flit down and shyly hop near the twittering quail. Little gray and white  rabbits crouched in the grass, now nibbling, now laying long ears flat  and watching the dogs.    Venters's swift glance took in the brightening valley, and Bess and her  pets, and Ring and Whitie. It swept over all to return again and rest  upon the girl. She had changed. To the dark trousers and blouse she had  added moccasins of her own make, but she no longer resembled a boy.  No eye could have failed to mark the rounded contours of a woman. The  change had been to grace and beauty. A glint of warm gold gleamed from  her hair, and a tint of red shone in the clear dark brown of cheeks. The  haunting sweetness of her lips and eyes, that earlier had been illusive,  a promise, had become a living fact. She fitted harmoniously into that  wonderful setting; she was like Surprise Valley--wild and beautiful.    Venters leaped out of his cave to begin the day.    He had postponed his journey to Cottonwoods until after the passing of  the summer rains. The rains were due soon. But until their arrival and  the necessity for his trip to the village he sequestered in a far corner  of mind all thought of peril, of his past life, and almost that of the  present. It was enough to live. He did not want to know what lay hidden  in the dim and distant future. Surprise Valley had enchanted him. In  this home of the cliff-dwellers there were peace and quiet and solitude,  and another thing, wondrous as the golden morning shaft of sunlight,  that he dared not ponder over long enough to understand.    The solitude he had hated when alone he had now come to love. He was  assimilating something from this valley of gleams and shadows. From this  strange girl he was assimilating more.    The day at hand resembled many days gone before. As Venters had no tools  with which to build, or to till the terraces, he remained idle. Beyond  the cooking of the simple fare there were no tasks. And as there were no  tasks, there was no system. He and Bess began one thing, to leave it;  to begin another, to leave that; and then do nothing but lie under the  spruces and watch the great cloud-sails majestically move along the  ramparts, and dream and dream. The valley was a golden, sunlit world.  It was silent. The sighing wind and the twittering quail and the singing  birds, even the rare and seldom-occurring hollow crack of a sliding  weathered stone, only thickened and deepened that insulated silence.    Venters and Bess had vagrant minds.    “Bess, did I tell you about my horse Wrangle?” inquired Venters.    “A hundred times,” she replied.    “Oh, have I? I'd forgotten. I want you to see him. He'll carry us both.”    “I'd like to ride him. Can he run?”    “Run? He's a demon. Swiftest horse on the sage! I hope he'll stay in  that canyon.    “He'll stay.”    They left camp to wander along the terraces, into the aspen ravines,  under the gleaming walls. Ring and Whitie wandered in the fore, often  turning, often trotting back, open-mouthed and solemn-eyed and happy.  Venters lifted his gaze to the grand archway over the entrance to  the valley, and Bess lifted hers to follow his, and both were silent.  Sometimes the bridge held their attention for a long time. To-day a  soaring eagle attracted them.    “How he sails!” exclaimed Bess. “I wonder where his mate is?”    “She's at the nest. It's on the bridge in a crack near the top. I see  her often. She's almost white.”    They wandered on down the terrace, into the shady, sun-flecked forest.  A brown bird fluttered crying from a bush. Bess peeped into the leaves.  “Look! A nest and four little birds. They're not afraid of us. See how  they open their mouths. They're hungry.”    Rabbits rustled the dead brush and pattered away. The forest was full  of a drowsy hum of insects. Little darts of purple, that were running  quail, crossed the glades. And a plaintive, sweet peeping came from the  coverts. Bess's soft step disturbed a sleeping lizard that scampered  away over the leaves. She gave chase and caught it, a slim creature of  nameless color but of exquisite beauty.    “Jewel eyes,” she said. “It's like a rabbit--afraid. We won't eat you.  There--go.”    Murmuring water drew their steps down into a shallow shaded ravine where  a brown brook brawled softly over mossy stones. Multitudes of strange,  gray frogs with white spots and black eyes lined the rocky bank and  leaped only at close approach. Then Venters's eye descried a very thin,  very long green snake coiled round a sapling. They drew closer and  closer till they could have touched it. The snake had no fear and  watched them with scintillating eyes.    “It's pretty,” said Bess. “How tame! I thought snakes always ran.”    “No. Even the rabbits didn't run here till the dogs chased them.”    On and on they wandered to the wild jumble of massed and broken  fragments of cliff at the west end of the valley. The roar of the  disappearing stream dinned in their ears. Into this maze of rocks they  threaded a tortuous way, climbing, descending, halting to gather wild  plums and great lavender lilies, and going on at the will of fancy. Idle  and keen perceptions guided them equally.    “Oh, let us climb there!” cried Bess, pointing upward to a small space  of terrace left green and shady between huge abutments of broken cliff.  And they climbed to the nook and rested and looked out across the valley  to the curling column of blue smoke from their campfire. But the cool  shade and the rich grass and the fine view were not what they had  climbed for. They could not have told, although whatever had drawn  them was well-satisfying. Light, sure-footed as a mountain goat, Bess  pattered down at Venters's heels; and they went on, calling the dogs,  eyes dreamy and wide, listening to the wind and the bees and the  crickets and the birds.    Part of the time Ring and Whitie led the way, then Venters, then Bess;  and the direction was not an object. They left the sun-streaked shade of  the oaks, brushed the long grass of the meadows, entered the green  and fragrant swaying willows, to stop, at length, under the huge old  cottonwoods where the beavers were busy.    Here they rested and watched. A dam of brush and logs and mud and stones  backed the stream into a little lake. The round, rough beaver houses  projected from the water. Like the rabbits, the beavers had become shy.  Gradually, however, as Venters and Bess knelt low, holding the dogs, the  beavers emerged to swim with logs and gnaw at cottonwoods and pat mud  walls with their paddle-like tails, and, glossy and shiny in the sun, to  go on with their strange, persistent industry. They were the builders.  The lake was a mud-hole, and the immediate environment a scarred and  dead region, but it was a wonderful home of wonderful animals.    “Look at that one--he puddles in the mud,” said Bess. “And there! See  him dive! Hear them gnawing! I'd think they'd break their teeth. How's  it they can stay out of the water and under the water?”    And she laughed.    Then Venters and Bess wandered farther, and, perhaps not all  unconsciously this time, wended their slow steps to the cave of the  cliff-dwellers, where she liked best to go.    The tangled thicket and the long slant of dust and little chips of  weathered rock and the steep bench of stone and the worn steps all  were arduous work for Bess in the climbing. But she gained the shelf,  gasping, hot of cheek, glad of eye, with her hand in Venters's. Here  they rested. The beautiful valley glittered below with its millions  of wind-turned leaves bright-faced in the sun, and the mighty bridge  towered heavenward, crowned with blue sky. Bess, however, never rested  for long. Soon she was exploring, and Venters followed; she dragged  forth from corners and shelves a multitude of crudely fashioned and  painted pieces of pottery, and he carried them. They peeped down into  the dark holes of the kivas, and Bess gleefully dropped a stone and  waited for the long-coming hollow sound to rise. They peeped into the  little globular houses, like mud-wasp nests, and wondered if these had  been store-places for grain, or baby cribs, or what; and they crawled  into the larger houses and laughed when they bumped their heads on the  low roofs, and they dug in the dust of the floors. And they brought from  dust and darkness armloads of treasure which they carried to the light.  Flints and stones and strange curved sticks and pottery they found; and  twisted grass rope that crumbled in their hands, and bits of whitish  stone which crushed to powder at a touch and seemed to vanish in the  air.    “That white stuff was bone,” said Venters, slowly. “Bones of a  cliff-dweller.”    “No!” exclaimed Bess.    “Here's another piece. Look!... Whew! dry, powdery smoke! That's bone.”    Then it was that Venters's primitive, childlike mood, like a savage's,  seeing, yet unthinking, gave way to the encroachment of civilized  thought. The world had not been made for a single day's play or fancy or  idle watching. The world was old. Nowhere could be gotten a better  idea of its age than in this gigantic silent tomb. The gray ashes in  Venters's hand had once been bone of a human being like himself. The  pale gloom of the cave had shadowed people long ago. He saw that Bess  had received the same shock--could not in moments such as this escape  her feeling living, thinking destiny.    “Bern, people have lived here,” she said, with wide, thoughtful eyes.    “Yes,” he replied.    “How long ago?”    “A thousand years and more.”    “What were they?”    “Cliff-dwellers. Men who had enemies and made their homes high out of  reach.”    “They had to fight?”    “Yes.”    “They fought for--what?”    “For life. For their homes, food, children, parents--for their women!”    “Has the world changed any in a thousand years?”    “I don't know--perhaps a little.”    “Have men?”    “I hope so--I think so.”    “Things crowd into my mind,” she went on, and the wistful light in her  eyes told Venters the truth of her thoughts. “I've ridden the border of  Utah. I've seen people--know how they live--but they must be few of all  who are living. I had my books and I studied them. But all that doesn't  help me any more. I want to go out into the big world and see it. Yet I  want to stay here more. What's to become of us? Are we cliff-dwellers?  We're alone here. I'm happy when I don't think. These--these bones that  fly into dust--they make me sick and a little afraid. Did the people who  lived here once have the same feelings as we have? What was the good of  their living at all? They're gone! What's the meaning of it all--of us?”    “Bess, you ask more than I can tell. It's beyond me. Only there was  laughter here once--and now there's silence. There was life--and now  there's death. Men cut these little steps, made these arrow-heads and  mealing-stones, plaited the ropes we found, and left their bones to  crumble in our fingers. As far as time is concerned it might all have  been yesterday. We're here to-day. Maybe we're higher in the scale of  human beings--in intelligence. But who knows? We can't be any higher in  the things for which life is lived at all.”    “What are they?”    “Why--I suppose relationship, friendship--love.”    “Love!”    “Yes. Love of man for woman--love of woman for man. That's the nature,  the meaning, the best of life itself.”    She said no more. Wistfulness of glance deepened into sadness.    “Come, let us go,” said Venters.    Action brightened her. Beside him, holding his hand she slipped down  the shelf, ran down the long, steep slant of sliding stones, out of the  cloud of dust, and likewise out of the pale gloom.    “We beat the slide,” she cried.    The miniature avalanche cracked and roared, and rattled itself into an  inert mass at the base of the incline. Yellow dust like the gloom of the  cave, but not so changeless, drifted away on the wind; the roar clapped  in echo from the cliff, returned, went back, and came again to die  in the hollowness. Down on the sunny terrace there was a different  atmosphere. Ring and Whitie leaped around Bess. Once more she was  smiling, gay, and thoughtless, with the dream-mood in the shadow of her  eyes.    “Bess, I haven't seen that since last summer. Look!” said Venters,  pointing to the scalloped edge of rolling purple clouds that peeped over  the western wall. “We're in for a storm.”    “Oh, I hope not. I'm afraid of storms.”    “Are you? Why?”    “Have you ever been down in one of these walled-up pockets in a bad  storm?”    “No, now I think of it, I haven't.”    “Well, it's terrible. Every summer I get scared to death and hide  somewhere in the dark. Storms up on the sage are bad, but nothing to  what they are down here in the canyons. And in this little valley--why,  echoes can rap back and forth so quick they'll split our ears.”    “We're perfectly safe here, Bess.”    “I know. But that hasn't anything to do with it. The truth is I'm afraid  of lightning and thunder, and thunder-claps hurt my head. If we have a  bad storm, will you stay close to me?”    “Yes.”    When they got back to camp the afternoon was closing, and it was  exceedingly sultry. Not a breath of air stirred the aspen leaves, and  when these did not quiver the air was indeed still. The dark-purple  clouds moved almost imperceptibly out of the west.    “What have we for supper?” asked Bess.    “Rabbit.”    “Bern, can't you think of another new way to cook rabbit?” went on Bess,  with earnestness.    “What do you think I am--a magician?” retorted Venters.    “I wouldn't dare tell you. But, Bern, do you want me to turn into a  rabbit?”    There was a dark-blue, merry flashing of eyes and a parting of lips;  then she laughed. In that moment she was naive and wholesome.    “Rabbit seems to agree with you,” replied Venters. “You are well and  strong--and growing very pretty.”    Anything in the nature of compliment he had never before said to her,  and just now he responded to a sudden curiosity to see its effect. Bess  stared as if she had not heard aright, slowly blushed, and completely  lost her poise in happy confusion.    “I'd better go right away,” he continued, “and fetch supplies from  Cottonwoods.”    A startlingly swift change in the nature of her agitation made him  reproach himself for his abruptness.    “No, no, don't go!” she said. “I didn't mean--that about the rabbit.  I--I was only trying to be--funny. Don't leave me all alone!”    “Bess, I must go sometime.”    “Wait then. Wait till after the storms.”    The purple cloud-bank darkened the lower edge of the setting sun, crept  up and up, obscuring its fiery red heart, and finally passed over the  last ruddy crescent of its upper rim.    The intense dead silence awakened to a long, low, rumbling roll of  thunder.    “Oh!” cried Bess, nervously.    “We've had big black clouds before this without rain,” said Venters.  “But there's no doubt about that thunder. The storms are coming. I'm  glad. Every rider on the sage will hear that thunder with glad ears.”    Venters and Bess finished their simple meal and the few tasks around the  camp, then faced the open terrace, the valley, and the west, to watch  and await the approaching storm.    It required keen vision to see any movement whatever in the purple  clouds. By infinitesimal degrees the dark cloud-line merged upward into  the golden-red haze of the afterglow of sunset. A shadow lengthened from  under the western wall across the valley. As straight and rigid as steel  rose the delicate spear-pointed silver spruces; the aspen leaves, by  nature pendant and quivering, hung limp and heavy; no slender blade  of grass moved. A gentle splashing of water came from the ravine. Then  again from out of the west sounded the low, dull, and rumbling roll of  thunder.    A wave, a ripple of light, a trembling and turning of the aspen leaves,  like the approach of a breeze on the water, crossed the valley from the  west; and the lull and the deadly stillness and the sultry air passed  away on a cool wind.    The night bird of the canyon, with clear and melancholy notes announced  the twilight. And from all along the cliffs rose the faint murmur and  moan and mourn of the wind singing in the caves. The bank of clouds now  swept hugely out of the western sky. Its front was purple and black,  with gray between, a bulging, mushrooming, vast thing instinct with  storm. It had a dark, angry, threatening aspect. As if all the power of  the winds were pushing and piling behind, it rolled ponderously across  the sky. A red flare burned out instantaneously, flashed from the west  to east, and died. Then from the deepest black of the purple cloud burst  a boom. It was like the bowling of a huge boulder along the crags and  ramparts, and seemed to roll on and fall into the valley to bound and  bang and boom from cliff to cliff.    “Oh!” cried Bess, with her hands over her ears. “What did I tell you?”    “Why, Bess, be reasonable!” said Venters.    “I'm a coward.”    “Not quite that, I hope. It's strange you're afraid. I love a storm.”    “I tell you a storm down in these canyons is an awful thing. I know  Oldring hated storms. His men were afraid of them. There was one who  went deaf in a bad storm, and never could hear again.”    “Maybe I've lots to learn, Bess. I'll lose my guess if this storm isn't  bad enough. We're going to have heavy wind first, then lightning and  thunder, then the rain. Let's stay out as long as we can.”    The tips of the cottonwoods and the oaks waved to the east, and the  rings of aspens along the terraces twinkled their myriad of bright faces  in fleet and glancing gleam. A low roar rose from the leaves of the  forest, and the spruces swished in the rising wind. It came in gusts,  with light breezes between. As it increased in strength the lulls  shortened in length till there was a strong and steady blow all the  time, and violent puffs at intervals, and sudden whirling currents. The  clouds spread over the valley, rolling swiftly and low, and twilight  faded into a sweeping darkness. Then the singing of the wind in the  caves drowned the swift roar of rustling leaves; then the song swelled  to a mourning, moaning wail; then with the gathering power of the  wind the wail changed to a shriek. Steadily the wind strengthened and  constantly the strange sound changed.    The last bit of blue sky yielded to the on-sweep of clouds. Like angry  surf the pale gleams of gray, amid the purple of that scudding front,  swept beyond the eastern rampart of the valley. The purple deepened to  black. Broad sheets of lightning flared over the western wall. There  were not yet any ropes or zigzag streaks darting down through the  gathering darkness. The storm center was still beyond Surprise Valley.    “Listen!... Listen!” cried Bess, with her lips close to Venters's ear.  “You'll hear Oldring's knell!”    “What's that?”    “Oldring's knell. When the wind blows a gale in the caves it makes what  the rustlers call Oldring's knell. They believe it bodes his death.  I think he believes so, too. It's not like any sound on earth.... It's  beginning. Listen!”    The gale swooped down with a hollow unearthly howl. It yelled and pealed  and shrilled and shrieked. It was made up of a thousand piercing cries.  It was a rising and a moving sound. Beginning at the western break of  the valley, it rushed along each gigantic cliff, whistling into the  caves and cracks, to mount in power, to bellow a blast through the great  stone bridge. Gone, as into an engulfing roar of surging waters, it  seemed to shoot back and begin all over again.    It was only wind, thought Venters. Here sped and shrieked the sculptor  that carved out the wonderful caves in the cliffs. It was only a gale,  but as Venters listened, as his ears became accustomed to the fury and  strife, out of it all or through it or above it pealed low and perfectly  clear and persistently uniform a strange sound that had no counterpart  in all the sounds of the elements. It was not of earth or of life. It  was the grief and agony of the gale. A knell of all upon which it blew!    Black night enfolded the valley. Venters could not see his companion,  and knew of her presence only through the tightening hold of her hand  on his arm. He felt the dogs huddle closer to him. Suddenly the dense,  black vault overhead split asunder to a blue-white, dazzling streak of  lightning. The whole valley lay vividly clear and luminously bright in  his sight. Upreared, vast and magnificent, the stone bridge glimmered  like some grand god of storm in the lightning's fire. Then all flashed  black again--blacker than pitch--a thick, impenetrable coal-blackness.  And there came a ripping, crashing report. Instantly an echo resounded  with clapping crash. The initial report was nothing to the echo. It was  a terrible, living, reverberating, detonating crash. The wall threw the  sound across, and could have made no greater roar if it had slipped  in avalanche. From cliff to cliff the echo went in crashing retort and  banged in lessening power, and boomed in thinner volume, and clapped  weaker and weaker till a final clap could not reach across the waiting  cliff.    In the pitchy darkness Venters led Bess, and, groping his way, by feel  of hand found the entrance to her cave and lifted her up. On the instant  a blinding flash of lightning illumined the cave and all about him. He  saw Bess's face white now with dark, frightened eyes. He saw the dogs  leap up, and he followed suit. The golden glare vanished; all was black;  then came the splitting crack and the infernal din of echoes.    Bess shrank closer to him and closer, found his hands, and pressed them  tightly over her ears, and dropped her face upon his shoulder, and hid  her eyes.    Then the storm burst with a succession of ropes and streaks and shafts  of lightning, playing continuously, filling the valley with a broken  radiance; and the cracking shots followed each other swiftly till the  echoes blended in one fearful, deafening crash.    Venters looked out upon the beautiful valley--beautiful now as never  before--mystic in its transparent, luminous gloom, weird in the  quivering, golden haze of lightning. The dark spruces were tipped with  glimmering lights; the aspens bent low in the winds, as waves in a  tempest at sea; the forest of oaks tossed wildly and shone with gleams  of fire. Across the valley the huge cavern of the cliff-dwellers yawned  in the glare, every little black window as clear as at noonday; but the  night and the storm added to their tragedy. Flung arching to the black  clouds, the great stone bridge seemed to bear the brunt of the storm. It  caught the full fury of the rushing wind. It lifted its noble crown to  meet the lightnings. Venters thought of the eagles and their lofty nest  in a niche under the arch. A driving pall of rain, black as the clouds,  came sweeping on to obscure the bridge and the gleaming walls and the  shining valley. The lightning played incessantly, streaking down through  opaque darkness of rain. The roar of the wind, with its strange knell  and the re-crashing echoes, mingled with the roar of the flooding rain,  and all seemingly were deadened and drowned in a world of sound.    In the dimming pale light Venters looked down upon the girl. She had  sunk into his arms, upon his breast, burying her face. She clung to him.  He felt the softness of her, and the warmth, and the quick heave of her  breast. He saw the dark, slender, graceful outline of her form. A woman  lay in his arms! And he held her closer. He who had been alone in the  sad, silent watches of the night was not now and never must be again  alone. He who had yearned for the touch of a hand felt the long tremble  and the heart-beat of a woman. By what strange chance had she come to  love him! By what change--by what marvel had she grown into a treasure!    No more did he listen to the rush and roar of the thunder-storm.  For with the touch of clinging hands and the throbbing bosom he grew  conscious of an inward storm--the tingling of new chords of thought,  strange music of unheard, joyous bells sad dreams dawning to wakeful  delight, dissolving doubt, resurging hope, force, fire, and freedom,  unutterable sweetness of desire. A storm in his breast--a storm of real  love.        CHAPTER XIV. WEST WIND    When the storm abated Venters sought his own cave, and late in the  night, as his blood cooled and the stir and throb and thrill subsided,  he fell asleep.    With the breaking of dawn his eyes unclosed. The valley lay drenched  and bathed, a burnished oval of glittering green. The rain-washed walls  glistened in the morning light. Waterfalls of many forms poured over  the rims. One, a broad, lacy sheet, thin as smoke, slid over the western  notch and struck a ledge in its downward fall, to bound into broader  leap, to burst far below into white and gold and rosy mist.    Venters prepared for the day, knowing himself a different man.    “It's a glorious morning,” said Bess, in greeting.    “Yes. After the storm the west wind,” he replied.    “Last night was I--very much of a baby?” she asked, watching him.    “Pretty much.”    “Oh, I couldn't help it!”    “I'm glad you were afraid.”    “Why?” she asked, in slow surprise.    “I'll tell you some day,” he answered, soberly. Then around the  camp-fire and through the morning meal he was silent; afterward he  strolled thoughtfully off alone along the terrace. He climbed a great  yellow rock raising its crest among the spruces, and there he sat down  to face the valley and the west.    “I love her!”    Aloud he spoke--unburdened his heart--confessed his secret. For an  instant the golden valley swam before his eyes, and the walls waved, and  all about him whirled with tumult within.    “I love her!... I understand now.”    Reviving memory of Jane Withersteen and thought of the complications of  the present amazed him with proof of how far he had drifted from his  old life. He discovered that he hated to take up the broken threads, to  delve into dark problems and difficulties. In this beautiful valley he  had been living a beautiful dream. Tranquillity had come to him, and the  joy of solitude, and interest in all the wild creatures and crannies of  this incomparable valley--and love. Under the shadow of the great stone  bridge God had revealed Himself to Venters.    “The world seems very far away,” he muttered, “but it's there--and I'm  not yet done with it. Perhaps I never shall be.... Only--how glorious it  would be to live here always and never think again!”    Whereupon the resurging reality of the present, as if in irony of his  wish, steeped him instantly in contending thought. Out of it all he  presently evolved these things: he must go to Cottonwoods; he must bring  supplies back to Surprise Valley; he must cultivate the soil and raise  corn and stock, and, most imperative of all, he must decide the future  of the girl who loved him and whom he loved. The first of these things  required tremendous effort, the last one, concerning Bess, seemed simply  and naturally easy of accomplishment. He would marry her. Suddenly, as  from roots of poisonous fire, flamed up the forgotten truth concerning  her. It seemed to wither and shrivel up all his joy on its hot, tearing  way to his heart. She had been Oldring's Masked Rider. To Venters's  question, “What were you to Oldring?” she had answered with scarlet  shame and drooping head.    “What do I care who she is or what she was!” he cried, passionately. And  he knew it was not his old self speaking. It was this softer, gentler  man who had awakened to new thoughts in the quiet valley. Tenderness,  masterful in him now, matched the absence of joy and blunted the  knife-edge of entering jealousy. Strong and passionate effort of will,  surprising to him, held back the poison from piercing his soul.    “Wait!... Wait!” he cried, as if calling. His hand pressed his breast,  and he might have called to the pang there. “Wait! It's all so  strange--so wonderful. Anything can happen. Who am I to judge her? I'll  glory in my love for her. But I can't tell it--can't give up to it.”    Certainly he could not then decide her future. Marrying her was  impossible in Surprise Valley and in any village south of Sterling. Even  without the mask she had once worn she would easily have been recognized  as Oldring's Rider. No man who had ever seen her would forget her,  regardless of his ignorance as to her sex. Then more poignant than all  other argument was the fact that he did not want to take her away from  Surprise Valley. He resisted all thought of that. He had brought her to  the most beautiful and wildest place of the uplands; he had saved her,  nursed her back to strength, watched her bloom as one of the valley  lilies; he knew her life there to be pure and sweet--she belonged to  him, and he loved her. Still these were not all the reasons why he  did not want to take her away. Where could they go? He feared the  rustlers--he feared the riders--he feared the Mormons. And if he should  ever succeed in getting Bess safely away from these immediate perils, he  feared the sharp eyes of women and their tongues, the big outside world  with its problems of existence. He must wait to decide her future,  which, after all, was deciding his own. But between her future and his  something hung impending. Like Balancing Rock, which waited darkly over  the steep gorge, ready to close forever the outlet to Deception Pass,  that nameless thing, as certain yet intangible as fate, must fall and  close forever all doubts and fears of the future.    “I've dreamed,” muttered Venters, as he rose. “Well, why not?... To dream  is happiness! But let me just once see this clearly wholly; then I can  go on dreaming till the thing falls. I've got to tell Jane Withersteen.  I've dangerous trips to take. I've work here to make comfort for this  girl. She's mine. I'll fight to keep her safe from that old life. I've  already seen her forget it. I love her. And if a beast ever rises in me  I'll burn my hand off before I lay it on her with shameful intent. And,  by God! sooner or later I'll kill the man who hid her and kept her in  Deception Pass!”    As he spoke the west wind softly blew in his face. It seemed to soothe  his passion. That west wind was fresh, cool, fragrant, and it carried  a sweet, strange burden of far-off things--tidings of life in other  climes, of sunshine asleep on other walls--of other places where reigned  peace. It carried, too, sad truth of human hearts and mystery--of  promise and hope unquenchable. Surprise Valley was only a little niche  in the wide world whence blew that burdened wind. Bess was only one of  millions at the mercy of unknown motive in nature and life. Content had  come to Venters in the valley; happiness had breathed in the slow, warm  air; love as bright as light had hovered over the walls and descended to  him; and now on the west wind came a whisper of the eternal triumph of  faith over doubt.    “How much better I am for what has come to me!” he exclaimed. “I'll let  the future take care of itself. Whatever falls, I'll be ready.”    Venters retraced his steps along the terrace back to camp, and found  Bess in the old familiar seat, waiting and watching for his return.    “I went off by myself to think a little,” he explained.    “You never looked that way before. What--what is it? Won't you tell me?”    “Well, Bess, the fact is I've been dreaming a lot. This valley makes a  fellow dream. So I forced myself to think. We can't live this way much  longer. Soon I'll simply have to go to Cottonwoods. We need a whole pack  train of supplies. I can get--”    “Can you go safely?” she interrupted.    “Why, I'm sure of it. I'll ride through the Pass at night. I haven't any  fear that Wrangle isn't where I left him. And once on him--Bess, just  wait till you see that horse!”    “Oh, I want to see him--to ride him. But--but, Bern, this is what  troubles me,” she said. “Will--will you come back?”    “Give me four days. If I'm not back in four days you'll know I'm dead.  For that only shall keep me.”    “Oh!”    “Bess, I'll come back. There's danger--I wouldn't lie to you--but I can  take care of myself.”    “Bern, I'm sure--oh, I'm sure of it! All my life I've watched hunted  men. I can tell what's in them. And I believe you can ride and shoot and  see with any rider of the sage. It's not--not that I--fear.”    “Well, what is it, then?”    “Why--why--why should you come back at all?”    “I couldn't leave you here alone.”    “You might change your mind when you get to the village--among old  friends--”    “I won't change my mind. As for old friends--” He uttered a short,  expressive laugh.    “Then--there--there must be a--a woman!” Dark red mantled the clear tan  of temple and cheek and neck. Her eyes were eyes of shame, upheld a long  moment by intense, straining search for the verification of her fear.  Suddenly they drooped, her head fell to her knees, her hands flew to her  hot cheeks.    “Bess--look here,” said Venters, with a sharpness due to the violence  with which he checked his quick, surging emotion.    As if compelled against her will--answering to an irresistible  voice--Bess raised her head, looked at him with sad, dark eyes, and  tried to whisper with tremulous lips.    “There's no woman,” went on Venters, deliberately holding her glance  with his. “Nothing on earth, barring the chances of life, can keep me  away.”    Her face flashed and flushed with the glow of a leaping joy; but like  the vanishing of a gleam it disappeared to leave her as he had never  beheld her.    “I am nothing--I am lost--I am nameless!”    “Do you want me to come back?” he asked, with sudden stern coldness.  “Maybe you want to go back to Oldring!”    That brought her erect, trembling and ashy pale, with dark, proud eyes  and mute lips refuting his insinuation.    “Bess, I beg your pardon. I shouldn't have said that. But you angered  me. I intend to work--to make a home for you here--to be a--a brother  to you as long as ever you need me. And you must forget what you  are--were--I mean, and be happy. When you remember that old life you are  bitter, and it hurts me.”    “I was happy--I shall be very happy. Oh, you're so good that--that it  kills me! If I think, I can't believe it. I grow sick with wondering  why. I'm only a let me say it--only a lost, nameless--girl of the  rustlers. Oldring's Girl, they called me. That you should save me--be so  good and kind--want to make me happy--why, it's beyond belief. No wonder  I'm wretched at the thought of your leaving me. But I'll be wretched  and bitter no more. I promise you. If only I could repay you even a  little--”    “You've repaid me a hundredfold. Will you believe me?”    “Believe you! I couldn't do else.”    “Then listen!... Saving you, I saved myself. Living here in this valley  with you, I've found myself. I've learned to think while I was dreaming.  I never troubled myself about God. But God, or some wonderful spirit,  has whispered to me here. I absolutely deny the truth of what you say  about yourself. I can't explain it. There are things too deep to tell.  Whatever the terrible wrongs you've suffered, God holds you blameless.  I see that--feel that in you every moment you are near me. I've a  mother and a sister 'way back in Illinois. If I could I'd take you to  them--to-morrow.”    “If it were true! Oh, I might--I might lift my head!” she cried.    “Lift it then--you child. For I swear it's true.”    She did lift her head with the singular wild grace always a part of her  actions, with that old unconscious intimation of innocence which always  tortured Venters, but now with something more--a spirit rising from the  depths that linked itself to his brave words.    “I've been thinking--too,” she cried, with quivering smile and swelling  breast. “I've discovered myself--too. I'm young--I'm alive--I'm so  full--oh! I'm a woman!”    “Bess, I believe I can claim credit of that last discovery--before you,”   Venters said, and laughed.    “Oh, there's more--there's something I must tell you.”    “Tell it, then.”    “When will you go to Cottonwoods?”    “As soon as the storms are past, or the worst of them.”    “I'll tell you before you go. I can't now. I don't know how I shall  then. But it must be told. I'd never let you leave me without knowing.  For in spite of what you say there's a chance you mightn't come back.”    Day after day the west wind blew across the valley. Day after day the  clouds clustered gray and purple and black. The cliffs sang and the  caves rang with Oldring's knell, and the lightning flashed, the thunder  rolled, the echoes crashed and crashed, and the rains flooded the  valley. Wild flowers sprang up everywhere, swaying with the lengthening  grass on the terraces, smiling wanly from shady nooks, peeping  wondrously from year-dry crevices of the walls. The valley bloomed  into a paradise. Every single moment, from the breaking of the gold bar  through the bridge at dawn on to the reddening of rays over the western  wall, was one of colorful change. The valley swam in thick, transparent  haze, golden at dawn, warm and white at noon, purple in the twilight. At  the end of every storm a rainbow curved down into the leaf-bright forest  to shine and fade and leave lingeringly some faint essence of its rosy  iris in the air.    Venters walked with Bess, once more in a dream, and watched the lights  change on the walls, and faced the wind from out of the west.    Always it brought softly to him strange, sweet tidings of far-off  things. It blew from a place that was old and whispered of youth. It  blew down the grooves of time. It brought a story of the passing hours.  It breathed low of fighting men and praying women. It sang clearly the  song of love. That ever was the burden of its tidings--youth in the  shady woods, waders through the wet meadows, boy and girl at the  hedgerow stile, bathers in the booming surf, sweet, idle hours on  grassy, windy hills, long strolls down moonlit lanes--everywhere in  far-off lands, fingers locked and bursting hearts and longing lips--from  all the world tidings of unquenchable love.    Often, in these hours of dreams he watched the girl, and asked himself  of what was she dreaming? For the changing light of the valley reflected  its gleam and its color and its meaning in the changing light of her  eyes. He saw in them infinitely more than he saw in his dreams. He saw  thought and soul and nature--strong vision of life. All tidings the west  wind blew from distance and age he found deep in those dark-blue depths,  and found them mysteries solved. Under their wistful shadow he softened,  and in the softening felt himself grow a sadder, a wiser, and a better  man.    While the west wind blew its tidings, filling his heart full, teaching  him a man's part, the days passed, the purple clouds changed to white,  and the storms were over for that summer.    “I must go now,” he said.    “When?” she asked.    “At once--to-night.”    “I'm glad the time has come. It dragged at me. Go--for you'll come back  the sooner.”    Late in the afternoon, as the ruddy sun split its last flame in the  ragged notch of the western wall, Bess walked with Venters along the  eastern terrace, up the long, weathered slope, under the great stone  bridge. They entered the narrow gorge to climb around the fence long  before built there by Venters. Farther than this she had never been.  Twilight had already fallen in the gorge. It brightened to waning shadow  in the wider ascent. He showed her Balancing Rock, of which he had  often told her, and explained its sinister leaning over the outlet.  Shuddering, she looked down the long, pale incline with its closed-in,  toppling walls.    “What an awful trail! Did you carry me up here?”    “I did, surely,” replied he.    “It frightens me, somehow. Yet I never was afraid of trails. I'd ride  anywhere a horse could go, and climb where he couldn't. But there's  something fearful here. I feel as--as if the place was watching me.”    “Look at this rock. It's balanced here--balanced perfectly. You know I  told you the cliff-dwellers cut the rock, and why. But they're gone and  the rock waits. Can't you see--feel how it waits here? I moved it once,  and I'll never dare again. A strong heave would start it. Then it would  fall and bang, and smash that crag, and jar the walls, and close forever  the outlet to Deception Pass!”    “Ah! When you come back I'll steal up here and push and push with all  my might to roll the rock and close forever the outlet to the Pass!”   She said it lightly, but in the undercurrent of her voice was a heavier  note, a ring deeper than any ever given mere play of words.    “Bess!... You can't dare me! Wait till I come back with supplies--then  roll the stone.”    “I--was--in--fun.” Her voice now throbbed low. “Always you must be free  to go when you will. Go now... this place presses on me--stifles me.”    “I'm going--but you had something to tell me?”    “Yes.... Will you--come back?”    “I'll come if I live.”    “But--but you mightn't come?”    “That's possible, of course. It'll take a good deal to kill me. A man  couldn't have a faster horse or keener dog. And, Bess, I've guns, and  I'll use them if I'm pushed. But don't worry.”    “I've faith in you. I'll not worry until after four days. Only--because  you mightn't come--I must tell you--”    She lost her voice. Her pale face, her great, glowing, earnest eyes,  seemed to stand alone out of the gloom of the gorge. The dog whined,  breaking the silence.    “I must tell you--because you mightn't come back,” she whispered. “You  must know what--what I think of your goodness--of you. Always I've been  tongue-tied. I seemed not to be grateful. It was deep in my heart.  Even now--if I were other than I am--I couldn't tell you. But I'm  nothing--only a rustler's girl--nameless--infamous. You've saved me--and  I'm--I'm yours to do with as you like.... With all my heart and soul--I  love you!”        CHAPTER XV. SHADOWS ON THE SAGE-SLOPE    In the cloudy, threatening, waning summer days shadows lengthened  down the sage-slope, and Jane Withersteen likened them to the shadows  gathering and closing in around her life.    Mrs. Larkin died, and little Fay was left an orphan with no known  relative. Jane's love redoubled. It was the saving brightness of a  darkening hour. Fay turned now to Jane in childish worship. And Jane  at last found full expression for the mother-longing in her heart. Upon  Lassiter, too, Mrs. Larkin's death had some subtle reaction. Before,  he had often, without explanation, advised Jane to send Fay back to any  Gentile family that would take her in. Passionately and reproachfully  and wonderingly Jane had refused even to entertain such an idea. And  now Lassiter never advised it again, grew sadder and quieter in his  contemplation of the child, and infinitely more gentle and loving.  Sometimes Jane had a cold, inexplicable sensation of dread when she saw  Lassiter watching Fay. What did the rider see in the future? Why did he,  day by day, grow more silent, calmer, cooler, yet sadder in prophetic  assurance of something to be?    No doubt, Jane thought, the rider, in his almost superhuman power of  foresight, saw behind the horizon the dark, lengthening shadows that  were soon to crowd and gloom over him and her and little Fay. Jane  Withersteen awaited the long-deferred breaking of the storm with a  courage and embittered calm that had come to her in her extremity. Hope  had not died. Doubt and fear, subservient to her will, no longer gave  her sleepless nights and tortured days. Love remained. All that she had  loved she now loved the more. She seemed to feel that she was defiantly  flinging the wealth of her love in the face of misfortune and of  hate. No day passed but she prayed for all--and most fervently for her  enemies. It troubled her that she had lost, or had never gained,  the whole control of her mind. In some measure reason and wisdom and  decision were locked in a chamber of her brain, awaiting a key. Power  to think of some things was taken from her. Meanwhile, abiding a day of  judgment, she fought ceaselessly to deny the bitter drops in her cup,  to tear back the slow, the intangibly slow growth of a hot, corrosive  lichen eating into her heart.    On the morning of August 10th, Jane, while waiting in the court for  Lassiter, heard a clear, ringing report of a rifle. It came from the  grove, somewhere toward the corrals. Jane glanced out in alarm. The day  was dull, windless, soundless. The leaves of the cottonwoods drooped, as  if they had foretold the doom of Withersteen House and were now ready to  die and drop and decay. Never had Jane seen such shade. She pondered  on the meaning of the report. Revolver shots had of late cracked from  different parts of the grove--spies taking snap-shots at Lassiter from  a cowardly distance! But a rifle report meant more. Riders seldom used  rifles. Judkins and Venters were the exceptions she called to mind. Had  the men who hounded her hidden in her grove, taken to the rifle to rid  her of Lassiter, her last friend? It was probable--it was likely. And  she did not share his cool assumption that his death would never come at  the hands of a Mormon. Long had she expected it. His constancy to  her, his singular reluctance to use the fatal skill for which he was  famed--both now plain to all Mormons--laid him open to inevitable  assassination. Yet what charm against ambush and aim and enemy he  seemed to bear about him! No, Jane reflected, it was not charm; only  a wonderful training of eye and ear, and sense of impending peril.  Nevertheless that could not forever avail against secret attack.    That moment a rustling of leaves attracted her attention; then the  familiar clinking accompaniment of a slow, soft, measured step, and  Lassiter walked into the court.    “Jane, there's a fellow out there with a long gun,” he said, and,  removing his sombrero, showed his head bound in a bloody scarf.    “I heard the shot; I knew it was meant for you. Let me see--you can't be  badly injured?”    “I reckon not. But mebbe it wasn't a close call!... I'll sit here in this  corner where nobody can see me from the grove.” He untied the scarf and  removed it to show a long, bleeding furrow above his left temple.    “It's only a cut,” said Jane. “But how it bleeds! Hold your scarf over  it just a moment till I come back.”    She ran into the house and returned with bandages; and while she bathed  and dressed the wound Lassiter talked.    “That fellow had a good chance to get me. But he must have flinched when  he pulled the trigger. As I dodged down I saw him run through the trees.  He had a rifle. I've been expectin' that kind of gun play. I reckon now  I'll have to keep a little closer hid myself. These fellers all seem to  get chilly or shaky when they draw a bead on me, but one of them might  jest happen to hit me.”    “Won't you go away--leave Cottonwoods as I've begged you to--before some  one does happen to hit you?” she appealed to him.    “I reckon I'll stay.”    “But, oh, Lassiter--your blood will be on my hands!”    “See here, lady, look at your hands now, right now. Aren't they fine,  firm, white hands? Aren't they bloody now? Lassiter's blood! That's a  queer thing to stain your beautiful hands. But if you could only see  deeper you'd find a redder color of blood. Heart color, Jane!”    “Oh!... My friend!”    “No, Jane, I'm not one to quit when the game grows hot, no more than  you. This game, though, is new to me, an' I don't know the moves yet,  else I wouldn't have stepped in front of that bullet.”    “Have you no desire to hunt the man who fired at you--to find  him--and--and kill him?”    “Well, I reckon I haven't any great hankerin' for that.”    “Oh, the wonder of it!... I knew--I prayed--I trusted. Lassiter, I almost  gave--all myself to soften you to Mormons. Thank God, and thank you, my  friend.... But, selfish woman that I am, this is no great test. What's  the life of one of those sneaking cowards to such a man as you? I think  of your great hate toward him who--I think of your life's implacable  purpose. Can it be--”    “Wait!... Listen!” he whispered. “I hear a hoss.”    He rose noiselessly, with his ear to the breeze. Suddenly he pulled his  sombrero down over his bandaged head and, swinging his gun-sheaths round  in front, he stepped into the alcove.    “It's a hoss--comin' fast,” he added.    Jane's listening ear soon caught a faint, rapid, rhythmic beat of hoofs.  It came from the sage. It gave her a thrill that she was at a loss to  understand. The sound rose stronger, louder. Then came a clear, sharp  difference when the horse passed from the sage trail to the hard-packed  ground of the grove. It became a ringing run--swift in its bell-like  clatterings, yet singular in longer pause than usual between the  hoofbeats of a horse.    “It's Wrangle!... It's Wrangle!” cried Jane Withersteen. “I'd know him  from a million horses!”    Excitement and thrilling expectancy flooded out all Jane Withersteen's  calm. A tight band closed round her breast as she saw the giant sorrel  flit in reddish-brown flashes across the openings in the green. Then  he was pounding down the lane--thundering into the court--crashing his  great iron-shod hoofs on the stone flags. Wrangle it was surely, but  shaggy and wild-eyed, and sage-streaked, with dust-caked lather staining  his flanks. He reared and crashed down and plunged. The rider leaped  off, threw the bridle, and held hard on a lasso looped round Wrangle's  head and neck. Janet's heart sank as she tried to recognize Venters in  the rider. Something familiar struck her in the lofty stature in the  sweep of powerful shoulders. But this bearded, longhaired, unkempt man,  who wore ragged clothes patched with pieces of skin, and boots that  showed bare legs and feet--this dusty, dark, and wild rider could not  possibly be Venters.    “Whoa, Wrangle, old boy! Come down. Easy now. So--so--so. You're home,  old boy, and presently you can have a drink of water you'll remember.”    In the voice Jane knew the rider to be Venters. He tied Wrangle to the  hitching-rack and turned to the court.    “Oh, Bern!... You wild man!” she exclaimed.    “Jane--Jane, it's good to see you! Hello, Lassiter! Yes, it's Venters.”    Like rough iron his hard hand crushed Jane's. In it she felt the  difference she saw in him. Wild, rugged, unshorn--yet how splendid! He  had gone away a boy--he had returned a man. He appeared taller, wider of  shoulder, deeper-chested, more powerfully built. But was that only her  fancy--he had always been a young giant--was the change one of spirit?  He might have been absent for years, proven by fire and steel, grown  like Lassiter, strong and cool and sure. His eyes--were they keener,  more flashing than before?--met hers with clear, frank, warm regard, in  which perplexity was not, nor discontent, nor pain.    “Look at me long as you like,” he said, with a laugh. “I'm not much to  look at. And, Jane, neither you nor Lassiter, can brag. You're paler  than I ever saw you. Lassiter, here, he wears a bloody bandage under  his hat. That reminds me. Some one took a flying shot at me down in the  sage. It made Wrangle run some.... Well, perhaps you've more to tell me  than I've got to tell you.”    Briefly, in few words, Jane outlined the circumstances of her undoing in  the weeks of his absence.    Under his beard and bronze she saw his face whiten in terrible wrath.    “Lassiter--what held you back?”    No time in the long period of fiery moments and sudden shocks had Jane  Withersteen ever beheld Lassiter as calm and serene and cool as then.    “Jane had gloom enough without my addin' to it by shootin' up the  village,” he said.    As strange as Lassiter's coolness was Venters's curious, intent scrutiny  of them both, and under it Jane felt a flaming tide wave from bosom to  temples.    “Well--you're right,” he said, with slow pause. “It surprises me a  little, that's all.”    Jane sensed then a slight alteration in Venters, and what it was, in her  own confusion, she could not tell. It had always been her intention  to acquaint him with the deceit she had fallen to in her zeal to move  Lassiter. She did not mean to spare herself. Yet now, at the moment,  before these riders, it was an impossibility to explain.    Venters was speaking somewhat haltingly, without his former frankness.  “I found Oldring's hiding-place and your red herd. I learned--I  know--I'm sure there was a deal between Tull and Oldring.” He paused  and shifted his position and his gaze. He looked as if he wanted to say  something that he found beyond him. Sorrow and pity and shame seemed  to contend for mastery over him. Then he raised himself and spoke with  effort. “Jane I've cost you too much. You've almost ruined yourself  for me. It was wrong, for I'm not worth it. I never deserved such  friendship. Well, maybe it's not too late. You must give me up. Mind,  I haven't changed. I am just the same as ever. I'll see Tull while I'm  here, and tell him to his face.”    “Bern, it's too late,” said Jane.    “I'll make him believe!” cried Venters, violently.    “You ask me to break our friendship?”    “Yes. If you don't, I shall.”    “Forever?”    “Forever!”    Jane sighed. Another shadow had lengthened down the sage slope to  cast further darkness upon her. A melancholy sweetness pervaded her  resignation. The boy who had left her had returned a man, nobler,  stronger, one in whom she divined something unbending as steel. There  might come a moment later when she would wonder why she had not fought  against his will, but just now she yielded to it. She liked him as  well--nay, more, she thought, only her emotions were deadened by the  long, menacing wait for the bursting storm.    Once before she had held out her hand to him--when she gave it; now she  stretched it tremblingly forth in acceptance of the decree circumstance  had laid upon them. Venters bowed over it kissed it, pressed it hard,  and half stifled a sound very like a sob. Certain it was that when he  raised his head tears glistened in his eyes.    “Some--women--have a hard lot,” he said, huskily. Then he shook his  powerful form, and his rags lashed about him. “I'll say a few things to  Tull--when I meet him.”    “Bern--you'll not draw on Tull? Oh, that must not be! Promise me--”    “I promise you this,” he interrupted, in stern passion that thrilled  while it terrorized her. “If you say one more word for that plotter I'll  kill him as I would a mad coyote!”    Jane clasped her hands. Was this fire-eyed man the one whom she had  once made as wax to her touch? Had Venters become Lassiter and Lassiter  Venters?    “I'll--say no more,” she faltered.    “Jane, Lassiter once called you blind,” said Venters. “It must be true.  But I won't upbraid you. Only don't rouse the devil in me by praying for  Tull! I'll try to keep cool when I meet him. That's all. Now there's one  more thing I want to ask of you--the last. I've found a valley down in  the Pass. It's a wonderful place. I intend to stay there. It's so hidden  I believe no one can find it. There's good water, and browse, and game.  I want to raise corn and stock. I need to take in supplies. Will you  give them to me?”    “Assuredly. The more you take the better you'll please me--and perhaps  the less my--my enemies will get.”    “Venters, I reckon you'll have trouble packin' anythin' away,” put in  Lassiter.    “I'll go at night.”    “Mebbe that wouldn't be best. You'd sure be stopped. You'd better go  early in the mornin'--say, just after dawn. That's the safest time to  move round here.”    “Lassiter, I'll be hard to stop,” returned Venters, darkly.    “I reckon so.”    “Bern,” said Jane, “go first to the riders' quarters and get yourself a  complete outfit. You're a--a sight. Then help yourself to whatever else  you need--burros, packs, grain, dried fruits, and meat. You must take  coffee and sugar and flour--all kinds of supplies. Don't forget corn and  seeds. I remember how you used to starve. Please--please take all you  can pack away from here. I'll make a bundle for you, which you mustn't  open till you're in your valley. How I'd like to see it! To judge by you  and Wrangle, how wild it must be!”    Jane walked down into the outer court and approached the sorrel.  Upstarting, he laid back his ears and eyed her.    “Wrangle--dear old Wrangle,” she said, and put a caressing hand on his  matted mane. “Oh, he's wild, but he knows me! Bern, can he run as fast  as ever?”    “Run? Jane, he's done sixty miles since last night at dark, and I could  make him kill Black Star right now in a ten-mile race.”    “He never could,” protested Jane. “He couldn't even if he was fresh.”    “I reckon mebbe the best hoss'll prove himself yet,” said Lassiter,  “an', Jane, if it ever comes to that race I'd like you to be on  Wrangle.”    “I'd like that, too,” rejoined Venters. “But, Jane, maybe Lassiter's  hint is extreme. Bad as your prospects are, you'll surely never come to  the running point.”    “Who knows!” she replied, with mournful smile.    “No, no, Jane, it can't be so bad as all that. Soon as I see Tull  there'll be a change in your fortunes. I'll hurry down to the  village.... Now don't worry.”    Jane retired to the seclusion of her room. Lassiter's subtle forecasting  of disaster, Venters's forced optimism, neither remained in mind.  Material loss weighed nothing in the balance with other losses she  was sustaining. She wondered dully at her sitting there, hands folded  listlessly, with a kind of numb deadness to the passing of time and the  passing of her riches. She thought of Venters's friendship. She had not  lost that, but she had lost him. Lassiter's friendship--that was more  than love--it would endure, but soon he, too, would be gone. Little  Fay slept dreamlessly upon the bed, her golden curls streaming over the  pillow. Jane had the child's worship. Would she lose that, too? And if  she did, what then would be left? Conscience thundered at her that there  was left her religion. Conscience thundered that she should be grateful  on her knees for this baptism of fire; that through misfortune,  sacrifice, and suffering her soul might be fused pure gold. But the old,  spontaneous, rapturous spirit no more exalted her. She wanted to be a  woman--not a martyr. Like the saint of old who mortified his flesh,  Jane Withersteen had in her the temper for heroic martyrdom, if by  sacrificing herself she could save the souls of others. But here the  damnable verdict blistered her that the more she sacrificed herself the  blacker grew the souls of her churchmen. There was something terribly  wrong with her soul, something terribly wrong with her churchmen and her  religion. In the whirling gulf of her thought there was yet one shining  light to guide her, to sustain her in her hope; and it was that, despite  her errors and her frailties and her blindness, she had one absolute and  unfaltering hold on ultimate and supreme justice. That was love. “Love  your enemies as yourself!” was a divine word, entirely free from any  church or creed.    Jane's meditations were disturbed by Lassiter's soft, tinkling step in  the court. Always he wore the clinking spurs. Always he was in readiness  to ride. She passed out and called him into the huge, dim hall.    “I think you'll be safer here. The court is too open,” she said.    “I reckon,” replied Lassiter. “An' it's cooler here. The day's sure  muggy. Well, I went down to the village with Venters.”    “Already! Where is he?” queried Jane, in quick amaze.    “He's at the corrals. Blake's helpin' him get the burros an' packs  ready. That Blake is a good fellow.”    “Did--did Bern meet Tull?”    “I guess he did,” answered Lassiter, and he laughed dryly.    “Tell me! Oh, you exasperate me! You're so cool, so calm! For Heaven's  sake, tell me what happened!”    “First time I've been in the village for weeks,” went on Lassiter,  mildly. “I reckon there 'ain't been more of a show for a long time. Me  an' Venters walkin' down the road! It was funny. I ain't sayin' anybody  was particular glad to see us. I'm not much thought of hereabouts, an'  Venters he sure looks like what you called him, a wild man. Well, there  was some runnin' of folks before we got to the stores. Then everybody  vamoosed except some surprised rustlers in front of a saloon. Venters  went right in the stores an' saloons, an' of course I went along. I  don't know which tickled me the most--the actions of many fellers we  met, or Venters's nerve. Jane, I was downright glad to be along. You  see that sort of thing is my element, an' I've been away from it for  a spell. But we didn't find Tull in one of them places. Some Gentile  feller at last told Venters he'd find Tull in that long buildin' next to  Parsons's store. It's a kind of meetin'-room; and sure enough, when we  peeped in, it was half full of men.    “Venters yelled: 'Don't anybody pull guns! We ain't come for that!' Then  he tramped in, an' I was some put to keep alongside him. There was a  hard, scrapin' sound of feet, a loud cry, an' then some whisperin', an'  after that stillness you could cut with a knife. Tull was there,  an' that fat party who once tried to throw a gun on me, an' other  important-lookin' men, en' that little frog-legged feller who was with  Tull the day I rode in here. I wish you could have seen their faces,  'specially Tull's an' the fat party's. But there ain't no use of me  tryin' to tell you how they looked.    “Well, Venters an' I stood there in the middle of the room with that  batch of men all in front of us, en' not a blamed one of them winked an  eyelash or moved a finger. It was natural, of course, for me to notice  many of them packed guns. That's a way of mine, first noticin' them  things. Venters spoke up, an' his voice sort of chilled an' cut, en' he  told Tull he had a few things to say.”    Here Lassiter paused while he turned his sombrero round and round, in  his familiar habit, and his eyes had the look of a man seeing over again  some thrilling spectacle, and under his red bronze there was strange  animation.    “Like a shot, then, Venters told Tull that the friendship between you  an' him was all over, an' he was leaving your place. He said you'd  both of you broken off in the hope of propitiatin' your people, but you  hadn't changed your mind otherwise, an' never would.    “Next he spoke up for you. I ain't goin' to tell you what he said.  Only--no other woman who ever lived ever had such tribute! You had a  champion, Jane, an' never fear that those thick-skulled men don't know  you now. It couldn't be otherwise. He spoke the ringin', lightnin'  truth.... Then he accused Tull of the underhand, miserable robbery of a  helpless woman. He told Tull where the red herd was, of a deal made with  Oldrin', that Jerry Card had made the deal. I thought Tull was goin' to  drop, an' that little frog-legged cuss, he looked some limp an' white.  But Venters's voice would have kept anybody's legs from bucklin'. I was  stiff myself. He went on an' called Tull--called him every bad name ever  known to a rider, an' then some. He cursed Tull. I never hear a man  get such a cursin'. He laughed in scorn at the idea of Tull bein' a  minister. He said Tull an' a few more dogs of hell builded their  empire out of the hearts of such innocent an' God-fearin' women as Jane  Withersteen. He called Tull a binder of women, a callous beast who hid  behind a mock mantle of righteousness--an' the last an' lowest coward  on the face of the earth. To prey on weak women through their  religion--that was the last unspeakable crime!    “Then he finished, an' by this time he'd almost lost his voice. But his  whisper was enough. 'Tull,' he said, 'she begged me not to draw on you  to-day. She would pray for you if you burned her at the stake.... But  listen!... I swear if you and I ever come face to face again, I'll kill  you!'    “We backed out of the door then, an' up the road. But nobody follered  us.”    Jane found herself weeping passionately. She had not been conscious of  it till Lassiter ended his story, and she experienced exquisite pain and  relief in shedding tears. Long had her eyes been dry, her grief deep;  long had her emotions been dumb. Lassiter's story put her on the rack;  the appalling nature of Venters's act and speech had no parallel as an  outrage; it was worse than bloodshed. Men like Tull had been shot, but  had one ever been so terribly denounced in public? Over-mounting her  horror, an uncontrollable, quivering passion shook her very soul. It was  sheer human glory in the deed of a fearless man. It was hot, primitive  instinct to live--to fight. It was a kind of mad joy in Venters's  chivalry. It was close to the wrath that had first shaken her in the  beginning of this war waged upon her.    “Well, well, Jane, don't take it that way,” said Lassiter, in evident  distress. “I had to tell you. There's some things a feller jest can't  keep. It's strange you give up on hearin' that, when all this long time  you've been the gamest woman I ever seen. But I don't know women. Mebbe  there's reason for you to cry. I know this--nothin' ever rang in my soul  an' so filled it as what Venters did. I'd like to have done it, but--I'm  only good for throwin' a gun, en' it seems you hate that.... Well, I'll  be goin' now.”    “Where?”    “Venters took Wrangle to the stable. The sorrel's shy a shoe, an' I've  got to help hold the big devil an' put on another.”    “Tell Bern to come for the pack I want to give him--and--and to say  good-by,” called Jane, as Lassiter went out.    Jane passed the rest of that day in a vain endeavor to decide what and  what not to put in the pack for Venters. This task was the last she  would ever perform for him, and the gifts were the last she would ever  make him. So she picked and chose and rejected, and chose again, and  often paused in sad revery, and began again, till at length she filled  the pack.    It was about sunset, and she and Fay had finished supper and were  sitting in the court, when Venters's quick steps rang on the stones.  She scarcely knew him, for he had changed the tattered garments, and  she missed the dark beard and long hair. Still he was not the Venters of  old. As he came up the steps she felt herself pointing to the pack,  and heard herself speaking words that were meaningless to her. He said  good-by; he kissed her, released her, and turned away. His tall figure  blurred in her sight, grew dim through dark, streaked vision, and then  he vanished.    Twilight fell around Withersteen House, and dusk and night. Little  Fay slept; but Jane lay with strained, aching eyes. She heard the wind  moaning in the cottonwoods and mice squeaking in the walls. The night  was interminably long, yet she prayed to hold back the dawn. What would  another day bring forth? The blackness of her room seemed blacker  for the sad, entering gray of morning light. She heard the chirp of  awakening birds, and fancied she caught a faint clatter of hoofs. Then  low, dull distant, throbbed a heavy gunshot. She had expected it, was  waiting for it; nevertheless, an electric shock checked her heart, froze  the very living fiber of her bones. That vise-like hold on her faculties  apparently did not relax for a long time, and it was a voice under her  window that released her.    “Jane!... Jane!” softly called Lassiter.    She answered somehow.    “It's all right. Venters got away. I thought mebbe you'd heard that  shot, en' I was worried some.”    “What was it--who fired?”    “Well--some fool feller tried to stop Venters out there in the sage--an'  he only stopped lead!... I think it'll be all right. I haven't seen or  heard of any other fellers round. Venters'll go through safe. An', Jane,  I've got Bells saddled, an' I'm going to trail Venters. Mind, I won't  show myself unless he falls foul of somebody an' needs me. I want to see  if this place where he's goin' is safe for him. He says nobody can track  him there. I never seen the place yet I couldn't track a man to. Now,  Jane, you stay indoors while I'm gone, an' keep close watch on Fay. Will  you?”    “Yes! Oh yes!”    “An' another thing, Jane,” he continued, then paused for long--“another  thing--if you ain't here when I come back--if you're gone--don't fear,  I'll trail you--I'll find you out.”    “My dear Lassiter, where could I be gone--as you put it?” asked Jane, in  curious surprise.    “I reckon you might be somewhere. Mebbe tied in an old barn--or  corralled in some gulch--or chained in a cave! Milly Erne was--till she  give in! Mebbe that's news to you.... Well, if you're gone I'll hunt for  you.”    “No, Lassiter,” she replied, sadly and low. “If I'm gone just forget the  unhappy woman whose blinded selfish deceit you repaid with kindness and  love.”    She heard a deep, muttering curse, under his breath, and then the  silvery tinkling of his spurs as he moved away.    Jane entered upon the duties of that day with a settled, gloomy calm.  Disaster hung in the dark clouds, in the shade, in the humid west wind.  Blake, when he reported, appeared without his usual cheer; and Jerd  wore a harassed look of a worn and worried man. And when Judkins put  in appearance, riding a lame horse, and dismounted with the cramp of  a rider, his dust-covered figure and his darkly grim, almost dazed  expression told Jane of dire calamity. She had no need of words.    “Miss Withersteen, I have to report--loss of the--white herd,” said  Judkins, hoarsely.    “Come, sit down, you look played out,” replied Jane, solicitously. She  brought him brandy and food, and while he partook of refreshments, of  which he appeared badly in need, she asked no questions.    “No one rider--could hev done more--Miss Withersteen,” he went on,  presently.    “Judkins, don't be distressed. You've done more than any other rider.  I've long expected to lose the white herd. It's no surprise. It's  in line with other things that are happening. I'm grateful for your  service.”    “Miss Withersteen, I knew how you'd take it. But if anythin', that makes  it harder to tell. You see, a feller wants to do so much fer you, an'  I'd got fond of my job. We led the herd a ways off to the north of  the break in the valley. There was a big level an' pools of water an'  tip-top browse. But the cattle was in a high nervous condition. Wild--as  wild as antelope! You see, they'd been so scared they never slept. I  ain't a-goin' to tell you of the many tricks that were pulled off out  there in the sage. But there wasn't a day for weeks thet the herd didn't  get started to run. We allus managed to ride 'em close an' drive 'em  back an' keep 'em bunched. Honest, Miss Withersteen, them steers was  thin. They was thin when water and grass was everywhere. Thin at this  season--thet'll tell you how your steers was pestered. Fer instance, one  night a strange runnin' streak of fire run right through the herd. That  streak was a coyote--with an oiled an' blazin' tail! Fer I shot it an'  found out. We had hell with the herd that night, an' if the sage an'  grass hadn't been wet--we, hosses, steers, an' all would hev burned up.  But I said I wasn't goin' to tell you any of the tricks.... Strange  now, Miss Withersteen, when the stampede did come it was from natural  cause--jest a whirlin' devil of dust. You've seen the like often. An'  this wasn't no big whirl, fer the dust was mostly settled. It had dried  out in a little swale, an' ordinarily no steer would ever hev run fer  it. But the herd was nervous en' wild. An' jest as Lassiter said, when  that bunch of white steers got to movin' they was as bad as buffalo.  I've seen some buffalo stampedes back in Nebraska, an' this bolt of the  steers was the same kind.    “I tried to mill the herd jest as Lassiter did. But I wasn't equal to  it, Miss Withersteen. I don't believe the rider lives who could hev  turned thet herd. We kept along of the herd fer miles, an' more 'n one  of my boys tried to get the steers a-millin'. It wasn't no use. We got  off level ground, goin' down, an' then the steers ran somethin' fierce.  We left the little gullies an' washes level-full of dead steers. Finally  I saw the herd was makin' to pass a kind of low pocket between ridges.  There was a hog-back--as we used to call 'em--a pile of rocks stickin'  up, and I saw the herd was goin' to split round it, or swing out to the  left. An' I wanted 'em to go to the right so mebbe we'd be able to drive  'em into the pocket. So, with all my boys except three, I rode hard to  turn the herd a little to the right. We couldn't budge 'em. They went on  en' split round the rocks, en' the most of 'em was turned sharp to the  left by a deep wash we hedn't seen--hed no chance to see.    “The other three boys--Jimmy Vail, Joe Willis, an' thet little Cairns  boy--a nervy kid! they, with Cairns leadin', tried to buck thet herd  round to the pocket. It was a wild, fool idee. I couldn't do nothin'.  The boys got hemmed in between the steers an' the wash--thet they hedn't  no chance to see, either. Vail an' Willis was run down right before our  eyes. An' Cairns, who rode a fine hoss, he did some ridin'. I never seen  equaled, en' would hev beat the steers if there'd been any room to run  in. I was high up an' could see how the steers kept spillin' by twos an'  threes over into the wash. Cairns put his hoss to a place thet was too  wide fer any hoss, an' broke his neck an' the hoss's too. We found that  out after, an' as fer Vail an' Willis--two thousand steers ran over the  poor boys. There wasn't much left to pack home fer burying!... An', Miss  Withersteen, thet all happened yesterday, en' I believe, if the white  herd didn't run over the wall of the Pass, it's runnin' yet.”    On the morning of the second day after Judkins's recital, during which  time Jane remained indoors a prey to regret and sorrow for the boy  riders, and a new and now strangely insistent fear for her own person,  she again heard what she had missed more than she dared honestly  confess--the soft, jingling step of Lassiter. Almost overwhelming relief  surged through her, a feeling as akin to joy as any she could have  been capable of in those gloomy hours of shadow, and one that suddenly  stunned her with the significance of what Lassiter had come to mean to  her. She had begged him, for his own sake, to leave Cottonwoods. She  might yet beg that, if her weakening courage permitted her to dare  absolute loneliness and helplessness, but she realized now that if she  were left alone her life would become one long, hideous nightmare.    When his soft steps clinked into the hall, in answer to her greeting,  and his tall, black-garbed form filled the door, she felt an  inexpressible sense of immediate safety. In his presence she lost her  fear of the dim passageways of Withersteen House and of every sound.  Always it had been that, when he entered the court or the hall, she  had experienced a distinctly sickening but gradually lessening shock  at sight of the huge black guns swinging at his sides. This time the  sickening shock again visited her, it was, however, because a revealing  flash of thought told her that it was not alone Lassiter who was  thrillingly welcome, but also his fatal weapons. They meant so much. How  she had fallen--how broken and spiritless must she be--to have still  the same old horror of Lassiter's guns and his name, yet feel somehow a  cold, shrinking protection in their law and might and use.    “Did you trail Venters--find his wonderful valley?” she asked, eagerly.    “Yes, an' I reckon it's sure a wonderful place.”    “Is he safe there?”    “That's been botherin' me some. I tracked him an' part of the trail was  the hardest I ever tackled. Mebbe there's a rustler or somebody in this  country who's as good at trackin' as I am. If that's so Venters ain't  safe.”    “Well--tell me all about Bern and his valley.”    To Jane's surprise Lassiter showed disinclination for further talk about  his trip. He appeared to be extremely fatigued. Jane reflected that  one hundred and twenty miles, with probably a great deal of climbing  on foot, all in three days, was enough to tire any rider. Moreover, it  presently developed that Lassiter had returned in a mood of singular  sadness and preoccupation. She put it down to a moodiness over the loss  of her white herd and the now precarious condition of her fortune.    Several days passed, and as nothing happened, Jane's spirits began to  brighten. Once in her musings she thought that this tendency of hers  to rebound was as sad as it was futile. Meanwhile, she had resumed her  walks through the grove with little Fay.    One morning she went as far as the sage. She had not seen the slope  since the beginning of the rains, and now it bloomed a rich deep purple.  There was a high wind blowing, and the sage tossed and waved and colored  beautifully from light to dark. Clouds scudded across the sky and their  shadows sailed darkly down the sunny slope.    Upon her return toward the house she went by the lane to the stables,  and she had scarcely entered the great open space with its corrals and  sheds when she saw Lassiter hurriedly approaching. Fay broke from her  and, running to a corral fence, began to pat and pull the long, hanging  ears of a drowsy burro.    One look at Lassiter armed her for a blow.    Without a word he led her across the wide yard to the rise of the ground  upon which the stable stood.    “Jane--look!” he said, and pointed to the ground.    Jane glanced down, and again, and upon steadier vision made out  splotches of blood on the stones, and broad, smooth marks in the dust,  leading out toward the sage.    “What made these?” she asked.    “I reckon somebody has dragged dead or wounded men out to where there  was hosses in the sage.”    “Dead--or--wounded--men!”    “I reckon--Jane, are you strong? Can you bear up?”    His hands were gently holding hers, and his eyes--suddenly she could no  longer look into them. “Strong?” she echoed, trembling. “I--I will be.”    Up on the stone-flag drive, nicked with the marks made by the iron-shod  hoofs of her racers, Lassiter led her, his grasp ever growing firmer.    “Where's Blake--and--and Jerb?” she asked, haltingly.    “I don't know where Jerb is. Bolted, most likely,” replied Lassiter, as  he took her through the stone door. “But Blake--poor Blake! He's gone  forever!... Be prepared, Jane.”    With a cold prickling of her skin, with a queer thrumming in her ears,  with fixed and staring eyes, Jane saw a gun lying at her feet with  chamber swung and empty, and discharged shells scattered near.    Outstretched upon the stable floor lay Blake, ghastly white--dead--one  hand clutching a gun and the other twisted in his bloody blouse.    “Whoever the thieves were, whether your people or rustlers--Blake killed  some of them!” said Lassiter.    “Thieves?” whispered Jane.    “I reckon. Hoss-thieves!... Look!” Lassiter waved his hand toward the  stalls.    The first stall--Bells's stall--was empty. All the stalls were empty. No  racer whinnied and stamped greeting to her. Night was gone! Black Star  was gone!        CHAPTER XVI. GOLD    As Lassiter had reported to Jane, Venters “went through” safely, and  after a toilsome journey reached the peaceful shelter of Surprise  Valley. When finally he lay wearily down under the silver spruces,  resting from the strain of dragging packs and burros up the slope and  through the entrance to Surprise Valley, he had leisure to think, and  a great deal of the time went in regretting that he had not been frank  with his loyal friend, Jane Withersteen.    But, he kept continually recalling, when he had stood once more face to  face with her and had been shocked at the change in her and had heard  the details of her adversity, he had not had the heart to tell her of  the closer interest which had entered his life. He had not lied; yet he  had kept silence.    Bess was in transports over the stores of supplies and the outfit he had  packed from Cottonwoods. He had certainly brought a hundred times  more than he had gone for; enough, surely, for years, perhaps to make  permanent home in the valley. He saw no reason why he need ever leave  there again.    After a day of rest he recovered his strength and shared Bess's pleasure  in rummaging over the endless packs, and began to plan for the future.  And in this planning, his trip to Cottonwoods, with its revived hate  of Tull and consequent unleashing of fierce passions, soon faded out  of mind. By slower degrees his friendship for Jane Withersteen and his  contrition drifted from the active preoccupation of his present thought  to a place in memory, with more and more infrequent recalls.    And as far as the state of his mind was concerned, upon the second day  after his return, the valley, with its golden hues and purple shades,  the speaking west wind and the cool, silent night, and Bess's watching  eyes with their wonderful light, so wrought upon Venters that he might  never have left them at all.    That very afternoon he set to work. Only one thing hindered him upon  beginning, though it in no wise checked his delight, and that in the  multiplicity of tasks planned to make a paradise out of the valley he  could not choose the one with which to begin. He had to grow into the  habit of passing from one dreamy pleasure to another, like a bee going  from flower to flower in the valley, and he found this wandering habit  likely to extend to his labors. Nevertheless, he made a start.    At the outset he discovered Bess to be both a considerable help in some  ways and a very great hindrance in others. Her excitement and joy were  spurs, inspirations; but she was utterly impracticable in her ideas,  and she flitted from one plan to another with bewildering vacillation.  Moreover, he fancied that she grew more eager, youthful, and sweet; and  he marked that it was far easier to watch her and listen to her than  it was to work. Therefore he gave her tasks that necessitated her going  often to the cave where he had stored his packs.    Upon the last of these trips, when he was some distance down the terrace  and out of sight of camp, he heard a scream, and then the sharp barking  of the dogs.    For an instant he straightened up, amazed. Danger for her had been  absolutely out of his mind. She had seen a rattlesnake--or a wildcat.  Still she would not have been likely to scream at sight of either; and  the barking of the dogs was ominous. Dropping his work, he dashed back  along the terrace. Upon breaking through a clump of aspens he saw the  dark form of a man in the camp. Cold, then hot, Venters burst into  frenzied speed to reach his guns. He was cursing himself for a  thoughtless fool when the man's tall form became familiar and he  recognized Lassiter. Then the reversal of emotions changed his run to  a walk; he tried to call out, but his voice refused to carry; when he  reached camp there was Lassiter staring at the white-faced girl. By that  time Ring and Whitie had recognized him.    “Hello, Venters! I'm makin' you a visit,” said Lassiter, slowly. “An'  I'm some surprised to see you've a--a young feller for company.”    One glance had sufficed for the keen rider to read Bess's real sex, and  for once his cool calm had deserted him. He stared till the white of  Bess's cheeks flared into crimson. That, if it were needed, was the  concluding evidence of her femininity, for it went fittingly with her  sun-tinted hair and darkened, dilated eyes, the sweetness of her mouth,  and the striking symmetry of her slender shape.    “Heavens! Lassiter!” panted Venters, when he caught his breath. “What  relief--it's only you! How--in the name of all that's wonderful--did you  ever get here?”    “I trailed you. We--I wanted to know where you was, if you had a safe  place. So I trailed you.”    “Trailed me,” cried Venters, bluntly.    “I reckon. It was some of a job after I got to them smooth rocks. I was  all day trackin' you up to them little cut steps in the rock. The rest  was easy.”    “Where's your hoss? I hope you hid him.”    “I tied him in them queer cedars down on the slope. He can't be seen  from the valley.”    “That's good. Well, well! I'm completely dumfounded. It was my idea that  no man could track me in here.”    “I reckon. But if there's a tracker in these uplands as good as me he  can find you.”    “That's bad. That'll worry me. But, Lassiter, now you're here I'm glad  to see you. And--and my companion here is not a young fellow!... Bess,  this is a friend of mine. He saved my life once.”    The embarrassment of the moment did not extend to Lassiter. Almost at  once his manner, as he shook hands with Bess, relieved Venters and put  the girl at ease. After Venters's words and one quick look at Lassiter,  her agitation stilled, and, though she was shy, if she were conscious  of anything out of the ordinary in the situation, certainly she did not  show it.    “I reckon I'll only stay a little while,” Lassiter was saying. “An' if  you don't mind troublin', I'm hungry. I fetched some biscuits along, but  they're gone. Venters, this place is sure the wonderfullest ever seen.  Them cut steps on the slope! That outlet into the gorge! An' it's like  climbin' up through hell into heaven to climb through that gorge into  this valley! There's a queer-lookin' rock at the top of the passage. I  didn't have time to stop. I'm wonderin' how you ever found this place.  It's sure interestin'.”    During the preparation and eating of dinner Lassiter listened mostly,  as was his wont, and occasionally he spoke in his quaint and dry way.  Venters noted, however, that the rider showed an increasing interest in  Bess. He asked her no questions, and only directed his attention to her  while she was occupied and had no opportunity to observe his scrutiny.  It seemed to Venters that Lassiter grew more and more absorbed in his  study of Bess, and that he lost his coolness in some strange, softening  sympathy. Then, quite abruptly, he arose and announced the necessity  for his early departure. He said good-by to Bess in a voice gentle and  somewhat broken, and turned hurriedly away. Venters accompanied him, and  they had traversed the terrace, climbed the weathered slope, and passed  under the stone bridge before either spoke again.    Then Lassiter put a great hand on Venters's shoulder and wheeled him to  meet a smoldering fire of gray eyes.    “Lassiter, I couldn't tell Jane! I couldn't,” burst out Venters, reading  his friend's mind. “I tried. But I couldn't. She wouldn't understand,  and she has troubles enough. And I love the girl!”    “Venters, I reckon this beats me. I've seen some queer things in my  time, too. This girl--who is she?”    “I don't know.”    “Don't know! What is she, then?”    “I don't know that, either. Oh, it's the strangest story you ever heard.  I must tell you. But you'll never believe.”    “Venters, women were always puzzles to me. But for all that, if this  girl ain't a child, an' as innocent, I'm no fit person to think of  virtue an' goodness in anybody. Are you goin' to be square with her?”    “I am--so help me God!”    “I reckoned so. Mebbe my temper oughtn't led me to make sure. But, man,  she's a woman in all but years. She's sweeter 'n the sage.”    “Lassiter, I know, I know. And the hell of it is that in spite of her  innocence and charm she's--she's not what she seems!”    “I wouldn't want to--of course, I couldn't call you a liar, Venters,”   said the older man.    “What's more, she was Oldring's Masked Rider!”    Venters expected to floor his friend with that statement, but he was not  in any way prepared for the shock his words gave. For an instant he was  astounded to see Lassiter stunned; then his own passionate eagerness  to unbosom himself, to tell the wonderful story, precluded any other  thought.    “Son, tell me all about this,” presently said Lassiter as he seated  himself on a stone and wiped his moist brow.    Thereupon Venters began his narrative at the point where he had shot the  rustler and Oldring's Masked Rider, and he rushed through it, telling  all, not holding back even Bess's unreserved avowal of her love or his  deepest emotions.    “That's the story,” he said, concluding. “I love her, though I've never  told her. If I did tell her I'd be ready to marry her, and that seems  impossible in this country. I'd be afraid to risk taking her anywhere.  So I intend to do the best I can for her here.”    “The longer I live the stranger life is,” mused Lassiter, with downcast  eyes. “I'm reminded of somethin' you once said to Jane about hands in  her game of life. There's that unseen hand of power, an' Tull's black  hand, an' my red one, an' your indifferent one, an' the girl's little  brown, helpless one. An', Venters there's another one that's all-wise  an' all-wonderful. That's the hand guidin' Jane Withersteen's game of  life!... Your story's one to daze a far clearer head than mine. I can't  offer no advice, even if you asked for it. Mebbe I can help you. Anyway,  I'll hold Oldrin' up when he comes to the village an' find out about  this girl. I knew the rustler years ago. He'll remember me.”    “Lassiter, if I ever meet Oldring I'll kill him!” cried Venters, with  sudden intensity.    “I reckon that'd be perfectly natural,” replied the rider.    “Make him think Bess is dead--as she is to him and that old life.”    “Sure, sure, son. Cool down now. If you're goin' to begin pullin' guns  on Tull an' Oldin' you want to be cool. I reckon, though, you'd better  keep hid here. Well, I must be leavin'.”    “One thing, Lassiter. You'll not tell Jane about Bess? Please don't!”    “I reckon not. But I wouldn't be afraid to bet that after she'd got  over anger at your secrecy--Venters, she'd be furious once in her  life!--she'd think more of you. I don't mind sayin' for myself that I  think you're a good deal of a man.”    In the further ascent Venters halted several times with the intention of  saying good-by, yet he changed his mind and kept on climbing till they  reached Balancing Rock. Lassiter examined the huge rock, listened to  Venters's idea of its position and suggestion, and curiously placed a  strong hand upon it.    “Hold on!” cried Venters. “I heaved at it once and have never gotten  over my scare.”    “Well, you do seem uncommon nervous,” replied Lassiter, much amused.  “Now, as for me, why I always had the funniest notion to roll stones!  When I was a kid I did it, an' the bigger I got the bigger stones I'd  roll. Ain't that funny? Honest--even now I often get off my hoss just to  tumble a big stone over a precipice, en' watch it drop, en' listen to it  bang an' boom. I've started some slides in my time, an' don't you forget  it. I never seen a rock I wanted to roll as bad as this one! Wouldn't  there jest be roarin', crashin' hell down that trail?”    “You'd close the outlet forever!” exclaimed Venters. “Well, good-by,  Lassiter. Keep my secret and don't forget me. And be mighty careful how  you get out of the valley below. The rustlers' canyon isn't more than  three miles up the Pass. Now you've tracked me here, I'll never feel  safe again.”    In his descent to the valley, Venters's emotion, roused to stirring  pitch by the recital of his love story, quieted gradually, and in its  place came a sober, thoughtful mood. All at once he saw that he was  serious, because he would never more regain his sense of security while  in the valley. What Lassiter could do another skilful tracker might  duplicate. Among the many riders with whom Venters had ridden he  recalled no one who could have taken his trail at Cottonwoods and have  followed it to the edge of the bare slope in the pass, let alone up that  glistening smooth stone. Lassiter, however, was not an ordinary rider.  Instead of hunting cattle tracks he had likely spent a goodly portion  of his life tracking men. It was not improbable that among Oldring's  rustlers there was one who shared Lassiter's gift for trailing. And the  more Venters dwelt on this possibility the more perturbed he grew.    Lassiter's visit, moreover, had a disquieting effect upon Bess, and  Venters fancied that she entertained the same thought as to future  seclusion. The breaking of their solitude, though by a well-meaning  friend, had not only dispelled all its dream and much of its charm, but  had instilled a canker of fear. Both had seen the footprint in the sand.    Venters did no more work that day. Sunset and twilight gave way to  night, and the canyon bird whistled its melancholy notes, and the wind  sang softly in the cliffs, and the camp-fire blazed and burned down to  red embers. To Venters a subtle difference was apparent in all of these,  or else the shadowy change had been in him. He hoped that on the morrow  this slight depression would have passed away.    In that measure, however, he was doomed to disappointment. Furthermore,  Bess reverted to a wistful sadness that he had not observed in her since  her recovery. His attempt to cheer her out of it resulted in dismal  failure, and consequently in a darkening of his own mood. Hard work  relieved him; still, when the day had passed, his unrest returned.  Then he set to deliberate thinking, and there came to him the startling  conviction that he must leave Surprise Valley and take Bess with him.  As a rider he had taken many chances, and as an adventurer in Deception  Pass he had unhesitatingly risked his life, but now he would run no  preventable hazard of Bess's safety and happiness, and he was too keen  not to see that hazard. It gave him a pang to think of leaving the  beautiful valley just when he had the means to establish a permanent  and delightful home there. One flashing thought tore in hot temptation  through his mind--why not climb up into the gorge, roll Balancing Rock  down the trail, and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass? “That  was the beast in me--showing his teeth!” muttered Venters, scornfully.  “I'll just kill him good and quick! I'll be fair to this girl, if it's  the last thing I do on earth!”    Another day went by, in which he worked less and pondered more and  all the time covertly watched Bess. Her wistfulness had deepened into  downright unhappiness, and that made his task to tell her all the  harder. He kept the secret another day, hoping by some chance she might  grow less moody, and to his exceeding anxiety she fell into far deeper  gloom. Out of his own secret and the torment of it he divined that she,  too, had a secret and the keeping of it was torturing her. As yet he had  no plan thought out in regard to how or when to leave the valley, but  he decided to tell her the necessity of it and to persuade her to go.  Furthermore, he hoped his speaking out would induce her to unburden her  own mind.    “Bess, what's wrong with you?” he asked.    “Nothing,” she answered, with averted face.    Venters took hold of her gently, though masterfully, forced her to meet  his eyes.    “You can't look at me and lie,” he said. “Now--what's wrong with you?  You're keeping something from me. Well, I've got a secret, too, and I  intend to tell it presently.”    “Oh--I have a secret. I was crazy to tell you when you came back.  That's why I was so silly about everything. I kept holding my secret  back--gloating over it. But when Lassiter came I got an idea--that  changed my mind. Then I hated to tell you.”    “Are you going to now?”    “Yes--yes. I was coming to it. I tried yesterday, but you were so cold.  I was afraid. I couldn't keep it much longer.”    “Very well, most mysterious lady, tell your wonderful secret.”    “You needn't laugh,” she retorted, with a first glimpse of reviving  spirit. “I can take the laugh out of you in one second.”    “It's a go.”    She ran through the spruces to the cave, and returned carrying something  which was manifestly heavy. Upon nearer view he saw that whatever she  held with such evident importance had been bound up in a black scarf  he well remembered. That alone was sufficient to make him tingle with  curiosity.    “Have you any idea what I did in your absence?” she asked.    “I imagine you lounged about, waiting and watching for me,” he replied,  smiling. “I've my share of conceit, you know.”    “You're wrong. I worked. Look at my hands.” She dropped on her knees  close to where he sat, and, carefully depositing the black bundle, she  held out her hands. The palms and inside of her fingers were white,  puckered, and worn.    “Why, Bess, you've been fooling in the water,” he said.    “Fooling? Look here!” With deft fingers she spread open the black scarf,  and the bright sun shone upon a dull, glittering heap of gold.    “Gold!” he ejaculated.    “Yes, gold! See, pounds of gold! I found it--washed it out of the  stream--picked it out grain by grain, nugget by nugget!”    “Gold!” he cried.    “Yes. Now--now laugh at my secret!”    For a long minute Venters gazed. Then he stretched forth a hand to feel  if the gold was real.    “Gold!” he almost shouted. “Bess, there are hundreds--thousands of  dollars' worth here!”    He leaned over to her, and put his hand, strong and clenching now, on  hers.    “Is there more where this came from?” he whispered.    “Plenty of it, all the way up the stream to the cliff. You know I've  often washed for gold. Then I've heard the men talk. I think there's no  great quantity of gold here, but enough for--for a fortune for you.”    “That--was--your--secret!”    “Yes. I hate gold. For it makes men mad. I've seen them drunk with joy  and dance and fling themselves around. I've seen them curse and rave.  I've seen them fight like dogs and roll in the dust. I've seen them kill  each other for gold.”    “Is that why you hated to tell me?”    “Not--not altogether.” Bess lowered her head. “It was because I knew  you'd never stay here long after you found gold.”    “You were afraid I'd leave you?”    “Yes.    “Listen!... You great, simple child! Listen... You sweet, wonderful, wild,  blue-eyed girl! I was tortured by my secret. It was that I knew we--we  must leave the valley. We can't stay here much longer. I couldn't think  how we'd get away--out of the country--or how we'd live, if we ever got  out. I'm a beggar. That's why I kept my secret. I'm poor. It takes money  to make way beyond Sterling. We couldn't ride horses or burros or walk  forever. So while I knew we must go, I was distracted over how to go  and what to do. Now! We've gold! Once beyond Sterling, we'll be safe from  rustlers. We've no others to fear.    “Oh! Listen! Bess!” Venters now heard his voice ringing high and sweet,  and he felt Bess's cold hands in his crushing grasp as she leaned toward  him pale, breathless. “This is how much I'd leave you! You made me live  again! I'll take you away--far away from this wild country. You'll begin  a new life. You'll be happy. You shall see cities, ships, people. You  shall have anything your heart craves. All the shame and sorrow of your  life shall be forgotten--as if they had never been. This is how much I'd  leave you here alone--you sad-eyed girl. I love you! Didn't you know it?  How could you fail to know it? I love you! I'm free! I'm a man--a man  you've made--no more a beggar!... Kiss me! This is how much I'd leave  you here alone--you beautiful, strange, unhappy girl. But I'll make you  happy. What--what do I care for--your past! I love you! I'll take you  home to Illinois--to my mother. Then I'll take you to far places. I'll  make up all you've lost. Oh, I know you love me--knew it before you told  me. And it changed my life. And you'll go with me, not as my companion  as you are here, nor my sister, but, Bess, darling!... As my wife!”        CHAPTER XVII. WRANGLE'S RACE RUN    The plan eventually decided upon by the lovers was for Venters to go to  the village, secure a horse and some kind of a disguise for Bess, or  at least less striking apparel than her present garb, and to return  post-haste to the valley. Meanwhile, she would add to their store of  gold. Then they would strike the long and perilous trail to ride out of  Utah. In the event of his inability to fetch back a horse for her, they  intended to make the giant sorrel carry double. The gold, a little food,  saddle blankets, and Venters's guns were to compose the light outfit  with which they would make the start.    “I love this beautiful place,” said Bess. “It's hard to think of leaving  it.”    “Hard! Well, I should think so,” replied Venters. “Maybe--in years--”   But he did not complete in words his thought that might be possible to  return after many years of absence and change.    Once again Bess bade Venters farewell under the shadow of Balancing  Rock, and this time it was with whispered hope and tenderness and  passionate trust. Long after he had left her, all down through the  outlet to the Pass, the clinging clasp of her arms, the sweetness of  her lips, and the sense of a new and exquisite birth of character in her  remained hauntingly and thrillingly in his mind. The girl who had sadly  called herself nameless and nothing had been marvelously transformed  in the moment of his avowal of love. It was something to think over,  something to warm his heart, but for the present it had absolutely to be  forgotten so that all his mind could be addressed to the trip so fraught  with danger.    He carried only his rifle, revolver, and a small quantity of bread and  meat, and thus lightly burdened, he made swift progress down the slope  and out into the valley. Darkness was coming on, and he welcomed it.  Stars were blinking when he reached his old hiding-place in the split of  canyon wall, and by their aid he slipped through the dense thickets to  the grassy enclosure. Wrangle stood in the center of it with his head  up, and he appeared black and of gigantic proportions in the dim light.  Venters whistled softly, began a slow approach, and then called. The  horse snorted and, plunging away with dull, heavy sound of hoofs, he  disappeared in the gloom. “Wilder than ever!” muttered Venters. He  followed the sorrel into the narrowing split between the walls, and  presently had to desist because he could not see a foot in advance. As  he went back toward the open Wrangle jumped out of an ebony shadow of  cliff and like a thunderbolt shot huge and black past him down into  the starlit glade. Deciding that all attempts to catch Wrangle at night  would be useless, Venters repaired to the shelving rock where he had  hidden saddle and blanket, and there went to sleep.    The first peep of day found him stirring, and as soon as it was light  enough to distinguish objects, he took his lasso off his saddle and went  out to rope the sorrel. He espied Wrangle at the lower end of the cove  and approached him in a perfectly natural manner. When he got near  enough, Wrangle evidently recognized him, but was too wild to stand.  He ran up the glade and on into the narrow lane between the walls. This  favored Venters's speedy capture of the horse, so, coiling his noose  ready to throw, he hurried on. Wrangle let Venters get to within a  hundred feet and then he broke. But as he plunged by, rapidly getting  into his stride, Venters made a perfect throw with the rope. He had  time to brace himself for the shock; nevertheless, Wrangle threw him and  dragged him several yards before halting.    “You wild devil,” said Venters, as he slowly pulled Wrangle up. “Don't  you know me? Come now--old fellow--so--so--”    Wrangle yielded to the lasso and then to Venters's strong hand. He was  as straggly and wild-looking as a horse left to roam free in the sage.  He dropped his long ears and stood readily to be saddled and bridled.  But he was exceedingly sensitive, and quivered at every touch and sound.  Venters led him to the thicket, and, bending the close saplings to let  him squeeze through, at length reached the open. Sharp survey in each  direction assured him of the usual lonely nature of the canyon, then he  was in the saddle, riding south.    Wrangle's long, swinging canter was a wonderful ground-gainer. His  stride was almost twice that of an ordinary horse; and his endurance was  equally remarkable. Venters pulled him in occasionally, and walked him  up the stretches of rising ground and along the soft washes. Wrangle  had never yet shown any indication of distress while Venters rode him.  Nevertheless, there was now reason to save the horse, therefore Venters  did not resort to the hurry that had characterized his former trip.  He camped at the last water in the Pass. What distance that was to  Cottonwoods he did not know; he calculated, however, that it was in the  neighborhood of fifty miles.    Early in the morning he proceeded on his way, and about the middle of  the forenoon reached the constricted gap that marked the southerly end  of the Pass, and through which led the trail up to the sage-level. He  spied out Lassiter's tracks in the dust, but no others, and dismounting,  he straightened out Wrangle's bridle and began to lead him up the trail.  The short climb, more severe on beast than on man, necessitated a rest  on the level above, and during this he scanned the wide purple reaches  of slope.    Wrangle whistled his pleasure at the smell of the sage. Remounting,  Venters headed up the white trail with the fragrant wind in his face. He  had proceeded for perhaps a couple of miles when Wrangle stopped with a  suddenness that threw Venters heavily against the pommel.    “What's wrong, old boy?” called Venters, looking down for a loose shoe  or a snake or a foot lamed by a picked-up stone. Unrewarded, he raised  himself from his scrutiny. Wrangle stood stiff head high, with his  long ears erect. Thus guided, Venters swiftly gazed ahead to make out a  dust-clouded, dark group of horsemen riding down the slope. If they had  seen him, it apparently made no difference in their speed or direction.    “Wonder who they are!” exclaimed Venters. He was not disposed to run.  His cool mood tightened under grip of excitement as he reflected that,  whoever the approaching riders were, they could not be friends. He  slipped out of the saddle and led Wrangle behind the tallest sage-brush.  It might serve to conceal them until the riders were close enough for  him to see who they were; after that he would be indifferent to how soon  they discovered him.    After looking to his rifle and ascertaining that it was in working  order, he watched, and as he watched, slowly the force of a bitter  fierceness, long dormant, gathered ready to flame into life. If those  riders were not rustlers he had forgotten how rustlers looked and rode.  On they came, a small group, so compact and dark that he could not tell  their number. How unusual that their horses did not see Wrangle! But  such failure, Venters decided, was owing to the speed with which they  were traveling. They moved at a swift canter affected more by rustlers  than by riders. Venters grew concerned over the possibility that these  horsemen would actually ride down on him before he had a chance to  tell what to expect. When they were within three hundred yards he  deliberately led Wrangle out into the trail.    Then he heard shouts, and the hard scrape of sliding hoofs, and saw  horses rear and plunge back with up-flung heads and flying manes.  Several little white puffs of smoke appeared sharply against the black  background of riders and horses, and shots rang out. Bullets struck far  in front of Venters, and whipped up the dust and then hummed low into  the sage. The range was great for revolvers, but whether the shots were  meant to kill or merely to check advance, they were enough to fire that  waiting ferocity in Venters. Slipping his arm through the bridle, so  that Wrangle could not get away, Venters lifted his rifle and pulled the  trigger twice.    He saw the first horseman lean sideways and fall. He saw another lurch  in his saddle and heard a cry of pain. Then Wrangle, plunging in fright,  lifted Venters and nearly threw him. He jerked the horse down with  a powerful hand and leaped into the saddle. Wrangle plunged again,  dragging his bridle, that Venters had not had time to throw in place.  Bending over with a swift movement, he secured it and dropped the loop  over the pommel. Then, with grinding teeth, he looked to see what the  issue would be.    The band had scattered so as not to afford such a broad mark for  bullets. The riders faced Venters, some with red-belching guns. He heard  a sharper report, and just as Wrangle plunged again he caught the whim  of a leaden missile that would have hit him but for Wrangle's sudden  jump. A swift, hot wave, turning cold, passed over Venters. Deliberately  he picked out the one rider with a carbine, and killed him. Wrangle  snorted shrilly and bolted into the sage. Venters let him run a few  rods, then with iron arm checked him.    Five riders, surely rustlers, were left. One leaped out of the saddle to  secure his fallen comrade's carbine. A shot from Venters, which missed  the man but sent the dust flying over him made him run back to his  horse. Then they separated. The crippled rider went one way; the one  frustrated in his attempt to get the carbine rode another, Venters  thought he made out a third rider, carrying a strange-appearing bundle  and disappearing in the sage. But in the rapidity of action and vision  he could not discern what it was. Two riders with three horses swung  out to the right. Afraid of the long rifle--a burdensome weapon seldom  carried by rustlers or riders--they had been put to rout.    Suddenly Venters discovered that one of the two men last noted was  riding Jane Withersteen's horse Bells--the beautiful bay racer she had  given to Lassiter. Venters uttered a savage outcry. Then the small,  wiry, frog-like shape of the second rider, and the ease and grace of his  seat in the saddle--things so strikingly incongruous--grew more and more  familiar in Venters's sight.    “Jerry Card!” cried Venters.    It was indeed Tull's right-hand man. Such a white hot wrath inflamed  Venters that he fought himself to see with clearer gaze.    “It's Jerry Card!” he exclaimed, instantly. “And he's riding Black Star  and leading Night!”    The long-kindling, stormy fire in Venters's heart burst into flame. He  spurred Wrangle, and as the horse lengthened his stride Venters slipped  cartridges into the magazine of his rifle till it was once again full.  Card and his companion were now half a mile or more in advance, riding  easily down the slope. Venters marked the smooth gait, and understood it  when Wrangle galloped out of the sage into the broad cattle trail,  down which Venters had once tracked Jane Withersteen's red herd. This  hard-packed trail, from years of use, was as clean and smooth as a road.  Venters saw Jerry Card look back over his shoulder, the other rider did  likewise. Then the three racers lengthened their stride to the point  where the swinging canter was ready to break into a gallop.    “Wrangle, the race's on,” said Venters, grimly. “We'll canter with them  and gallop with them and run with them. We'll let them set the pace.”    Venters knew he bestrode the strongest, swiftest, most tireless horse  ever ridden by any rider across the Utah uplands. Recalling Jane  Withersteen's devoted assurance that Night could run neck and neck with  Wrangle, and Black Star could show his heels to him, Venters wished  that Jane were there to see the race to recover her blacks and in the  unqualified superiority of the giant sorrel. Then Venters found himself  thankful that she was absent, for he meant that race to end in Jerry  Card's death. The first flush, the raging of Venters's wrath, passed, to  leave him in sullen, almost cold possession of his will. It was a deadly  mood, utterly foreign to his nature, engendered, fostered, and released  by the wild passions of wild men in a wild country. The strength in  him then--the thing rife in him that was not hate, but something as  remorseless--might have been the fiery fruition of a whole lifetime of  vengeful quest. Nothing could have stopped him.    Venters thought out the race shrewdly. The rider on Bells would probably  drop behind and take to the sage. What he did was of little moment  to Venters. To stop Jerry Card, his evil hidden career as well as  his present flight, and then to catch the blacks--that was all that  concerned Venters. The cattle trail wound for miles and miles down the  slope. Venters saw with a rider's keen vision ten, fifteen, twenty miles  of clear purple sage. There were no on-coming riders or rustlers to aid  Card. His only chance to escape lay in abandoning the stolen horses and  creeping away in the sage to hide. In ten miles Wrangle could run  Black Star and Night off their feet, and in fifteen he could kill them  outright. So Venters held the sorrel in, letting Card make the running.  It was a long race that would save the blacks.    In a few miles of that swinging canter Wrangle had crept appreciably  closer to the three horses. Jerry Card turned again, and when he saw how  the sorrel had gained, he put Black Star to a gallop. Night and Bells,  on either side of him, swept into his stride.    Venters loosened the rein on Wrangle and let him break into a gallop.  The sorrel saw the horses ahead and wanted to run. But Venters  restrained him. And in the gallop he gained more than in the canter.  Bells was fast in that gait, but Black Star and Night had been trained  to run. Slowly Wrangle closed the gap down to a quarter of a mile, and  crept closer and closer.    Jerry Card wheeled once more. Venters distinctly saw the red flash of  his red face. This time he looked long. Venters laughed. He knew what  passed in Card's mind. The rider was trying to make out what horse it  happened to be that thus gained on Jane Withersteen's peerless racers.  Wrangle had so long been away from the village that not improbably Jerry  had forgotten. Besides, whatever Jerry's qualifications for his fame as  the greatest rider of the sage, certain it was that his best point was  not far-sightedness. He had not recognized Wrangle. After what must have  been a searching gaze he got his comrade to face about. This action gave  Venters amusement. It spoke so surely of the facts that neither Card  nor the rustler actually knew their danger. Yet if they kept to the  trail--and the last thing such men would do would be to leave it--they  were both doomed.    This comrade of Card's whirled far around in his saddle, and he even  shaded his eyes from the sun. He, too, looked long. Then, all at once,  he faced ahead again and, bending lower in the saddle, began to fling  his right arm up and down. That flinging Venters knew to be the lashing  of Bells. Jerry also became active. And the three racers lengthened out  into a run.    “Now, Wrangle!” cried Venters. “Run, you big devil! Run!”    Venters laid the reins on Wrangle's neck and dropped the loop over  the pommel. The sorrel needed no guiding on that smooth trail. He was  surer-footed in a run than at any other fast gait, and his running gave  the impression of something devilish. He might now have been actuated by  Venters's spirit; undoubtedly his savage running fitted the mood of his  rider. Venters bent forward swinging with the horse, and gripped his  rifle. His eye measured the distance between him and Jerry Card.    In less than two miles of running Bells began to drop behind the blacks,  and Wrangle began to overhaul him. Venters anticipated that the rustler  would soon take to the sage. Yet he did not. Not improbably he reasoned  that the powerful sorrel could more easily overtake Bells in the heavier  going outside of the trail. Soon only a few hundred yards lay between  Bells and Wrangle. Turning in his saddle, the rustler began to shoot,  and the bullets beat up little whiffs of dust. Venters raised his rifle,  ready to take snap shots, and waited for favorable opportunity when  Bells was out of line with the forward horses. Venters had it in him  to kill these men as if they were skunk-bitten coyotes, but also he had  restraint enough to keep from shooting one of Jane's beloved Arabians.    No great distance was covered, however, before Bells swerved to the  left, out of line with Black Star and Night. Then Venters, aiming high  and waiting for the pause between Wrangle's great strides, began to take  snap shots at the rustler. The fleeing rider presented a broad target  for a rifle, but he was moving swiftly forward and bobbing up and down.  Moreover, shooting from Wrangle's back was shooting from a thunderbolt.  And added to that was the danger of a low-placed bullet taking effect  on Bells. Yet, despite these considerations, making the shot exceedingly  difficult, Venters's confidence, like his implacability, saw a speedy  and fatal termination of that rustler's race. On the sixth shot the  rustler threw up his arms and took a flying tumble off his horse. He  rolled over and over, hunched himself to a half-erect position, fell,  and then dragged himself into the sage. As Venters went thundering by he  peered keenly into the sage, but caught no sign of the man. Bells ran a  few hundred yards, slowed up, and had stopped when Wrangle passed him.    Again Venters began slipping fresh cartridges into the magazine of his  rifle, and his hand was so sure and steady that he did not drop a single  cartridge. With the eye of a rider and the judgment of a marksman he  once more measured the distance between him and Jerry Card. Wrangle had  gained, bringing him into rifle range. Venters was hard put to it now  not to shoot, but thought it better to withhold his fire. Jerry, who, in  anticipation of a running fusillade, had huddled himself into a little  twisted ball on Black Star's neck, now surmising that this pursuer would  make sure of not wounding one of the blacks, rose to his natural seat in  the saddle.    In his mind perhaps, as certainly as in Venters's, this moment was the  beginning of the real race.    Venters leaned forward to put his hand on Wrangle's neck, then backward  to put it on his flank. Under the shaggy, dusty hair trembled and  vibrated and rippled a wonderful muscular activity. But Wrangle's flesh  was still cold. What a cold-blooded brute thought Venters, and felt in  him a love for the horse he had never given to any other. It would not  have been humanly possible for any rider, even though clutched by hate  or revenge or a passion to save a loved one or fear of his own life, to  be astride the sorrel to swing with his swing, to see his magnificent  stride and hear the rapid thunder of his hoofs, to ride him in that race  and not glory in the ride.    So, with his passion to kill still keen and unabated, Venters lived out  that ride, and drank a rider's sage-sweet cup of wildness to the dregs.    When Wrangle's long mane, lashing in the wind, stung Venters in the  cheek, the sting added a beat to his flying pulse. He bent a downward  glance to try to see Wrangle's actual stride, and saw only twinkling,  darting streaks and the white rush of the trail. He watched the sorrel's  savage head, pointed level, his mouth still closed and dry, but his  nostrils distended as if he were snorting unseen fire. Wrangle was the  horse for a race with death. Upon each side Venters saw the sage merged  into a sailing, colorless wall. In front sloped the lay of ground with  its purple breadth split by the white trail. The wind, blowing with  heavy, steady blast into his face, sickened him with enduring, sweet  odor, and filled his ears with a hollow, rushing roar.    Then for the hundredth time he measured the width of space separating  him from Jerry Card. Wrangle had ceased to gain. The blacks were proving  their fleetness. Venters watched Jerry Card, admiring the little rider's  horsemanship. He had the incomparable seat of the upland rider, born in  the saddle. It struck Venters that Card had changed his position, or  the position of the horses. Presently Venters remembered positively that  Jerry had been leading Night on the right-hand side of the trail. The  racer was now on the side to the left. No--it was Black Star. But,  Venters argued in amaze, Jerry had been mounted on Black Star. Another  clearer, keener gaze assured Venters that Black Star was really  riderless. Night now carried Jerry Card.    “He's changed from one to the other!” ejaculated Venters, realizing the  astounding feat with unstinted admiration. “Changed at full speed! Jerry  Card, that's what you've done unless I'm drunk on the smell of sage. But  I've got to see the trick before I believe it.”    Thenceforth, while Wrangle sped on, Venters glued his eyes to the little  rider. Jerry Card rode as only he could ride. Of all the daring  horsemen of the uplands, Jerry was the one rider fitted to bring out the  greatness of the blacks in that long race. He had them on a dead run,  but not yet at the last strained and killing pace. From time to time he  glanced backward, as a wise general in retreat calculating his chances  and the power and speed of pursuers, and the moment for the last  desperate burst. No doubt, Card, with his life at stake, gloried in that  race, perhaps more wildly than Venters. For he had been born to the sage  and the saddle and the wild. He was more than half horse. Not until the  last call--the sudden up-flashing instinct of self-preservation--would  he lose his skill and judgment and nerve and the spirit of that race.  Venters seemed to read Jerry's mind. That little crime-stained rider was  actually thinking of his horses, husbanding their speed, handling them  with knowledge of years, glorying in their beautiful, swift, racing  stride, and wanting them to win the race when his own life hung  suspended in quivering balance. Again Jerry whirled in his saddle and  the sun flashed red on his face. Turning, he drew Black Star closer and  closer toward Night, till they ran side by side, as one horse. Then Card  raised himself in the saddle, slipped out of the stirrups, and, somehow  twisting himself, leaped upon Black Star. He did not even lose the swing  of the horse. Like a leech he was there in the other saddle, and as the  horses separated, his right foot, that had been apparently doubled under  him, shot down to catch the stirrup. The grace and dexterity and daring  of that rider's act won something more than admiration from Venters.    For the distance of a mile Jerry rode Black Star and then changed back  to Night. But all Jerry's skill and the running of the blacks could  avail little more against the sorrel.    Venters peered far ahead, studying the lay of the land. Straightaway  for five miles the trail stretched, and then it disappeared in hummocky  ground. To the right, some few rods, Venters saw a break in the sage,  and this was the rim of Deception Pass. Across the dark cleft gleamed  the red of the opposite wall. Venters imagined that the trail went down  into the Pass somewhere north of those ridges. And he realized that  he must and would overtake Jerry Card in this straight course of five  miles.    Cruelly he struck his spurs into Wrangle's flanks. A light touch of spur  was sufficient to make Wrangle plunge. And now, with a ringing, wild  snort, he seemed to double up in muscular convulsions and to shoot  forward with an impetus that almost unseated Venters. The sage blurred  by, the trail flashed by, and the wind robbed him of breath and hearing.  Jerry Card turned once more. And the way he shifted to Black Star showed  he had to make his last desperate running. Venters aimed to the side of  the trail and sent a bullet puffing the dust beyond Jerry. Venters  hoped to frighten the rider and get him to take to the sage. But Jerry  returned the shot, and his ball struck dangerously close in the dust  at Wrangle's flying feet. Venters held his fire then, while the rider  emptied his revolver. For a mile, with Black Star leaving Night behind  and doing his utmost, Wrangle did not gain; for another mile he gained  little, if at all. In the third he caught up with the now galloping  Night and began to gain rapidly on the other black.    Only a hundred yards now stretched between Black Star and Wrangle. The  giant sorrel thundered on--and on--and on. In every yard he gained  a foot. He was whistling through his nostrils, wringing wet, flying  lather, and as hot as fire. Savage as ever, strong as ever, fast as  ever, but each tremendous stride jarred Venters out of the saddle!  Wrangle's power and spirit and momentum had begun to run him off his  legs. Wrangle's great race was nearly won--and run. Venters seemed to  see the expanse before him as a vast, sheeted, purple plain sliding  under him. Black Star moved in it as a blur. The rider, Jerry Card,  appeared a mere dot bobbing dimly. Wrangle thundered on--on--on! Venters  felt the increase in quivering, straining shock after every leap. Flecks  of foam flew into Venters's eyes, burning him, making him see all the  sage as red. But in that red haze he saw, or seemed to see, Black Star  suddenly riderless and with broken gait. Wrangle thundered on to change  his pace with a violent break. Then Venters pulled him hard. From run  to gallop, gallop to canter, canter to trot, trot to walk, and walk to  stop, the great sorrel ended his race.    Venters looked back. Black Star stood riderless in the trail. Jerry  Card had taken to the sage. Far up the white trail Night came trotting  faithfully down. Venters leaped off, still half blind, reeling dizzily.  In a moment he had recovered sufficiently to have a care for Wrangle.  Rapidly he took off the saddle and bridle. The sorrel was reeking,  heaving, whistling, shaking. But he had still the strength to stand, and  for him Venters had no fears.    As Venters ran back to Black Star he saw the horse stagger on shaking  legs into the sage and go down in a heap. Upon reaching him Venters  removed the saddle and bridle. Black Star had been killed on his legs,  Venters thought. He had no hope for the stricken horse. Black Star  lay flat, covered with bloody froth, mouth wide, tongue hanging, eyes  glaring, and all his beautiful body in convulsions.    Unable to stay there to see Jane's favorite racer die, Venters hurried  up the trail to meet the other black. On the way he kept a sharp lookout  for Jerry Card. Venters imagined the rider would keep well out of range  of the rifle, but, as he would be lost on the sage without a horse, not  improbably he would linger in the vicinity on the chance of getting back  one of the blacks. Night soon came trotting up, hot and wet and run out.  Venters led him down near the others, and unsaddling him, let him loose  to rest. Night wearily lay down in the dust and rolled, proving himself  not yet spent.    Then Venters sat down to rest and think. Whatever the risk, he was  compelled to stay where he was, or comparatively near, for the night.  The horses must rest and drink. He must find water. He was now seventy  miles from Cottonwoods, and, he believed, close to the canyon where the  cattle trail must surely turn off and go down into the Pass. After a  while he rose to survey the valley.    He was very near to the ragged edge of a deep canyon into which the  trail turned. The ground lay in uneven ridges divided by washes, and  these sloped into the canyon. Following the canyon line, he saw where  its rim was broken by other intersecting canyons, and farther down red  walls and yellow cliffs leading toward a deep blue cleft that he made  sure was Deception Pass. Walking out a few rods to a promontory, he  found where the trail went down. The descent was gradual, along a  stone-walled trail, and Venters felt sure that this was the place where  Oldring drove cattle into the Pass. There was, however, no indication at  all that he ever had driven cattle out at this point. Oldring had many  holes to his burrow.    In searching round in the little hollows Venters, much to his relief,  found water. He composed himself to rest and eat some bread and meat,  while he waited for a sufficient time to elapse so that he could safely  give the horses a drink. He judged the hour to be somewhere around noon.  Wrangle lay down to rest and Night followed suit. So long as they  were down Venters intended to make no move. The longer they rested  the better, and the safer it would be to give them water. By and by he  forced himself to go over to where Black Star lay, expecting to find  him dead. Instead he found the racer partially if not wholly recovered.  There was recognition, even fire, in his big black eyes. Venters was  overjoyed. He sat by the black for a long time. Black Star presently  labored to his feet with a heave and a groan, shook himself, and snorted  for water. Venters repaired to the little pool he had found, filled  his sombrero, and gave the racer a drink. Black Star gulped it at one  draught, as if it were but a drop, and pushed his nose into the hat  and snorted for more. Venters now led Night down to drink, and after a  further time Black Star also. Then the blacks began to graze.    The sorrel had wandered off down the sage between the trail and the  canyon. Once or twice he disappeared in little swales. Finally Venters  concluded Wrangle had grazed far enough, and, taking his lasso, he went  to fetch him back. In crossing from one ridge to another he saw where  the horse had made muddy a pool of water. It occurred to Venters then  that Wrangle had drunk his fill, and did not seem the worse for it, and  might be anything but easy to catch. And, true enough, he could not come  within roping reach of the sorrel. He tried for an hour, and gave up in  disgust. Wrangle did not seem so wild as simply perverse. In a quandary  Venters returned to the other horses, hoping much, yet doubting more,  that when Wrangle had grazed to suit himself he might be caught.    As the afternoon wore away Venters's concern diminished, yet he kept  close watch on the blacks and the trail and the sage. There was no  telling of what Jerry Card might be capable. Venters sullenly acquiesced  to the idea that the rider had been too quick and too shrewd for him.  Strangely and doggedly, however, Venters clung to his foreboding of  Card's downfall.    The wind died away; the red sun topped the far distant western rise of  slope; and the long, creeping purple shadows lengthened. The rims of the  canyons gleamed crimson and the deep clefts appeared to belch forth blue  smoke. Silence enfolded the scene.    It was broken by a horrid, long-drawn scream of a horse and the thudding  of heavy hoofs. Venters sprang erect and wheeled south. Along the canyon  rim, near the edge, came Wrangle, once more in thundering flight.    Venters gasped in amazement. Had the wild sorrel gone mad? His head  was high and twisted, in a most singular position for a running horse.  Suddenly Venters descried a frog-like shape clinging to Wrangle's neck.  Jerry Card! Somehow he had straddled Wrangle and now stuck like a huge  burr. But it was his strange position and the sorrel's wild scream that  shook Venters's nerves. Wrangle was pounding toward the turn where the  trail went down. He plunged onward like a blind horse. More than one of  his leaps took him to the very edge of the precipice.    Jerry Card was bent forward with his teeth fast in the front of  Wrangle's nose! Venters saw it, and there flashed over him a memory of  this trick of a few desperate riders. He even thought of one rider  who had worn off his teeth in this terrible hold to break or control  desperate horses. Wrangle had indeed gone mad. The marvel was what  guided him. Was it the half-brute, the more than half-horse instinct of  Jerry Card? Whatever the mystery, it was true. And in a few more rods  Jerry would have the sorrel turning into the trail leading down into the  canyon.    “No--Jerry!” whispered Venters, stepping forward and throwing up the  rifle. He tried to catch the little humped, frog-like shape over the  sights. It was moving too fast; it was too small. Yet Venters shot  once... twice... the third time... four times... five! all wasted shots and  precious seconds!    With a deep-muttered curse Venters caught Wrangle through the sights and  pulled the trigger. Plainly he heard the bullet thud. Wrangle uttered  a horrible strangling sound. In swift death action he whirled, and  with one last splendid leap he cleared the canyon rim. And he whirled  downward with the little frog-like shape clinging to his neck!    There was a pause which seemed never ending, a shock, and an instant's  silence.    Then up rolled a heavy crash, a long roar of sliding rocks dying away in  distant echo, then silence unbroken.    Wrangle's race was run.        CHAPTER XVIII. OLDRING'S KNELL    Some forty hours or more later Venters created a commotion in  Cottonwoods by riding down the main street on Black Star and leading  Bells and Night. He had come upon Bells grazing near the body of a dead  rustler, the only incident of his quick ride into the village.    Nothing was farther from Venters's mind than bravado. No thought came  to him of the defiance and boldness of riding Jane Withersteen's racers  straight into the arch-plotter's stronghold. He wanted men to see the  famous Arabians; he wanted men to see them dirty and dusty, bearing all  the signs of having been driven to their limit; he wanted men to see and  to know that the thieves who had ridden them out into the sage had not  ridden them back. Venters had come for that and for more--he wanted to  meet Tull face to face; if not Tull, then Dyer; if not Dyer, then anyone  in the secret of these master conspirators. Such was Venters's passion.  The meeting with the rustlers, the unprovoked attack upon him, the  spilling of blood, the recognition of Jerry Card and the horses, the  race, and that last plunge of mad Wrangle--all these things, fuel on  fuel to the smoldering fire, had kindled and swelled and leaped into  living flame. He could have shot Dyer in the midst of his religious  services at the altar; he could have killed Tull in front of wives and  babes.    He walked the three racers down the broad, green-bordered village road.  He heard the murmur of running water from Amber Spring. Bitter waters  for Jane Withersteen! Men and women stopped to gaze at him and the  horses. All knew him; all knew the blacks and the bay. As well as if it  had been spoken, Venters read in the faces of men the intelligence that  Jane Withersteen's Arabians had been known to have been stolen. Venters  reined in and halted before Dyer's residence. It was a low, long, stone  structure resembling Withersteen House. The spacious front yard was  green and luxuriant with grass and flowers; gravel walks led to the huge  porch; a well-trimmed hedge of purple sage separated the yard from the  church grounds; birds sang in the trees; water flowed musically along  the walks; and there were glad, careless shouts of children. For Venters  the beauty of this home, and the serenity and its apparent happiness,  all turned red and black. For Venters a shade overspread the lawn, the  flowers, the old vine-clad stone house. In the music of the singing  birds, in the murmur of the running water, he heard an ominous sound.  Quiet beauty--sweet music--innocent laughter! By what monstrous abortion  of fate did these abide in the shadow of Dyer?    Venters rode on and stopped before Tull's cottage. Women stared at him  with white faces and then flew from the porch. Tull himself appeared  at the door, bent low, craning his neck. His dark face flashed out of  sight; the door banged; a heavy bar dropped with a hollow sound.    Then Venters shook Black Star's bridle, and, sharply trotting, led the  other horses to the center of the village. Here at the intersecting  streets and in front of the stores he halted once more. The usual  lounging atmosphere of that prominent corner was not now in evidence.  Riders and ranchers and villagers broke up what must have been absorbing  conversation. There was a rush of many feet, and then the walk was lined  with faces.    Venters's glance swept down the line of silent stone-faced men. He  recognized many riders and villagers, but none of those he had hoped  to meet. There was no expression in the faces turned toward him. All  of them knew him, most were inimical, but there were few who were  not burning with curiosity and wonder in regard to the return of Jane  Withersteen's racers. Yet all were silent. Here were the familiar  characteristics--masked feeling--strange secretiveness--expressionless  expression of mystery and hidden power.    “Has anybody here seen Jerry Card?” queried Venters, in a loud voice.    In reply there came not a word, not a nod or shake of head, not so much  as dropping eye or twitching lip--nothing but a quiet, stony stare.    “Been under the knife? You've a fine knife-wielder here--one Tull, I  believe!... Maybe you've all had your tongues cut out?”    This passionate sarcasm of Venters brought no response, and the stony  calm was as oil on the fire within him.    “I see some of you pack guns, too!” he added, in biting scorn. In the  long, tense pause, strung keenly as a tight wire, he sat motionless on  Black Star. “All right,” he went on. “Then let some of you take this  message to Tull. Tell him I've seen Jerry Card! ... Tell him Jerry Card  will never return!”    Thereupon, in the same dead calm, Venters backed Black Star away from  the curb, into the street, and out of range. He was ready now to ride up  to Withersteen House and turn the racers over to Jane.    “Hello, Venters!” a familiar voice cried, hoarsely, and he saw a man  running toward him. It was the rider Judkins who came up and gripped  Venters's hand. “Venters, I could hev dropped when I seen them hosses.  But thet sight ain't a marker to the looks of you. What's wrong? Hev  you gone crazy? You must be crazy to ride in here this way--with them  hosses--talkie' thet way about Tull en' Jerry Card.”    “Jud, I'm not crazy--only mad clean through,” replied Venters.    “Mad, now, Bern, I'm glad to hear some of your old self in your voice.  Fer when you come up you looked like the corpse of a dead rider with  fire fer eyes. You hed thet crowd too stiff fer throwin' guns. Come,  we've got to hev a talk. Let's go up the lane. We ain't much safe here.”    Judkins mounted Bells and rode with Venters up to the cottonwood grove.  Here they dismounted and went among the trees.    “Let's hear from you first,” said Judkins. “You fetched back them  hosses. Thet is the trick. An', of course, you got Jerry the same as you  got Horne.”    “Horne!”    “Sure. He was found dead yesterday all chewed by coyotes, en' he'd been  shot plumb center.”    “Where was he found?”    “At the split down the trail--you know where Oldring's cattle trail runs  off north from the trail to the pass.”    “That's where I met Jerry and the rustlers. What was Horne doing with  them? I thought Horne was an honest cattle-man.”    “Lord--Bern, don't ask me thet! I'm all muddled now tryin' to figure  things.”    Venters told of the fight and the race with Jerry Card and its tragic  conclusion.    “I knowed it! I knowed all along that Wrangle was the best hoss!”   exclaimed Judkins, with his lean face working and his eyes lighting.  “Thet was a race! Lord, I'd like to hev seen Wrangle jump the cliff with  Jerry. An' thet was good-by to the grandest hoss an' rider ever on the  sage!... But, Bern, after you got the hosses why'd you want to bolt right  in Tull's face?”    “I want him to know. An' if I can get to him I'll--”    “You can't get near Tull,” interrupted Judkins. “Thet vigilante bunch  hev taken to bein' bodyguard for Tull an' Dyer, too.”    “Hasn't Lassiter made a break yet?” inquired Venters, curiously.    “Naw!” replied Judkins, scornfully. “Jane turned his head. He's mad in  love over her--follers her like a dog. He ain't no more Lassiter! He's  lost his nerve, he doesn't look like the same feller. It's village talk.  Everybody knows it. He hasn't thrown a gun, an' he won't!”    “Jud, I'll bet he does,” replied Venters, earnestly. “Remember what I  say. This Lassiter is something more than a gun-man. Jud, he's big--he's  great!... I feel that in him. God help Tull and Dyer when Lassiter does  go after them. For horses and riders and stone walls won't save them.”    “Wal, hev it your way, Bern. I hope you're right. Nat'rully I've been  some sore on Lassiter fer gittin' soft. But I ain't denyin' his nerve,  or whatever's great in him thet sort of paralyzes people. No later 'n  this mornin' I seen him saunterin' down the lane, quiet an' slow. An'  like his guns he comes black--black, thet's Lassiter. Wal, the crowd  on the corner never batted an eye, en' I'll gamble my hoss thet there  wasn't one who hed a heartbeat till Lassiter got by. He went in Snell's  saloon, an' as there wasn't no gun play I had to go in, too. An' there,  darn my pictures, if Lassiter wasn't standin' to the bar, drinking en'  talkin' with Oldrin'.”    “Oldring!” whispered Venters. His voice, as all fire and pulse within  him, seemed to freeze.    “Let go my arm!” exclaimed Judkins. “Thet's my bad arm. Sure it was  Oldrin'. What the hell's wrong with you, anyway? Venters, I tell you  somethin's wrong. You're whiter 'n a sheet. You can't be scared of the  rustler. I don't believe you've got a scare in you. Wal, now, jest let  me talk. You know I like to talk, an' if I'm slow I allus git there  sometime. As I said, Lassiter was talkie' chummy with Oldrin'. There  wasn't no hard feelin's. An' the gang wasn't payin' no pertic'lar  attention. But like a cat watchin' a mouse I hed my eyes on them two  fellers. It was strange to me, thet confab. I'm gittin' to think a lot,  fer a feller who doesn't know much. There's been some queer deals lately  an' this seemed to me the queerest. These men stood to the bar alone,  an' so close their big gun-hilts butted together. I seen Oldrin' was  some surprised at first, an' Lassiter was cool as ice. They talked, an'  presently at somethin' Lassiter said the rustler bawled out a curse, an'  then he jest fell up against the bar, an' sagged there. The gang in the  saloon looked around an' laughed, an' thet's about all. Finally Oldrin'  turned, and it was easy to see somethin' hed shook him. Yes, sir, thet  big rustler--you know he's as broad as he is long, an' the powerfulest  build of a man--yes, sir, the nerve had been taken out of him. Then,  after a little, he began to talk an' said a lot to Lassiter, an' by an'  by it didn't take much of an eye to see thet Lassiter was gittin' hit  hard. I never seen him anyway but cooler 'n ice--till then. He seemed to  be hit harder 'n Oldrin', only he didn't roar out thet way. He jest kind  of sunk in, an' looked an' looked, an' he didn't see a livin' soul  in thet saloon. Then he sort of come to, an' shakin' hands--mind you,  shakin' hands with Oldrin'--he went out. I couldn't help thinkin' how  easy even a boy could hev dropped the great gun-man then!... Wal, the  rustler stood at the bar fer a long time, en' he was seein' things far  off, too; then he come to an' roared fer whisky, an' gulped a drink thet  was big enough to drown me.”    “Is Oldring here now?” whispered Venters. He could not speak above a  whisper. Judkins's story had been meaningless to him.    “He's at Snell's yet. Bern, I hevn't told you yet thet the rustlers hev  been raisin' hell. They shot up Stone Bridge an' Glaze, an' fer three  days they've been here drinkin' an' gamblin' an' throwin' of gold. These  rustlers hev a pile of gold. If it was gold dust or nugget gold I'd hev  reason to think, but it's new coin gold, as if it had jest come from the  United States treasury. An' the coin's genuine. Thet's all been proved.  The truth is Oldrin's on a rampage. A while back he lost his Masked  Rider, an' they say he's wild about thet. I'm wonderin' if Lassiter  could hev told the rustler anythin' about thet little masked,  hard-ridin' devil. Ride! He was most as good as Jerry Card. An', Bern,  I've been wonderin' if you know--”    “Judkins, you're a good fellow,” interrupted Venters. “Some day I'll  tell you a story. I've no time now. Take the horses to Jane.”    Judkins stared, and then, muttering to himself, he mounted Bells, and  stared again at Venters, and then, leading the other horses, he rode  into the grove and disappeared.    Once, long before, on the night Venters had carried Bess through the  canyon and up into Surprise Valley, he had experienced the strangeness  of faculties singularly, tinglingly acute. And now the same sensation  recurred. But it was different in that he felt cold, frozen, mechanical  incapable of free thought, and all about him seemed unreal, aloof,  remote. He hid his rifle in the sage, marking its exact location with  extreme care. Then he faced down the lane and strode toward the center  of the village. Perceptions flashed upon him, the faint, cold touch of  the breeze, a cold, silvery tinkle of flowing water, a cold sun shining  out of a cold sky, song of birds and laugh of children, coldly distant.  Cold and intangible were all things in earth and heaven. Colder and  tighter stretched the skin over his face; colder and harder grew the  polished butts of his guns; colder and steadier became his hands as he  wiped the clammy sweat from his face or reached low to his gun-sheaths.  Men meeting him in the walk gave him wide berth. In front of Bevin's  store a crowd melted apart for his passage, and their faces and whispers  were faces and whispers of a dream. He turned a corner to meet Tull  face to face, eye to eye. As once before he had seen this man pale to  a ghastly, livid white so again he saw the change. Tull stopped in his  tracks, with right hand raised and shaking. Suddenly it dropped, and he  seemed to glide aside, to pass out of Venters's sight. Next he saw  many horses with bridles down--all clean-limbed, dark bays or  blacks--rustlers' horses! Loud voices and boisterous laughter, rattle of  dice and scrape of chair and clink of gold, burst in mingled din from an  open doorway. He stepped inside.    With the sight of smoke-hazed room and drinking, cursing, gambling,  dark-visaged men, reality once more dawned upon Venters.    His entrance had been unnoticed, and he bent his gaze upon the drinkers  at the bar. Dark-clothed, dark-faced men they all were, burned by the  sun, bow-legged as were most riders of the sage, but neither lean nor  gaunt. Then Venters's gaze passed to the tables, and swiftly it swept  over the hard-featured gamesters, to alight upon the huge, shaggy, black  head of the rustler chief.    “Oldring!” he cried, and to him his voice seemed to split a bell in his  ears.    It stilled the din.    That silence suddenly broke to the scrape and crash of Oldring's chair  as he rose; and then, while he passed, a great gloomy figure, again the  thronged room stilled in silence yet deeper.    “Oldring, a word with you!” continued Venters.    “Ho! What's this?” boomed Oldring, in frowning scrutiny.    “Come outside, alone. A word for you--from your Masked Rider!”    Oldring kicked a chair out of his way and lunged forward with a stamp  of heavy boot that jarred the floor. He waved down his muttering, rising  men.    Venters backed out of the door and waited, hearing, as no sound had ever  before struck into his soul, the rapid, heavy steps of the rustler.    Oldring appeared, and Venters had one glimpse of his great breadth and  bulk, his gold-buckled belt with hanging guns, his high-top boots  with gold spurs. In that moment Venters had a strange, unintelligible  curiosity to see Oldring alive. The rustler's broad brow, his large  black eyes, his sweeping beard, as dark as the wing of a raven, his  enormous width of shoulder and depth of chest, his whole splendid  presence so wonderfully charged with vitality and force and strength,  seemed to afford Venters an unutterable fiendish joy because for that  magnificent manhood and life he meant cold and sudden death.    “Oldring, Bess is alive! But she's dead to you--dead to the life you  made her lead--dead as you will be in one second!”    Swift as lightning Venters's glance dropped from Oldring's rolling  eyes to his hands. One of them, the right, swept out, then toward his  gun--and Venters shot him through the heart.    Slowly Oldring sank to his knees, and the hand, dragging at the gun,  fell away. Venters's strangely acute faculties grasped the meaning  of that limp arm, of the swaying hulk, of the gasp and heave, of the  quivering beard. But was that awful spirit in the black eyes only one of  vitality?    “Man--why--didn't--you--wait? Bess--was--” Oldring's whisper died under  his beard, and with a heavy lurch he fell forward.    Bounding swiftly away, Venters fled around the corner, across the  street, and, leaping a hedge, he ran through yard, orchard, and garden  to the sage. Here, under cover of the tall brush, he turned west and ran  on to the place where he had hidden his rifle. Securing that, he again  set out into a run, and, circling through the sage, came up behind Jane  Withersteen's stable and corrals. With laboring, dripping chest, and  pain as of a knife thrust in his side, he stopped to regain his breath,  and while resting his eyes roved around in search of a horse. Doors  and windows of the stable were open wide and had a deserted look. One  dejected, lonely burro stood in the near corral. Strange indeed was the  silence brooding over the once happy, noisy home of Jane Withersteen's  pets.    He went into the corral, exercising care to leave no tracks, and led the  burro to the watering-trough. Venters, though not thirsty, drank till he  could drink no more. Then, leading the burro over hard ground, he struck  into the sage and down the slope.    He strode swiftly, turning from time to time to scan the slope for  riders. His head just topped the level of sage-brush, and the burro  could not have been seen at all. Slowly the green of Cottonwoods sank  behind the slope, and at last a wavering line of purple sage met the  blue of sky.    To avoid being seen, to get away, to hide his trail--these were the sole  ideas in his mind as he headed for Deception Pass, and he directed all  his acuteness of eye and ear, and the keenness of a rider's judgment for  distance and ground, to stern accomplishment of the task. He kept to the  sage far to the left of the trail leading into the Pass. He walked ten  miles and looked back a thousand times. Always the graceful, purple wave  of sage remained wide and lonely, a clear, undotted waste. Coming to a  stretch of rocky ground, he took advantage of it to cross the trail and  then continued down on the right. At length he persuaded himself that he  would be able to see riders mounted on horses before they could see him  on the little burro, and he rode bareback.    Hour by hour the tireless burro kept to his faithful, steady trot. The  sun sank and the long shadows lengthened down the slope. Moving veils of  purple twilight crept out of the hollows and, mustering and forming on  the levels, soon merged and shaded into night. Venters guided the  burro nearer to the trail, so that he could see its white line from the  ridges, and rode on through the hours.    Once down in the Pass without leaving a trail, he would hold himself  safe for the time being. When late in the night he reached the break in  the sage, he sent the burro down ahead of him, and started an avalanche  that all but buried the animal at the bottom of the trail. Bruised and  battered as he was, he had a moment's elation, for he had hidden his  tracks. Once more he mounted the burro and rode on. The hour was the  blackest of the night when he made the thicket which inclosed his old  camp. Here he turned the burro loose in the grass near the spring, and  then lay down on his old bed of leaves.    He felt only vaguely, as outside things, the ache and burn and throb  of the muscles of his body. But a dammed-up torrent of emotion at last  burst its bounds, and the hour that saw his release from immediate  action was one that confounded him in the reaction of his spirit. He  suffered without understanding why. He caught glimpses into himself,  into unlit darkness of soul. The fire that had blistered him and the  cold which had frozen him now united in one torturing possession of his  mind and heart, and like a fiery steed with ice-shod feet, ranged his  being, ran rioting through his blood, trampling the resurging good,  dragging ever at the evil.    Out of the subsiding chaos came a clear question. What had happened?  He had left the valley to go to Cottonwoods. Why? It seemed that he had  gone to kill a man--Oldring! The name riveted his consciousness upon the  one man of all men upon earth whom he had wanted to meet. He had met the  rustler. Venters recalled the smoky haze of the saloon, the dark-visaged  men, the huge Oldring. He saw him step out of the door, a splendid  specimen of manhood, a handsome giant with purple-black and sweeping  beard. He remembered inquisitive gaze of falcon eyes. He heard himself  repeating: “OLDRING, BESS IS ALIVE! BUT SHE'S DEAD TO YOU,” and he felt  himself jerk, and his ears throbbed to the thunder of a gun, and he  saw the giant sink slowly to his knees. Was that only the vitality  of him--that awful light in the eyes--only the hard-dying life of  a tremendously powerful brute? A broken whisper, strange as death:  “MAN--WHY--DIDN'T--YOU WAIT! BESS--WAS--” And Oldring plunged face  forward, dead.    “I killed him,” cried Venters, in remembering shock. “But it wasn't  THAT. Ah, the look in his eyes and his whisper!”    Herein lay the secret that had clamored to him through all the tumult  and stress of his emotions. What a look in the eyes of a man shot  through the heart! It had been neither hate nor ferocity nor fear of  men nor fear of death. It had been no passionate glinting spirit of a  fearless foe, willing shot for shot, life for life, but lacking physical  power. Distinctly recalled now, never to be forgotten, Venters saw  in Oldring's magnificent eyes the rolling of great, glad  surprise--softness--love! Then came a shadow and the terrible superhuman  striving of his spirit to speak. Oldring shot through the heart, had  fought and forced back death, not for a moment in which to shoot or  curse, but to whisper strange words.    What words for a dying man to whisper! Why had not Venters waited? For  what? That was no plea for life. It was regret that there was not a  moment of life left in which to speak. Bess was--Herein lay renewed  torture for Venters. What had Bess been to Oldring? The old question,  like a specter, stalked from its grave to haunt him. He had overlooked,  he had forgiven, he had loved and he had forgotten; and now, out of the  mystery of a dying man's whisper rose again that perverse, unsatisfied,  jealous uncertainty. Bess had loved that splendid, black-crowned  giant--by her own confession she had loved him; and in Venters's soul  again flamed up the jealous hell. Then into the clamoring hell burst the  shot that had killed Oldring, and it rang in a wild fiendish gladness,  a hateful, vengeful joy. That passed to the memory of the love and  light in Oldring's eyes and the mystery in his whisper. So the changing,  swaying emotions fluctuated in Venters's heart.    This was the climax of his year of suffering and the crucial struggle  of his life. And when the gray dawn came he rose, a gloomy, almost  heartbroken man, but victor over evil passions. He could not change the  past; and, even if he had not loved Bess with all his soul, he had grown  into a man who would not change the future he had planned for her. Only,  and once for all, he must know the truth, know the worst, stifle all  these insistent doubts and subtle hopes and jealous fancies, and kill  the past by knowing truly what Bess had been to Oldring. For that matter  he knew--he had always known, but he must hear it spoken. Then, when  they had safely gotten out of that wild country to take up a new and an  absorbing life, she would forget, she would be happy, and through that,  in the years to come, he could not but find life worth living.    All day he rode slowly and cautiously up the Pass, taking time to peer  around corners, to pick out hard ground and grassy patches, and to make  sure there was no one in pursuit. In the night sometime he came to the  smooth, scrawled rocks dividing the valley, and here set the burro at  liberty. He walked beyond, climbed the slope and the dim, starlit gorge.  Then, weary to the point of exhaustion, he crept into a shallow cave and  fell asleep.    In the morning, when he descended the trail, he found the sun was  pouring a golden stream of light through the arch of the great stone  bridge. Surprise Valley, like a valley of dreams, lay mystically soft  and beautiful, awakening to the golden flood which was rolling away its  slumberous bands of mist, brightening its walled faces.    While yet far off he discerned Bess moving under the silver spruces, and  soon the barking of the dogs told him that they had seen him. He heard  the mocking-birds singing in the trees, and then the twittering of the  quail. Ring and Whitie came bounding toward him, and behind them ran  Bess, her hands outstretched.    “Bern! You're back! You're back!” she cried, in joy that rang of her  loneliness.    “Yes, I'm back,” he said, as she rushed to meet him.    She had reached out for him when suddenly, as she saw him closely,  something checked her, and as quickly all her joy fled, and with it her  color, leaving her pale and trembling.    “Oh! What's happened?”    “A good deal has happened, Bess. I don't need to tell you what. And I'm  played out. Worn out in mind more than body.”    “Dear--you look strange to me!” faltered Bess.    “Never mind that. I'm all right. There's nothing for you to be scared  about. Things are going to turn out just as we have planned. As soon as  I'm rested we'll make a break to get out of the country. Only now, right  now, I must know the truth about you.”    “Truth about me?” echoed Bess, shrinkingly. She seemed to be casting  back into her mind for a forgotten key. Venters himself, as he saw her,  received a pang.    “Yes--the truth. Bess, don't misunderstand. I haven't changed that way.  I love you still. I'll love you more afterward. Life will be just as  sweet--sweeter to us. We'll be--be married as soon as ever we can. We'll  be happy--but there's a devil in me. A perverse, jealous devil! Then  I've queer fancies. I forgot for a long time. Now all those fiendish  little whispers of doubt and faith and fear and hope come torturing me  again. I've got to kill them with the truth.”    “I'll tell you anything you want to know,” she replied, frankly.    “Then by Heaven! we'll have it over and done with!... Bess--did Oldring  love you?”    “Certainly he did.”    “Did--did you love him?”    “Of course. I told you so.”    “How can you tell it so lightly?” cried Venters, passionately. “Haven't  you any sense of--of--” He choked back speech. He felt the rush of pain  and passion. He seized her in rude, strong hands and drew her close. He  looked straight into her dark-blue eyes. They were shadowing with the  old wistful light, but they were as clear as the limpid water of the  spring. They were earnest, solemn in unutterable love and faith and  abnegation. Venters shivered. He knew he was looking into her soul.  He knew she could not lie in that moment; but that she might tell the  truth, looking at him with those eyes, almost killed his belief in  purity.    “What are--what were you to--to Oldring?” he panted, fiercely.    “I am his daughter,” she replied, instantly.    Venters slowly let go of her. There was a violent break in the force of  his feeling--then creeping blankness.    “What--was it--you said?” he asked, in a kind of dull wonder.    “I am his daughter.”    “Oldring's daughter?” queried Venters, with life gathering in his voice.    “Yes.”    With a passionately awakening start he grasped her hands and drew her  close.    “All the time--you've been Oldring's daughter?”    “Yes, of course all the time--always.”    “But Bess, you told me--you let me think--I made out you were--a--so--so  ashamed.”    “It is my shame,” she said, with voice deep and full, and now the  scarlet fired her cheek. “I told you--I'm nothing--nameless--just Bess,  Oldring's girl!”    “I know--I remember. But I never thought--” he went on, hurriedly,  huskily. “That time--when you lay dying--you prayed--you--somehow I got  the idea you were bad.”    “Bad?” she asked, with a little laugh.    She looked up with a faint smile of bewilderment and the absolute  unconsciousness of a child. Venters gasped in the gathering might of the  truth. She did not understand his meaning.    “Bess! Bess!” He clasped her in his arms, hiding her eyes against his  breast. She must not see his face in that moment. And he held her while  he looked out across the valley. In his dim and blinded sight, in  the blur of golden light and moving mist, he saw Oldring. She was the  rustler's nameless daughter. Oldring had loved her. He had so guarded  her, so kept her from women and men and knowledge of life that her mind  was as a child's. That was part of the secret--part of the mystery.  That was the wonderful truth. Not only was she not bad, but good, pure,  innocent above all innocence in the world--the innocence of lonely  girlhood.    He saw Oldring's magnificent eyes, inquisitive, searching, softening. He  saw them flare in amaze, in gladness, with love, then suddenly strain in  terrible effort of will. He heard Oldring whisper and saw him sway like  a log and fall. Then a million bellowing, thundering voices--gunshots of  conscience, thunderbolts of remorse--dinned horribly in his ears. He had  killed Bess's father. Then a rushing wind filled his ears like a moan of  wind in the cliffs, a knell indeed--Oldring's knell.    He dropped to his knees and hid his face against Bess, and grasped her  with the hands of a drowning man.    “My God!... My God!... Oh, Bess!... Forgive me! Never mind what I've  done--what I've thought. But forgive me. I'll give you my life. I'll  live for you. I'll love you. Oh, I do love you as no man ever loved  a woman. I want you to know--to remember that I fought a fight for  you--however blind I was. I thought--I thought--never mind what I  thought--but I loved you--I asked you to marry me. Let that--let me have  that to hug to my heart. Oh, Bess, I was driven! And I might have known!  I could not rest nor sleep till I had this mystery solved. God! how  things work out!”    “Bern, you're weak--trembling--you talk wildly,” cried Bess. “You've  overdone your strength. There's nothing to forgive. There's no mystery  except your love for me. You have come back to me!”    And she clasped his head tenderly in her arms and pressed it closely to  her throbbing breast.        CHAPTER XIX. FAY    At the home of Jane Withersteen Little Fay was climbing Lassiter's knee.    “Does oo love me?” she asked.    Lassiter, who was as serious with Fay as he was gentle and loving,  assured her in earnest and elaborate speech that he was her devoted  subject. Fay looked thoughtful and appeared to be debating the duplicity  of men or searching for a supreme test to prove this cavalier.    “Does oo love my new muvver?” she asked, with bewildering suddenness.    Jane Withersteen laughed, and for the first time in many a day she felt  a stir of her pulse and warmth in her cheek.    It was a still drowsy summer of afternoon, and the three were sitting  in the shade of the wooded knoll that faced the sage-slope. Little Fay's  brief spell of unhappy longing for her mother--the childish, mystic  gloom--had passed, and now where Fay was there were prattle and laughter  and glee. She had emerged from sorrow to be the incarnation of joy and  loveliness. She had grown supernaturally sweet and beautiful. For Jane  Withersteen the child was an answer to prayer, a blessing, a possession  infinitely more precious than all she had lost. For Lassiter, Jane  divined that little Fay had become a religion.    “Does oo love my new muvver?” repeated Fay.    Lassiter's answer to this was a modest and sincere affirmative.    “Why don't oo marry my new muvver an' be my favver?”    Of the thousands of questions put by little Fay to Lassiter this was the  first he had been unable to answer.    “Fay--Fay, don't ask questions like that,” said Jane.    “Why?”    “Because,” replied Jane. And she found it strangely embarrassing to meet  the child's gaze. It seemed to her that Fay's violet eyes looked through  her with piercing wisdom.    “Oo love him, don't oo?”    “Dear child--run and play,” said Jane, “but don't go too far. Don't go  from this little hill.”    Fay pranced off wildly, joyous over freedom that had not been granted  her for weeks.    “Jane, why are children more sincere than grown-up persons?” asked  Lassiter.    “Are they?”    “I reckon so. Little Fay there--she sees things as they appear on the  face. An Indian does that. So does a dog. An' an Indian an' a dog are  most of the time right in what they see. Mebbe a child is always right.”    “Well, what does Fay see?” asked Jane.    “I reckon you know. I wonder what goes on in Fay's mind when she sees  part of the truth with the wise eyes of a child, an' wantin' to know  more, meets with strange falseness from you? Wait! You are false in a  way, though you're the best woman I ever knew. What I want to say is  this. Fay has taken you're pretendin' to--to care for me for the thing  it looks on the face. An' her little formin' mind asks questions. An'  the answers she gets are different from the looks of things. So she'll  grow up gradually takin' on that falseness, an' be like the rest of the  women, an' men, too. An' the truth of this falseness to life is proved  by your appearin' to love me when you don't. Things aren't what they  seem.”    “Lassiter, you're right. A child should be told the absolute truth.  But--is that possible? I haven't been able to do it, and all my life  I've loved the truth, and I've prided myself upon being truthful. Maybe  that was only egotism. I'm learning much, my friend. Some of those  blinding scales have fallen from my eyes. And--and as to caring for you,  I think I care a great deal. How much, how little, I couldn't say. My  heart is almost broken, Lassiter. So now is not a good time to judge of  affection. I can still play and be merry with Fay. I can still dream.  But when I attempt serious thought I'm dazed. I don't think. I don't  care any more. I don't pray!... Think of that, my friend! But in spite of  my numb feeling I believe I'll rise out of all this dark agony a better  woman, with greater love of man and God. I'm on the rack now; I'm  senseless to all but pain, and growing dead to that. Sooner or later I  shall rise out of this stupor. I'm waiting the hour.”    “It'll soon come, Jane,” replied Lassiter, soberly. “Then I'm afraid for  you. Years are terrible things, an' for years you've been bound.  Habit of years is strong as life itself. Somehow, though, I believe as  you--that you'll come out of it all a finer woman. I'm waitin', too. An'  I'm wonderin'--I reckon, Jane, that marriage between us is out of all  human reason?”    “Lassiter!... My dear friend!... It's impossible for us to marry!”    “Why--as Fay says?” inquired Lassiter, with gentle persistence.    “Why! I never thought why. But it's not possible. I am Jane, daughter of  Withersteen. My father would rise out of his grave. I'm of Mormon  birth. I'm being broken. But I'm still a Mormon woman. And you--you are  Lassiter!”    “Mebbe I'm not so much Lassiter as I used to be.”    “What was it you said? Habit of years is strong as life itself! You  can't change the one habit--the purpose of your life. For you still pack  those black guns! You still nurse your passion for blood.”    A smile, like a shadow, flickered across his face.    “No.”    “Lassiter, I lied to you. But I beg of you--don't you lie to me. I've  great respect for you. I believe you're softened toward most, perhaps  all, my people except--But when I speak of your purpose, your hate, your  guns, I have only him in mind. I don't believe you've changed.”    For answer he unbuckled the heavy cartridge-belt, and laid it with the  heavy, swing gun-sheaths in her lap.    “Lassiter!” Jane whispered, as she gazed from him to the black, cold  guns. Without them he appeared shorn of strength, defenseless, a smaller  man. Was she Delilah? Swiftly, conscious of only one motive--refusal to  see this man called craven by his enemies--she rose, and with blundering  fingers buckled the belt round his waist where it belonged.    “Lassiter, I am a coward.”    “Come with me out of Utah--where I can put away my guns an' be a man,”   he said. “I reckon I'll prove it to you then! Come! You've got Black  Star back, an' Night an' Bells. Let's take the racers an' little Fay,  en' race out of Utah. The hosses an' the child are all you have left.  Come!”    “No, no, Lassiter. I'll never leave Utah. What would I do in the world  with my broken fortunes and my broken heart? I'll never leave these  purple slopes I love so well.”    “I reckon I ought to 've knowed that. Presently you'll be livin' down  here in a hovel, en' presently Jane Withersteen will be a memory. I only  wanted to have a chance to show you how a man--any man--can be better 'n  he was. If we left Utah I could prove--I reckon I could prove this  thing you call love. It's strange, an' hell an' heaven at once, Jane  Withersteen. 'Pears to me that you've thrown away your big heart on  love--love of religion an' duty an' churchmen, an' riders an' poor  families an' poor children! Yet you can't see what love is--how it  changes a person!... Listen, an' in tellin' you Milly Erne's story I'll  show you how love changed her.    “Milly an' me was children when our family moved from Missouri to Texas,  an' we growed up in Texas ways same as if we'd been born there. We had  been poor, an' there we prospered. In time the little village where we  went became a town, an' strangers an' new families kept movin' in. Milly  was the belle them days. I can see her now, a little girl no bigger 'n  a bird, an' as pretty. She had the finest eyes, dark blue-black when she  was excited, an' beautiful all the time. You remember Milly's eyes! An'  she had light-brown hair with streaks of gold, an' a mouth that every  feller wanted to kiss.    “An' about the time Milly was the prettiest an' the sweetest, along came  a young minister who began to ride some of a race with the other fellers  for Milly. An' he won. Milly had always been strong on religion, an'  when she met Frank Erne she went in heart an' soul for the salvation of  souls. Fact was, Milly, through study of the Bible an' attendin' church  an' revivals, went a little out of her head. It didn't worry the old  folks none, an' the only worry to me was Milly's everlastin' prayin' an'  workin' to save my soul. She never converted me, but we was the best  of comrades, an' I reckon no brother an' sister ever loved each other  better. Well, Frank Erne an me hit up a great friendship. He was a  strappin' feller, good to look at, an' had the most pleasin' ways. His  religion never bothered me, for he could hunt an' fish an' ride an' be a  good feller. After buffalo once, he come pretty near to savin' my life.  We got to be thick as brothers, an' he was the only man I ever seen who  I thought was good enough for Milly. An' the day they were married I got  drunk for the only time in my life.    “Soon after that I left home--it seems Milly was the only one who could  keep me home--an' I went to the bad, as to prosperin' I saw some pretty  hard life in the Pan Handle, an' then I went North. In them days Kansas  an' Nebraska was as bad, come to think of it, as these days right here  on the border of Utah. I got to be pretty handy with guns. An'  there wasn't many riders as could beat me ridin'. An' I can say all  modest-like that I never seen the white man who could track a hoss or a  steer or a man with me. Afore I knowed it two years slipped by, an' all  at once I got homesick, en' purled a bridle south.    “Things at home had changed. I never got over that homecomin'. Mother  was dead an' in her grave. Father was a silent, broken man, killed  already on his feet. Frank Erne was a ghost of his old self, through  with workin', through with preachin', almost through with livin', an'  Milly was gone!... It was a long time before I got the story. Father had  no mind left, an' Frank Erne was afraid to talk. So I had to pick up  whet 'd happened from different people.    “It 'pears that soon after I left home another preacher come to the  little town. An' he an' Frank become rivals. This feller was different  from Frank. He preached some other kind of religion, and he was quick  an' passionate, where Frank was slow an' mild. He went after people,  women specially. In looks he couldn't compare to Frank Erne, but he had  power over women. He had a voice, an' he talked an' talked an' preached  an' preached. Milly fell under his influence. She became mightily  interested in his religion. Frank had patience with her, as was his way,  an' let her be as interested as she liked. All religions were devoted to  one God, he said, an' it wouldn't hurt Milly none to study a different  point of view. So the new preacher often called on Milly, an' sometimes  in Frank's absence. Frank was a cattle-man between Sundays.    “Along about this time an incident come off that I couldn't get much  light on. A stranger come to town, an' was seen with the preacher. This  stranger was a big man with an eye like blue ice, an' a beard of gold.  He had money, an' he 'peered a man of mystery, an' the town went to  buzzin' when he disappeared about the same time as a young woman  known to be mightily interested in the new preacher's religion. Then,  presently, along comes a man from somewheres in Illinois, en' he up an'  spots this preacher as a famous Mormon proselyter. That riled Frank Erne  as nothin' ever before, an' from rivals they come to be bitter enemies.  An' it ended in Frank goin' to the meetin'-house where Milly  was listenin', en' before her en' everybody else he called that  preacher--called him, well, almost as hard as Venters called Tull here  sometime back. An' Frank followed up that call with a hosswhippin', en'  he drove the proselyter out of town.    “People noticed, so 'twas said, that Milly's sweet disposition changed.  Some said it was because she would soon become a mother, en' others  said she was pinin' after the new religion. An' there was women who  said right out that she was pinin' after the Mormon. Anyway, one mornin'  Frank rode in from one of his trips, to find Milly gone. He had no real  near neighbors--livin' a little out of town--but those who was nearest  said a wagon had gone by in the night, an' they thought it stopped at her  door. Well, tracks always tell, an' there was the wagon tracks an' hoss  tracks an' man tracks. The news spread like wildfire that Milly had run  off from her husband. Everybody but Frank believed it an' wasn't slow in  tellin' why she run off. Mother had always hated that strange streak of  Milly's, takin' up with the new religion as she had, an' she believed  Milly ran off with the Mormon. That hastened mother's death, an' she  died unforgivin'. Father wasn't the kind to bow down under disgrace or  misfortune but he had surpassin' love for Milly, an' the loss of her  broke him.    “From the minute I heard of Milly's disappearance I never believed she  went off of her own free will. I knew Milly, an' I knew she couldn't  have done that. I stayed at home awhile, tryin' to make Frank Erne talk.  But if he knowed anythin' then he wouldn't tell it. So I set out to find  Milly. An' I tried to get on the trail of that proselyter. I knew if I  ever struck a town he'd visited that I'd get a trail. I knew, too, that  nothin' short of hell would stop his proselytin'. An' I rode from town  to town. I had a blind faith that somethin' was guidin' me. An' as the  weeks an' months went by I growed into a strange sort of a man, I guess.  Anyway, people were afraid of me. Two years after that, way over in a  corner of Texas, I struck a town where my man had been. He'd jest left.  People said he came to that town without a woman. I back-trailed my man  through Arkansas an' Mississippi, an' the old trail got hot again in  Texas. I found the town where he first went after leavin' home. An' here  I got track of Milly. I found a cabin where she had given birth to her  baby. There was no way to tell whether she'd been kept a prisoner or  not. The feller who owned the place was a mean, silent sort of a skunk,  an' as I was leavin' I jest took a chance an' left my mark on him. Then  I went home again.    “It was to find I hadn't any home, no more. Father had been dead a year.  Frank Erne still lived in the house where Milly had left him. I stayed  with him awhile, an' I grew old watchin' him. His farm had gone to weed,  his cattle had strayed or been rustled, his house weathered till it  wouldn't keep out rain nor wind. An' Frank set on the porch and whittled  sticks, an' day by day wasted away. There was times when he ranted about  like a crazy man, but mostly he was always sittin' an' starin' with eyes  that made a man curse. I figured Frank had a secret fear that I needed  to know. An' when I told him I'd trailed Milly for near three years an'  had got trace of her, an' saw where she'd had her baby, I thought he  would drop dead at my feet. An' when he'd come round more natural-like  he begged me to give up the trail. But he wouldn't explain. So I let him  alone, an' watched him day en' night.    “An' I found there was one thing still precious to him, an' it was a  little drawer where he kept his papers. This was in the room where he  slept. An' it 'peered he seldom slept. But after bein' patient I got the  contents of that drawer an' found two letters from Milly. One was a long  letter written a few months after her disappearance. She had been bound  an' gagged an' dragged away from her home by three men, an' she named  them--Hurd, Metzger, Slack. They was strangers to her. She was taken  to the little town where I found trace of her two years after. But she  didn't send the letter from that town. There she was penned in. 'Peared  that the proselytes, who had, of course, come on the scene, was not  runnin' any risks of losin' her. She went on to say that for a time  she was out of her head, an' when she got right again all that kept  her alive was the baby. It was a beautiful baby, she said, an' all she  thought an' dreamed of was somehow to get baby back to its father, an'  then she'd thankfully lay down and die. An' the letter ended abrupt, in  the middle of a sentence, en' it wasn't signed.    “The second letter was written more than two years after the first. It  was from Salt Lake City. It simply said that Milly had heard her brother  was on her trail. She asked Frank to tell her brother to give up the  search because if he didn't she would suffer in a way too horrible  to tell. She didn't beg. She just stated a fact an' made the simple  request. An' she ended that letter by sayin' she would soon leave Salt  Lake City with the man she had come to love, en' would never be heard of  again.    “I recognized Milly's handwritin', an' I recognized her way of puttin'  things. But that second letter told me of some great change in her.  Ponderin' over it, I felt at last she'd either come to love that feller  an' his religion, or some terrible fear made her lie an' say so. I  couldn't be sure which. But, of course, I meant to find out. I'll say  here, if I'd known Mormons then as I do now I'd left Milly to her fate.  For mebbe she was right about what she'd suffer if I kept on her trail.  But I was young an' wild them days. First I went to the town where she'd  first been taken, an' I went to the place where she'd been kept. I got  that skunk who owned the place, an' took him out in the woods, an' made  him tell all he knowed. That wasn't much as to length, but it was pure  hell's-fire in substance. This time I left him some incapacitated for  any more skunk work short of hell. Then I hit the trail for Utah.    “That was fourteen years ago. I saw the incomin' of most of the Mormons.  It was a wild country an' a wild time. I rode from town to town, village  to village, ranch to ranch, camp to camp. I never stayed long in one  place. I never had but one idea. I never rested. Four years went by, an'  I knowed every trail in northern Utah. I kept on an' as time went by,  an' I'd begun to grow old in my search, I had firmer, blinder faith in  whatever was guidin' me. Once I read about a feller who sailed the seven  seas an' traveled the world, an' he had a story to tell, an' whenever he  seen the man to whom he must tell that story he knowed him on sight. I  was like that, only I had a question to ask. An' always I knew the man  of whom I must ask. So I never really lost the trail, though for many  years it was the dimmest trail ever followed by any man.    “Then come a change in my luck. Along in Central Utah I rounded up Hurd,  an' I whispered somethin' in his ear, an' watched his face, an' then  throwed a gun against his bowels. An' he died with his teeth so tight  shut I couldn't have pried them open with a knife. Slack an' Metzger  that same year both heard me whisper the same question, an' neither  would they speak a word when they lay dyin'. Long before I'd learned  no man of this breed or class--or God knows what--would give up any  secrets! I had to see in a man's fear of death the connections with  Milly Erne's fate. An' as the years passed at long intervals I would  find such a man.    “So as I drifted on the long trail down into southern Utah my name  preceded me, an' I had to meet a people prepared for me, an' ready with  guns. They made me a gun-man. An' that suited me. In all this time signs  of the proselyter an' the giant with the blue-ice eyes an' the gold  beard seemed to fade dimmer out of the trail. Only twice in ten years  did I find a trace of that mysterious man who had visited the proselyter  at my home village. What he had to do with Milly's fate was beyond all  hope for me to learn, unless my guidin' spirit led me to him! As for  the other man, I knew, as sure as I breathed en' the stars shone en' the  wind blew, that I'd meet him some day.    “Eighteen years I've been on the trail. An' it led me to the last lonely  villages of the Utah border. Eighteen years!... I feel pretty old now. I  was only twenty when I hit that trail. Well, as I told you, back here a  ways a Gentile said Jane Withersteen could tell me about Milly Erne an'  show me her grave!”    The low voice ceased, and Lassiter slowly turned his sombrero round and  round, and appeared to be counting the silver ornaments on the band.  Jane, leaning toward him, sat as if petrified, listening intently,  waiting to hear more. She could have shrieked, but power of tongue and  lips were denied her. She saw only this sad, gray, passion-worn man, and  she heard only the faint rustling of the leaves.    “Well, I came to Cottonwoods,” went on Lassiter, “an' you showed me  Milly's grave. An' though your teeth have been shut tighter 'n them of  all the dead men lyin' back along that trail, jest the same you told me  the secret I've lived these eighteen years to hear! Jane, I said you'd  tell me without ever me askin'. I didn't need to ask my question here.  The day, you remember, when that fat party throwed a gun on me in your  court, an'--”    “Oh! Hush!” whispered Jane, blindly holding up her hands.    “I seen in your face that Dyer, now a bishop, was the proselyter who  ruined Milly Erne.”    For an instant Jane Withersteen's brain was a whirling chaos and she  recovered to find herself grasping at Lassiter like one drowning. And as  if by a lightning stroke she sprang from her dull apathy into exquisite  torture.    “It's a lie! Lassiter! No, no!” she moaned. “I swear--you're wrong!”    “Stop! You'd perjure yourself! But I'll spare you that. You poor woman!  Still blind! Still faithful!... Listen. I know. Let that settle it. An' I  give up my purpose!”    “What is it--you say?”    “I give up my purpose. I've come to see an' feel differently. I can't  help poor Milly. An' I've outgrowed revenge. I've come to see I can be  no judge for men. I can't kill a man jest for hate. Hate ain't the same  with me since I loved you and little Fay.”    “Lassiter! You mean you won't kill him?” Jane whispered.    “No.”    “For my sake?”    “I reckon. I can't understand, but I'll respect your feelin's.”    “Because you--oh, because you love me?... Eighteen years! You were that  terrible Lassiter! And now--because you love me?”    “That's it, Jane.”    “Oh, you'll make me love you! How can I help but love you? My heart must  be stone. But--oh, Lassiter, wait, wait! Give me time. I'm not what I  was. Once it was so easy to love. Now it's easy to hate. Wait! My faith  in God--some God--still lives. By it I see happier times for you, poor  passion-swayed wanderer! For me--a miserable, broken woman. I loved your  sister Milly. I will love you. I can't have fallen so low--I can't be  so abandoned by God--that I've no love left to give you. Wait! Let us  forget Milly's sad life. Ah, I knew it as no one else on earth! There's  one thing I shall tell you--if you are at my death-bed, but I can't  speak now.”    “I reckon I don't want to hear no more,” said Lassiter.    Jane leaned against him, as if some pent-up force had rent its way  out, she fell into a paroxysm of weeping. Lassiter held her in silent  sympathy. By degrees she regained composure, and she was rising,  sensible of being relieved of a weighty burden, when a sudden start on  Lassiter's part alarmed her.    “I heard hosses--hosses with muffled hoofs!” he said; and he got up  guardedly.    “Where's Fay?” asked Jane, hurriedly glancing round the shady knoll. The  bright-haired child, who had appeared to be close all the time, was not  in sight.    “Fay!” called Jane.    No answering shout of glee. No patter of flying feet. Jane saw Lassiter  stiffen.    “Fay--oh--Fay!” Jane almost screamed.    The leaves quivered and rustled; a lonesome cricket chirped in the  grass, a bee hummed by. The silence of the waning afternoon breathed  hateful portent. It terrified Jane. When had silence been so infernal?    “She's--only--strayed--out--of earshot,” faltered Jane, looking at  Lassiter.    Pale, rigid as a statue, the rider stood, not in listening, searching  posture, but in one of doomed certainty. Suddenly he grasped Jane with  an iron hand, and, turning his face from her gaze, he strode with her  from the knoll.    “See--Fay played here last--a house of stones an' sticks.... An' here's  a corral of pebbles with leaves for hosses,” said Lassiter, stridently,  and pointed to the ground. “Back an' forth she trailed here.... See,  she's buried somethin'--a dead grasshopper--there's a tombstone... here  she went, chasin' a lizard--see the tiny streaked trail... she pulled  bark off this cottonwood... look in the dust of the path--the letters you  taught her--she's drawn pictures of birds en' hosses an' people.... Look,  a cross! Oh, Jane, your cross!”    Lassiter dragged Jane on, and as if from a book read the meaning of  little Fay's trail. All the way down the knoll, through the shrubbery,  round and round a cottonwood, Fay's vagrant fancy left records of her  sweet musings and innocent play. Long had she lingered round a bird-nest  to leave therein the gaudy wing of a butterfly. Long had she played  beside the running stream sending adrift vessels freighted with pebbly  cargo. Then she had wandered through the deep grass, her tiny feet  scarcely turning a fragile blade, and she had dreamed beside some old  faded flowers. Thus her steps led her into the broad lane. The little  dimpled imprints of her bare feet showed clean-cut in the dust they went  a little way down the lane; and then, at a point where they stopped, the  great tracks of a man led out from the shrubbery and returned.        CHAPTER XX. LASSITER'S WAY    Footprints told the story of little Fay's abduction. In anguish Jane  Withersteen turned speechlessly to Lassiter, and, confirming her fears,  she saw him gray-faced, aged all in a moment, stricken as if by a mortal  blow.    Then all her life seemed to fall about her in wreck and ruin.    “It's all over,” she heard her voice whisper. “It's ended. I'm  going--I'm going--”    “Where?” demanded Lassiter, suddenly looming darkly over her.    “To--to those cruel men--”    “Speak names!” thundered Lassiter.    “To Bishop Dyer--to Tull,” went on Jane, shocked into obedience.    “Well--what for?”    “I want little Fay. I can't live without her. They've stolen her as they  stole Milly Erne's child. I must have little Fay. I want only her. I  give up. I'll go and tell Bishop Dyer--I'm broken. I'll tell him I'm  ready for the yoke--only give me back Fay--and--and I'll marry Tull!”    “Never!” hissed Lassiter.    His long arm leaped at her. Almost running, he dragged her under the  cottonwoods, across the court, into the huge hall of Withersteen House,  and he shut the door with a force that jarred the heavy walls. Black  Star and Night and Bells, since their return, had been locked in this  hall, and now they stamped on the stone floor.    Lassiter released Jane and like a dizzy man swayed from her with a  hoarse cry and leaned shaking against a table where he kept his rider's  accoutrements. He began to fumble in his saddlebags. His action brought  a clinking, metallic sound--the rattling of gun-cartridges. His fingers  trembled as he slipped cartridges into an extra belt. But as he buckled  it over the one he habitually wore his hands became steady. This second  belt contained two guns, smaller than the black ones swinging low, and  he slipped them round so that his coat hid them. Then he fell to swift  action. Jane Withersteen watched him, fascinated but uncomprehending and  she saw him rapidly saddle Black Star and Night. Then he drew her into  the light of the huge windows, standing over her, gripping her arm with  fingers like cold steel.    “Yes, Jane, it's ended--but you're not goin' to Dyer!... I'm goin'  instead!”    Looking at him--he was so terrible of aspect--she could not comprehend  his words. Who was this man with the face gray as death, with eyes  that would have made her shriek had she the strength, with the strange,  ruthlessly bitter lips? Where was the gentle Lassiter? What was this  presence in the hall, about him, about her--this cold, invisible  presence?    “Yes, it's ended, Jane,” he was saying, so awfully quiet and cool and  implacable, “an' I'm goin' to make a little call. I'll lock you in here,  an' when I get back have the saddle-bags full of meat an bread. An' be  ready to ride!”    “Lassiter!” cried Jane.    Desperately she tried to meet his gray eyes, in vain, desperately she  tried again, fought herself as feeling and thought resurged in torment,  and she succeeded, and then she knew.    “No--no--no!” she wailed. “You said you'd foregone your vengeance. You  promised not to kill Bishop Dyer.”    “If you want to talk to me about him--leave off the Bishop. I don't  understand that name, or its use.”    “Oh, hadn't you foregone your vengeance on--on Dyer?    “Yes.”    “But--your actions--your words--your guns--your terrible looks!... They  don't seem foregoing vengeance?”    “Jane, now it's justice.”    “You'll--kill him?”    “If God lets me live another hour! If not God--then the devil who drives  me!”    “You'll kill him--for yourself--for your vengeful hate?”    “No!”    “For Milly Erne's sake?”    “No.”    “For little Fay's?”    “No!”    “Oh--for whose?”    “For yours!”    “His blood on my soul!” whispered Jane, and she fell to her knees.  This was the long-pending hour of fruition. And the habit of years--the  religious passion of her life--leaped from lethargy, and the long months  of gradual drifting to doubt were as if they had never been. “If you  spill his blood it'll be on my soul--and on my father's. Listen.”   And she clasped his knees, and clung there as he tried to raise her.  “Listen. Am I nothing to you?”    “Woman--don't trifle at words! I love you! An' I'll soon prove it.”    “I'll give myself to you--I'll ride away with you--marry you, if only  you'll spare him?”    His answer was a cold, ringing, terrible laugh.    “Lassiter--I'll love you. Spare him!”    “No.”    She sprang up in despairing, breaking spirit, and encircled his neck  with her arms, and held him in an embrace that he strove vainly to  loosen. “Lassiter, would you kill me? I'm fighting my last fight for  the principles of my youth--love of religion, love of father. You don't  know--you can't guess the truth, and I can't speak ill. I'm losing  all. I'm changing. All I've gone through is nothing to this hour. Pity  me--help me in my weakness. You're strong again--oh, so cruelly, coldly  strong! You're killing me. I see you--feel you as some other Lassiter!  My master, be merciful--spare him!”    His answer was a ruthless smile.    She clung the closer to him, and leaned her panting breast on him, and  lifted her face to his. “Lassiter, I do love you! It's leaped out of my  agony. It comes suddenly with a terrible blow of truth. You are a man!  I never knew it till now. Some wonderful change came to me when you  buckled on these guns and showed that gray, awful face. I loved you  then. All my life I've loved, but never as now. No woman can love like  a broken woman. If it were not for one thing--just one thing--and yet! I  can't speak it--I'd glory in your manhood--the lion in you that means to  slay for me. Believe me--and spare Dyer. Be merciful--great as it's in  you to be great.... Oh, listen and believe--I have nothing, but I'm a  woman--a beautiful woman, Lassiter--a passionate, loving woman--and I  love you! Take me--hide me in some wild place--and love me and mend my  broken heart. Spare him and take me away.”    She lifted her face closer and closer to his, until their lips nearly  touched, and she hung upon his neck, and with strength almost spent  pressed and still pressed her palpitating body to his.    “Kiss me!” she whispered, blindly.    “No--not at your price!” he answered. His voice had changed or she had  lost clearness of hearing.    “Kiss me!... Are you a man? Kiss me and save me!”    “Jane, you never played fair with me. But now you're blisterin' your  lips--blackenin' your soul with lies!”    “By the memory of my mother--by my Bible--no! No, I have no Bible! But  by my hope of heaven I swear I love you!”    Lassiter's gray lips formed soundless words that meant even her love  could not avail to bend his will. As if the hold of her arms was that of  a child's he loosened it and stepped away.    “Wait! Don't go! Oh, hear a last word!... May a more just and merciful  God than the God I was taught to worship judge me--forgive me--save me!  For I can no longer keep silent!... Lassiter, in pleading for Dyer I've  been pleading more for my father. My father was a Mormon master, close  to the leaders of the church. It was my father who sent Dyer out to  proselyte. It was my father who had the blue-ice eye and the beard of  gold. It was my father you got trace of in the past years. Truly, Dyer  ruined Milly Erne--dragged her from her home--to Utah--to Cottonwoods.  But it was for my father! If Milly Erne was ever wife of a Mormon that  Mormon was my father! I never knew--never will know whether or not she  was a wife. Blind I may be, Lassiter--fanatically faithful to a false  religion I may have been but I know justice, and my father is beyond  human justice. Surely he is meeting just punishment--somewhere. Always  it has appalled me--the thought of your killing Dyer for my father's  sins. So I have prayed!”    “Jane, the past is dead. In my love for you I forgot the past. This  thing I'm about to do ain't for myself or Milly or Fay. It's not because  of anythin' that ever happened in the past, but for what is happenin'  right now. It's for you!... An' listen. Since I was a boy I've never  thanked God for anythin'. If there is a God--an' I've come to believe  it--I thank Him now for the years that made me Lassiter!... I can reach  down en' feel these big guns, en' know what I can do with them. An',  Jane, only one of the miracles Dyer professes to believe in can save  him!”    Again for Jane Withersteen came the spinning of her brain in darkness,  and as she whirled in endless chaos she seemed to be falling at the feet  of a luminous figure--a man--Lassiter--who had saved her from herself,  who could not be changed, who would slay rightfully. Then she slipped  into utter blackness.    When she recovered from her faint she became aware that she was lying on  a couch near the window in her sitting-room. Her brow felt damp and cold  and wet, some one was chafing her hands; she recognized Judkins, and  then saw that his lean, hard face wore the hue and look of excessive  agitation.    “Judkins!” Her voice broke weakly.    “Aw, Miss Withersteen, you're comin' round fine. Now jest lay still a  little. You're all right; everythin's all right.”    “Where is--he?”    “Who?”    “Lassiter!”    “You needn't worry none about him.”    “Where is he? Tell me--instantly.”    “Wal, he's in the other room patchin' up a few triflin' bullet holes.”    “Ah!... Bishop' Dyer?”    “When I seen him last--a matter of half an hour ago, he was on his  knees. He was some busy, but he wasn't prayin'",69.11,8.5,8.3,7.72,9.5,5.49,2073,4.2727272727272725,9.92,7th and 8th grade
3,The Scapegoatr,"“Naomi, Naomi,” whispered Fatimah in the girl's ear, “we are going home.  Come, dearest, come.”    But Naomi was not to be moved. No gentle voice availed to stir her.  She stood where she had placed herself on the outskirts of the crowd,  motionless save for her heaving bosom and trembling limbs, and silent  save for her loud breathing and the low muttering of her pale lips, yet  listening eagerly with her neck outstretched.    And if, as she listened, any human eye could have looked in on her  dumb and imprisoned soul, the tumult it would have seen must have been  terrible. For, though no one knew it as a certainty, yet in her darkness  and muteness since the coming of her gift of hearing she had been  learning speech and the different voices of men. All that was spoken in  that crowd she understood, and never a word escaped her, and what others  saw she felt, only nearer and more terrible, because wrapped in the  darkness outside her eyes that were blind.    First there came a lull in the general clamour, and then a coarse,  jarring, stridulous voice rose in the air. Naomi knew whose voice it  was--it was the voice of old Abraham Pigman, the usurer.    “Brothers of Tetuan,” the old man cried, “what are we waiting for? For  the verdict of the judges? Who wants their verdict? There is only one  thing to do. Let us ask the Kaid to remove this man. The Kaid is a  humane master. If he has sometimes worked wrong by us, he has been  driven to do that which in his soul he abhors. Let us go to him and say:  'Lord Basha, through five-and-twenty years this man of our people has  stood over us to oppress us, and your servants have suffered and been  silent. In that time we have seen the seed of Israel hunted from the  houses of their fathers where they have lived since their birth. We have  seen them buffeted and smitten, without a resting-place for the soles  of their feet, and perishing in hunger and thirst and nakedness and  the want of all things. Is this to your honour, or your glory, or your  profit?'”    The people broke into loud cries of approval, and when they were once  more silent, the thick voice went on: “And not the seed of Israel  only, but the sons of Islam also, has this man plunged in the depths of  misery. Under a Sultan who desires liberty and a Kaid who loves justice,  in a land that breathes freedom and a city that is favoured of God,  our brethren the Muslimeen sink with us in deep mire where there is no  standing. Every day brings to both its burden of fresh sorrow. At  this moment a plague is upon us. The country is bare; the town is  overflowing; every man stumbles over his fellow our lives hang in doubt;  in the morning we say 'Would it were evening'; in the evening we say,  'Would it were morning'; stretch out your hand and help us!”    Again the crowd burst into shouts of assent, and the stridulous voice  continued: “Let us say to him 'Lord Basha, there is no way of help but  one. Pluck down this man that is set over us. He belongs to our own race  and nation; but give us a master of any other race and nation; any Moor,  any Arab, any Berber, any negro; only take back this man of our own  people, and your servants will bless you.'”    The old man's voice was drowned in great shouts of “Ben Aboo!” “To Ben  Aboo!” “Why wait for the judges?” “To the Kasbah!” “The Kasbah!”    But a second voice came piercing through the boom and clash of those  waves of sound, and it was thin and shrill as the cry of a pea-hen.  Naomi knew this voice also--it was the voice of Judah ben Lolo,  the elder of the synagogue, who would have been sitting among the  three-and-twenty-judges but that he was a usurer also.    “Why go to the Kaid?” said the voice like a peahen. “Does the Basha  love this Israel ben Oliel? Has he of late given many signs of such  affection? Bethink you, brothers, and act wisely! Would not Ben Aboo  be glad to have done with this servant who has been so long his master?  Then why trouble him with your grievance? Act for yourselves, and the  Kaid will thank you! And well may this Israel ben Oliel praise the Lord  and worship Him, that He has not put it into the hearts of His people  to play the game of breaker of tyrants by the spilling of blood, as the  races around them, the Arabs and the Berbers, who are of a temper more  warm by nature, must long ago have done, and that not unjustly either,  or altogether to the displeasure of a Kaid who is good and humane and  merciful, and has never loved that his poor people should be oppressed.”    At this word, though it made pretence to commend the temperance of the  crowd, the fury broke out more loudly than before. “Away with the man!”   “Away with him!” rang out on every side in countless voices, husky and  clear, gruff and sharp, piping and deep. Not a voice of them all called  for mercy or for patience.    While the anger of the people surged and broke in the air, a third voice  came through the tumult, and Naomi knew it, for it was the harsh voice  of Reuben Maliki, the silversmith and keeper of the poor-box.    “And does God,” said Reuben, “any more than Ben Aboo--blessings on his  life!--love that His people should be oppressed? How has He dealt with  this Israel ben Oliel? Does He stand steadfastly beside him, or has His  hand gone out against him? Since the day he came here, five-and-twenty  years ago, has God saved him or smitten him? Remember Ruth, his wife,  how she died young! Remember her father, our old Grand Rabbi, David ben  Ohana, how the hand of the Lord fell upon him on the night of the  day whereon his daughter was married! Remember this girl Naomi, this  offspring of sin, this accursed and afflicted one, still blind and  speechless!”    Then the voices of the crowd came to Naomi's ears like the neigh of a  breathless horse. Fatimah had laid hold of her gown and was whispering.  “Come! Let us away!” But Naomi only clutched her hand and trembled.    The harsh voice of Reuben Maliki rose in the air again. “Do you say that  the Lord gave him riches? Behold him!--he swallowed them down, but has  he not vomited them up? Examine him!--that which he took by extortions  has he not been made to restore? Does God's anger smoke against him?  Answer me, yes or no!”    Like a bolt out of the sky there came a great shout of “Yes!” And  instantly afterwards, from another direction, there came a fourth voice,  a peevish, tremulous voice, the voice of an old woman. Naomi knew it--it  was the voice of Rebecca Bensabott, ninety-and-odd years of age, and  still deaf as a stone.    “Tut! What is all this talking about?” she snapped and grunted. “Reuben  Maliki, save your wind for your widows--you don't give them too much of  it. And, Abraham Pigman, go home to your money-bags. I am an old fool,  am I? Well, I've the more right to speak plain. What are we waiting here  for? The judges? Pooh! The sentence? Fiddle-faddle! It is Israel ben  Oliel, isn't it? Then stone him! What are you afraid of? The Kaid? He'll  laugh in your faces. A blood-feud? Who is to wage it? A ransom? Who is  to ask for it? Only this mute, this Naomi, and you'll have to work her  a miracle and find her a tongue first. Out on you! Men? Pshaw! You are  children!”    The people laughed--it was the hard, grating, hollow laugh that sets the  teeth on edge behind the lips that utter it. Instantly the voices of the  crowd broke up into a discordant clangour, like to the counter-currents  of an angry sea. “She's right,” said a shrill voice. “He deserves it,”   snuffled a nasal one. “At least let us drive him out of the town,” said  a third gruff voice. “To his house!” cried a fourth voice, that pealed  over all. “To his house!” came then from countless hungry throats.    “Come, let us go,” whispered Fatimah to Naomi, and again she laid hold  of her arm to force her away. But Naomi shook off her hand, and muttered  strange sounds to herself.    “To his house! Sack it! Drive the tyrant out!” the people howled in a  hundred rasping voices; but, before any one had stirred, a man riding a  mule had forced his way into the middle of the crowd.    It was the messenger from under the Mellah gate. In their new frenzy the  people had forgotten him. He had come to make known the decision of the  Synhedrin. The flag had fallen; the sentence was death.    Hearing this doom, the people heard no more, and neither did they wait  for the procession of the judges, that they might learn of the means  whereby they, who were not masters in their own house, might carry  the sentence into effect. The procession was even then forming. It  was coming out of the synagogue; it was passing under the gate of the  Mellah; it was approaching the Sok el Foki. The Rabbis walked in front  of it. At its tail came four Moors with shamefaced looks. They were  the soldiers and muleteers whom Israel had hired when he set out on his  pilgrimage to that enemy of all Kaids and Bashas, Mohammed of Mequinez.  By-and-by they were to betray him to Ben Aboo.    But no one saw either Rabbis or Moors. The people were twisting and  turning like worms on an upturned turf. “Why sack his house?” cried  some. “Why drive him out?” cried others. “A poor revenge!” “Kill him!”   “Kill him!”    At the sound of that word, never before spoken, though every ear had  waited for it, the shouts of the crowd rose to madness. But suddenly  in the midst of the wild vociferations there was a shrill cry of “He is  there!” and then there was a great silence.    It was Israel himself. He was coming afoot down the lane under the town  walls from the gate called the Bab Toot, where the road comes in from  Shawan. At fifty paces behind him Ali, the black boy, was riding one  mule and leading another.    He was returning from the prison, and thinking how the poor followers  of Absalam, after he had fed them of his poverty, had blest him out  of their dry throats, saying, “May the God of Jacob bless you also,  brother!” and “May the child of your wife be blessed!” Ah! those  blessings, he could hear them still! They followed him as he walked.  He did not fly from them any longer, for they sang in his ears and were  like music in his melted soul. Once before he had heard such music.  It was in England. The organ swelled and the voices rose, and he was a  lonely boy, for his mother lay in her grave at his feet. His mother! How  strangely his heart was softened towards himself and-all the world And  Ruth! He could think of nothing without tenderness. And Naomi! Ah! the  sun was nigh two hours down, and Naomi would be waiting for him at home,  for she was as one that had no life without his presence. What would  befall if he were taken from her? That thought was like the sweeping of  a dead hand across his face. So his body stooped as he walked with his  staff, and his head was held down, and his step was heavy.    Thus the old lion came on to the market-place, where the people were  gathered together as wolves to devour him. On he came, seeing nothing  and hearing nothing and fearing nothing, and in the silence of the first  surprise at sight of him his footsteps were heard on the stones.    Naomi heard them.    Then it seemed to Naomi's ears that a voice fell, as it were, out of the  air, crying, “God has given him into our hands!” After that all sounds  seemed to Naomi to fade far-away, and to come to her muffled and stifled  by the distance.    But with a loud shout, as if it had been a shout out of one great  throat, the crowd encompassed Israel crying, “Kill him!” Israel stopped,  and lifted his heavy face upon the people; but neither did he cry out  nor make any struggle for his life. He stood erect and silent in their  midst, and massive and square. His brave bearing did not break their  fury. They fell upon him, a hundred hands together. One struck at his  face, another tore at his long grey hair, and a third thrust him down on  to his knees.    No one had yet observed on the outer rim of the crowd the pale slight  girl that stood there--blind, dumb, powerless, frail, and so softly  beautiful--a waif on the margin of a tempestuous sea. Through the  thick barriers of Naomi's senses everything was coming to her ugly and  terrible. Her father was there! They were tearing him to pieces!    Suddenly she was gone from the side of the two black women. Like a flash  of light she had passed through the bellowing throng. She had thrust  herself between the people and her father, who was on the ground: she  was standing over him with both arms upraised, and at that instant God  loosed her tongue, for she was crying, “Mercy! Mercy!”    Then the crowd fell back in great fear. The dumb had spoken. No man  dared to touch Israel any more. The hands that had been lifted against  him dropped back useless, and a wide circle formed around him. In the  midst of it stood Naomi. Her blind face quivered; she seemed to glow  like a spirit. And like a spirit she had driven back the people from  their deed of blood as with the voice of God--she, the blind, the frail,  the helpless.    Israel rose to his feet, for no man touched him again, and the  procession of judges, which had now come up, was silent. And, seeing how  it was that in the hour of his great need the gift of speech had come  upon Naomi, his heart rose big within him, and he tried to triumph over  his enemies and say, “You thought God's arm was against me, but behold  how God has saved me out of your hands.”    But he could not speak. The dumbness that had fallen from his daughter  seemed to have dropped upon him.    At that moment Naomi turned to him and said, “Father!”    Then the cup of Israel's heart was full. His throat choked him. So he  took her by the hand in silence and down a long alley of the people they  passed through the Mellah gate and went home to their house. Her eyes  were to the earth, and she wept as she walked; but his face was lifted  up, and his tears and his blood ran down his cheeks together.        CHAPTER XVI    NAOMI'S BLINDNESS      Although Naomi, in her darkness and muteness since the coming of her  gift of hearing, had learned to know and understand the different  tongues of men, yet now that she tried to call forth words for herself,  and to put out her own voice in the use of them, she was no more than  a child untaught in the ways of speech. She tripped and stammered and  broke down, and had to learn to speak as any helpless little one must  do, only quicker, because her need was greater, and better, because  she was a girl and not a babe. And, perceiving her own awkwardness, and  thinking shame of it, and being abashed by the patient waiting of her  father when she halted in her talk with him, and still more humbled by  Ali's impetuous help when she miscalled her syllables, she fell back  again on silence.    Hardly could she be got to speak at all. For some days after the night  when her emancipated tongue had rescued Israel from his enemies on the  Sok, she seemed to say nothing beyond “Yes” and “No,” notwithstanding  Ali's eager questions, and Fatimah's tearful blessings, and Habeebah's  breathless invocations, and also notwithstanding the hunger and thirst  of the heart of her father, who, remembering with many throbs of joy the  voice that he heard with his dreaming ears when he slept on the straw  bed of the poor fondak at Wazzan, would have given worlds of gold, if he  had possessed them still, to hear it constantly with his waking ears.    “Come, come, little one; come, come, speak to us, only speak,” Israel  would say.    His appeals were useless. Naomi would smile and hang her sunny head, and  lift her father's hairy hand to her cheek, and say nothing.    But just about a week later a beautiful thing occurred. Israel was  returning to the Mellah after one of his secret excursions in the poor  quarter of the Bab Ramooz, where he had spent the remainder of the money  which old Reuben had paid him for the casket of his wife's jewels. The  night was warm, the moon shone with steady lustre, and the stars were  almost obliterated as separate lights by a luminous silvery haze. It was  late, very late, and far and near the town was still.    With his innocent disguise, his Moorish jellab, hung over his arm,  Israel had passed the Mellah gate, being the only Jew who was allowed  to cross it after sunset. He was feeling happy as he walked home through  the sleeping streets, with his black shadow going in front. The magic of  the summer night possessed him, and his soul was full of joy.    All his misgivings had fallen away. The coming to Naomi of the gift of  speech had seemed to banish from his mind the dark spirit of the past.  He had no heart for reprisals upon the enemies who had sought to kill  him. Without that blind effort on their part, perhaps his great blessing  had not come to pass. Man's extremity had indeed been God's opportunity  and Ruth's vision was all but realised.    Ah, Ruth! Ruth! It had escaped Israel's notice until then that he had  been thinking of his dead wife the whole night through. When he put it  to himself so, he saw the reason of it at once. It was because there  was a sort of secret charm in the certainty that where she was she  must surely know that her dream was come true. There was also a kind  of bitter pathos in the regret that she was only an angel now and not a  woman; therefore she could not be with him to share his human joy.    As he walked through the Mellah, Israel thought of her again: how she  had sung by the cradle to her babe that could not hear. Sung? Yes, he  could almost fancy that he heard her singing yet. That voice so soft,  so clear even in its whispers--there had been nothing like it in all  the world. And her songs! Israel could also fancy that he heard her  favourite one. It was a song of love, a pure but passionate melody  wherein his own delicious happiness in the earlier days, before the  death of the old Grand Rabbi, had seemed to speak and sing.    Israel began to laugh at himself as he walked. To think that the warmth  and softness of the night, the sweet caressing night, the light and  beauty of the moon and the stillness and slumber of the town, could  betray an old fellow into forgotten dreams like these!    He had taken out of his pocket the big key of the clamped door to his  house, and was crossing the shadowed lane in front of it, when suddenly  he thought he heard music coating in the air above him. He stopped and  listened. Then he had no longer any doubt. It was music, it was singing;  he knew the song, and he knew the voice. The song was the song he had  been thinking of, and the voice was the voice of Ruth.         O where is Love?       Where, where is Love?       Is it of heavenly birth?       Is it a thing of earth?       Where, where is Love?    Israel felt himself rooted to the spot, and he stood some time without  stirring. He looked around. All else was still. The night was as silent  as death. He listened attentively. The singing seemed to come from his  own house. Then he thought he must be dreaming still, and he took a step  forward. But he stopped again and covered both his ears. That was of no  avail, for when he removed his hands the voice was there as before.    A shiver ran over his limbs, yet he could not believe what his soul was  saying. The key dropped out of his hand and rang on the stone. When the  clangour was done the voice continued. Israel bethought him then that  his household must be asleep, and it flashed on his mind that if this  were a human voice the singing ought to awaken them. Just at that moment  the night guard went by and saluted him. “God bless your morning!” the  guard cried; and Israel answered, “Your morning be blessed!” That was  all. The guard seemed to have heard nothing. His footsteps were dying  away, but the voice went on.    Then a strange emotion filled Israel's heart, and he reflected that even  if it were Ruth she could have come on no evil errand. That thought gave  him courage, and he pushed forward to the door. As he fumbled the key  into the lock he saw that a beggar was crouching by the doorway in the  shadow cast by the moonlight. The man was asleep. Israel could hear his  breathing, and smell his rags. Also he could hear the thud of his own  temples like the beating of a drum in his brain.    At length, as he was groping feebly through the crooked passage, a new  thought came to him. “Naomi,” he told himself in a whisper of awe. It  was she. By the full flood of the moonlight in the patio he saw her. She  was on the balcony. Her beautiful white-robed figure was half sitting on  the rail, half leaning against the pillar. The whole lustre of the moon  was upon her. A look of joy beamed on her face. She was singing her  mother's song with her mother's voice, and all the air, and the sky, and  the quiet white town seemed to listen:--         Within my heart a voice       Bids earth and heaven rejoice       Sings--“Love, great Love       O come and claim shine own,       O come and take thy throne       Reign ever and alone,       Reign, glorious golden Love.”    Then Israel's fear was turned to rapture. Why had he not thought of this  before? Yet how could he have thought of it? He had never once heard  Naomi's voice save in the utterance of single words. But again, why had  he not remembered that before the tongues of children can speak words of  their own they sing the words of others?    The singing ended, and then Israel, struggling with his dry throat,  stepped a pace forward--his foot grated on the pavement--and he called  to the singer--    “Naomi!”    The girl bent forward, as if peering down into the darkness below, but  Israel could see that her fixed eyes were blind.    “My father!” she whispered.    “Where did you learn it?” said Israel.    “Fatimah, she taught me,” Naomi answered; and then she added quickly,  as if with great but childlike pride, saying what she did not mean, “Oh  yes, it was I! Was I not beautiful?”    After that night Naomi's shyness of speech dropped away from her, and  what was left was only a sweet maidenly unconsciousness of all faults  and failings, with a soft and playful lisp that ran in and out among the  simple words that fell from her red lips like a young squirrel among the  fallen leaves of autumn. It would be a long task to tell how her lisping  tongue turned everything then to favour and to prettiness. On the coming  of the gift of hearing, the world had first spoken to her; and now, on  the coming of the gift of speech, she herself was first speaking to the  world. What did she tell it at that first sweet greeting? She told it  what she had been thinking of it in those mute days that were gone, when  she had neither hearing nor speech, but was in the land of silence as  well as in the land of night.    The fancies of the blind maid so long shut up within the beautiful  casket of her body were strange and touching ones. Israel took delight  in them at the beginning. He loved to probe the dark places of the mind  they came from, thinking God Himself must surely have illumined it  at some time with a light that no man knew, so startling were some of  Naomi's replies, so tender and so beautiful.    One evening, not long after she had first spoken, he was sitting with  her on the roof of their house as the sun was going down over the  palpitating plains towards Arzila and Laraiche and the great sea beyond.  Twilight was gathering in the Feddan under the Mosque, and the last  light of day, which had parleyed longest with the snowy heights of the  Reef Mountains, was glowing only on the sky above them.    “Sweetheart,” said Israel, “what is the sun?”    “The sun is a fire in the sky,” Naomi answered; “my Father lights it  every morning.”    “Truly, little one, thy Father lights it,” said Israel; “thy Father  which is in heaven.”    “Sweetheart,” he said again, “what is darkness?”    “Oh, darkness is cold,” said Naomi promptly, and she seemed to shiver.    “Then the light must be warmth, little one?” said Israel.    “Yes, and noise,” she answered; and then she added quickly, “Light is  alive.”    Saying this, she crept closer to his side, and knelt there, and by her  old trick of love she took his hand in both of hers, and pressed it  against her cheek, and then, lifting her sweet face with its motionless  eyes she began to tell him in her broken words and pretty lisp what she  thought of night. In the night the world, and everything in it, was cold  and quiet. That was death. The angels of God came to the world in the  day. But God Himself came in the night, because He loved silence,  and because all the world was dead. Then He kissed things, and in the  morning all that God had kissed came to life again. If you were to get  up early you would feel God's kiss on the flowers and on the grass. And  that was why the birds were singing then. God had kissed them in the  night, and they were glad.    One day Israel took Naomi to the mearrah of the Jews, the little  cemetery outside the town walls where he had buried Ruth. And there he  told her of her mother once more; that she was in the grave, but also  with God; that she was dead, but still alive; that Naomi must not expect  to find her in that place, but, nevertheless, that she would see her yet  again.    “Do you remember her, Naomi?” he said. “Do you remember her in the old  days, the old dark and silent days? Not Fatimah, and not Habeebah, but  some one who was nearer to you than either, and loved you better than  both; some one who had soft hands, and smooth cheeks, and long, silken,  wavy hair--do you remember, little one?”    “Y-es, I think--I _think_ I remember,” said Naomi.    “That was your mother, my darling.”    “My mother?”    “Ah, you don't know what a mother is, sweetheart. How should you? And  how shall I tell you? Listen. She is the one who loves you first and  last and always. When you are a babe she suckles you and nourishes you  and fondles you, and watches for the first light of your smile, and  listens for the first accent of your tongue. When you are a young child  she plays with you, and sings to you, and tells you little stories, and  teaches you to speak. Your smile is more bright to her than sunshine,  and your childish lisp more sweet than music. If you are sick she is  beside you constantly, and when you are well she is behind you still.  Though you sin and fall and all men spurn you, yet she clings to you;  and if you do well and God prospers you, there is no joy like her joy.  Her love never changes, for it is a fount which the cold winds of the  world cannot freeze. . . . And if you are a little helpless girl--blind  and deaf and dumb maybe--then she loves you best of all. She cannot tell  you stories, and she cannot sing to you, because you cannot hear; she  cannot smile into your eyes, because you cannot see; she cannot talk to  you, because you cannot speak; but she can watch your quiet face, and  feel the touch of your little fingers and hear the sound of your merry  laughter.”    “My mother! my mother!” whispered Naomi to herself, as if in awe.    “Yes,” said Israel, “your mother was like that, Naomi, long ago, in the  days before your great gifts came to you. But she is gone, she has left  us, she could not stay; she is dead, and only from the blue mountains of  memory can she smile back upon us now.”    Naomi could not understand, but her fixed blue eyes filled with tears,  and she said abruptly, “People who die are deceitful. They want to go  out in the night to be with God. That is where they are when they go  away. They are wandering about the world when it is dead.”    The same night Naomi was missed out of the house, and for many hours no  search availed to find her. She was not in the Mellah, and therefore  she must have passed into the Moorish town before the gates closed at  sunset. Neither was she to be seen in the Feddan or at the Kasbah, or  among the Arabs who sat in the red glow of the fires that burnt before  their tents. At last Israel bethought him of the mearrah, and there  he found her. It was dark, and the lonesome place was silent. The  reflection of the lights of the town rose into the sky above it, and the  distant hum of voices came over the black town walls. And there, within  the straggling hedge of prickly pear, among the long white stones that  lay like sheep asleep among the grass, Naomi in her double darkness, the  darkness of the night and of her blindness was running to and fro, and  crying, “Mother! Mother!”    Fatimah took her the four miles to Marteel, that the breath of the sea  might bring colour to her cheeks, which had been whitened by the heat  and fumes of the town. The day was soft and beautiful, the water was  quiet, and only a gentle wind came creeping over it. But Naomi listened  to every sound with eager intentness--the light plash of the blue  wavelets that washed to her feet, the ripple of their crests when  the Levanter chased them and caught them, the dip of the oars of the  boatman, the rattle of the anchor-chains of ships in the bay, and the  fierce vociferations of the negroes who waded up to their waists to  unload the cargoes.    And when she came home, and took her old place at her father's knees,  with his hand between hers pressed close against her cheek, she told him  another sweet and startling story. There was only one thing in the world  that did not die at night, and it was water. That was because water was  the way from heaven to earth. It went up into the mountains and over  them into the air until it was lost in the clouds. And God and His  angels came and went on the water between heaven and earth. That was why  it was always moving and never sleeping, and had no night and no day.  And the angels were always singing. That was why the waters were always  making a noise, and were never silent like the grass. Sometimes their  song was joyful, and sometimes it was sad, and sometimes the evil  spirits were struggling with the angels, and that was when the waters  were terrible. Every time the sea made a little noise on the shore, an  angel had stepped on to the earth. The angel was glad.    Israel had begun to listen to Naomi's fancies with a doubting heart.  Where had they come from? Was it his duty to wipe out these beautiful  dream-stories of the maid born blind and newly come upon the joy of  hearing with his own sadder tales of what the world was and what life  was, and death and heaven? The question was soon decided for him.    Two days after Naomi had been taken to Marteel she was missed again.  Israel hurried away to the sea, and there he came upon her. Alone,  without help, she had found a boat on the beach and had pushed off on  to the water. It was a double-pronged boat, light as a nutshell, made  of ribs of rush, covered with camel-skin, and lined with bark. In this  frail craft she was afloat, and already far out in the bay not rowing,  but sitting quietly, and drifting away with the ebbing tide. The wind  was rising, and the line of the foreshore beyond the boat was white with  breakers. Israel put off after her and rescued her. The motionless eyes  began to fill when she heard his voice.    “My darling, my darling!” cried Israel; “where did you think you were  going?”    “To heaven,” she answered.    And truly she had all but gone there.    Israel had no choice left to him now. He must sadden the heart of this  creature of joy that he might keep her body safe from peril. Naomi was  no more than a little child, swayed by her impulses alone, but in more  danger from herself than any child before her, because deprived of two  of her senses until she had grown to be a maid, and no control could be  imposed upon her.    At length Israel nerved himself to his bitter task; and one evening  while Naomi sat with him on the roof while the sun was setting, and  there were noises in the streets below of the Jewish people shuffling  back into the Mellah, he told her that she was blind. The word made no  impression upon her mind at first. She had heard it before, and it had  passed her by like a sound that she did not know. She had been born  blind, and therefore could not realise what it was to see. To open a way  for the awful truth was difficult, and Israel's heart smote him while  he persisted. Naomi laughed as he put his fingers over her eyes that  he might show her. She laughed again when he asked if she could see the  people whom she could only hear. And once more she laughed when the sun  had gone down, and the mooddin had come out on the Grand Mosque in the  Metamar, and he asked if she could see the old blind man in the minaret,  where he was crying, “God is great! God is great!”    “Can you see him, little one?” said Israel.    “See him?” said Naomi; “why yes, you dear old father, of course I can  see him. Listen,” she cried, ceasing her laughter, lifting one finger,  and holding her head aslant, “listen: God is great! God is great!  There--I saw him then.”    “That is only hearing him, Naomi--hearing him with your ears--with this  ear and with this. But can you see him, sweetheart?”    Did her father mean to ask her if she could _feel_ the mooddin in his  minaret far above them? Once more she laid her head aslant. There was a  pause, and then she cried impulsively--    “Oh, _I_ know. But, you foolish old father, how _can_ I? He is too far  away.”    Then she flung her arms about Israel's neck and kissed him.    “There,” she cried, in a tone of one who settles differences, “I have  seen my _father_ anyway.”    It was hard to check her merriment, but Israel had to do it. He told  her, with many throbs in his throat, that she was not like other  maidens--not like her father, or Ali, or Fatimah, or Habeebah; that she  was a being afflicted of God; that there was something she had not got,  something she could not do, a world she did not know, and had never yet  so much as dreamt of. Darkness was more than cold and quiet, and light  was more than warmth and noise. The one was day--day ruled by the fiery  sun in the sky--and the other was night, lit by the pale moon and the  bright stars in heaven. And the face of man and the eyes of woman were  more than features to feel--they were spirit and soul, to watch and to  follow and to love without any hand being near them.    “There is a great world about you, little one,” he said, “which you have  never seen, though you can hear it and feel it and speak to it. Yes, it  is true, Naomi, it is true. You have never seen the mountains and the  dangerous gullies on their rocky sides. You have never seen the mighty  deep, and the storms that heave and swell in it. You have never seen man  or woman or child. Is that very strange, little one? Listen: your mother  died nine years ago, and you had never seen her. Your father is holding  your head in his hands at this moment, but you have never seen his face.  And if the dark curtains were to fall from your eyes, and you were to  see him now, you would not know him from another man, or from woman, or  from a tree. You are blind, Naomi, you are blind.”    Naomi listened intently. Her cheeks twitched, her fingers rested  nervously on her dress at her bosom, and her eyes grew large and solemn,  and then filled with tears. Israel's throat swelled. To tell her of all  this, though he must needs do it for her safety, was like reproaching  her with her infirmity. But it was only the trouble in her father's  voice that had found its way to the sealed chamber of Naomi's mind.  The awful and crushing truth of her blindness came later to her  consciousness, probed in and thrust home by a frailer and lighter hand.    She had always loved little children, and since the coming of her  hearing she had loved them more than ever. Their lisping tongues, their  pretty broken speech, their simple words, their childish thoughts, all  fitted with her own needs, for she was nothing but a child herself,  though grown to be a lovely maid. And of all children those she loved  best were not the children of the Jews, nor yet the children of the  Moorish townsfolk, but the ragged, barefoot, black and olive-skinned  mites who came into Tetuan with the country Arabs and Berbers on market  mornings. They were simplest, their little tongues were liveliest, and  they were most full of joy and wonder. So she would gather them up in  twos and threes and fours, on Wednesdays and Sundays, from the mouths of  their tents on the Feddan, and carry them home by the hand.    And there, in the patio, Ali had hung a swing of hempen rope, suspended  from a bar thrown from parapet to parapet, and on this Naomi would sport  with her little ones. She would be swinging in the midst of them, with  one tiny black maiden on the seat beside her, and one little black man  with high stomach and shaven poll holding on to the rope behind her, and  another mighty Moor in a diminutive white jellab pushing at their feet  in front, and all laughing together, or the children singing as the  swing rose, and she herself listening with head aslant and all her fair  hair rip-rip-rippling down her back and over her neck, and her smiling  white face resting on her shoulder.    It was a beautiful scene of sunny happiness, but out of it came the  first great shadow of the blind girl's life. For it chanced one day  that one of the children--a tiny creature with a slice of the woman in  her--brought a present for Naomi out of her mother's market-basket.  It was a flower, but of a strange kind, that grew only in the distant  mountains where lay the little black one's home. Naomi passed her  fingers over it, and she did not know it.    “What is it?” she asked.    “It's blue,” said the child.    “What is blue?” said Naomi    “Blue--don't you know?--blue!” said the child.    “But what is blue?” Naomi asked again, holding the flower in her  restless fingers.    “Why, dear me! can't you see?--blue--the flower, you know,” said the  child, in her artless way.    Ali was standing by at the time, and he thought to come to Naomi's  relief. “Blue is a colour,” he said.    “A colour?” said Naomi.    “Yes, like--like the sea,” he added.    “The sea? Blue? How?” Naomi asked.    Ali tried again. “Like the sky,” he said simply.    Naomi's face looked perplexed. “And what is the sky like?” she asked.    At that moment her beautiful face was turned towards Ali's face, and  her great motionless blue orbs seemed to gaze into his eyes. The lad was  pressed hard, and he could not keep back the answer that leapt up to his  tongue. “Like,” he said--“like--”    “Well?”    “Like your own eyes, Naomi.”    By the old habit of her nervous fingers, she covered her eyes with her  hands, as if the sense of touch would teach her what her other senses  could not tell. But the solemn mystery had dawned on her mind at last:  that she was unlike others; that she was lacking something that every  one else possessed; that the little children who played with her knew  what she could never know; that she was infirm, afflicted, cut off; that  there was a strange and lovely and lightsome world lying round about  her, where every one else might sport and find delight, but that her  spirit could not enter it, because she was shut off from it by the great  hand of God.    From that time forward everything seemed to remind her of her  affliction, and she heard its baneful voice at all times. Even her  dreams, though they had no visions, were full of voices that told of  them. If a bird sang in the air above her, she lifted her sightless  eyes. If she walked in the town on market morning and heard the din of  traffic--the cries of the dealers, the “Balak!” of the camel-men,  the “Arrah!” of the muleteers, and the twanging ginbri of the  story-tellers--she sighed and dropped her head into her breast.  Listening to the wind, she asked if it had eyes or was sightless; and  hearing of the mountains that their snowy heads rose into the clouds,  she inquired if they were blind, and if they ever talked together in the  sky.    But at the awful revelation of her blindness she ceased to be a child,  and became a woman. In the week thereafter she had learned more of the  world than in all the years of her life before. She was no longer  a restless gleam of sunlight, a reckless spirit of joy, but a weak,  patient, blind maiden, conscious of her great infirmity, humbled by it,  and thinking shame of it.    One afternoon, deserting the swing in the patio, she went out with the  children into the fields. The day was hot, and they wandered far down  the banks and dry bed of the Marteel. And as they ran and raced, the  little black people plucked the wild flowers, and called to the cattle  and the sheep and the dogs, and whistled to the linnets that whistled to  their young.    Thus the hours went on unheeded. The afternoon passed into evening, the  evening into twilight, the twilight into early night. Then the air grew  empty like a vault, and a solemn quiet fell upon the children, and they  crept to Naomi's side in fear, and took her hands and clung to her  gown. She turned back towards the town, and as they walked in the double  silence of their own hushed tongues and the songless and voiceless  world, the fingers of the little ones closed tightly upon her own.    Then the children cried in terror, “See!”    “What is it?” said Naomi.    The little ones could not tell her. It was only the noiseless summer  lightning, but the children had never seen it before. With broad white  flashes it lit up the land as far as from the bed of the river in the  valley to the white peaks of the mountains. At every flash the little  people shrieked in their fear, and there was no one there to comfort  them save Naomi only, and she was blind and could not see what they saw.  With helpless hands she held to their hands and hurried home, over the  darkening fields, through the palpitating sheets of dazzling light,  leading on, yet seeing nothing.    But Israel saw Naomi's shame. The blindness which was a sense of  humiliation to her became a sense of burning wrong to him. He had asked  God to give her speech, and had promised to be satisfied. “Give her  speech, O Lord,” he had cried, “speech that shall lift her above the  creatures of the field, speech whereby alone she may ask and know.” But  what was speech without sight to her who had always been blind? What was  all the world to one who had never seen it? Only as Paradise is to Man,  who can but idly dream of its glories.    Israel took back his prayer. There were things to know that words could  never tell. Now was Naomi blind for the first time, being no longer  dumb. “Give her sight, O Lord,” he cried; “open her eyes that she may  see; let her look on Thy beautiful world and know it! Then shall her  life be safe, and her heart be happy, and her soul be Thine, and Thy  servant at last be satisfied!”        CHAPTER XVII    ISRAEL'S GREAT RESOLVE      It was six-and-twenty days since the night of the meeting on the Sok,  and no rain had yet fallen. The eggs of the locust might be hatched  at any time. Then the wingless creatures would rise on the face of the  earth like snow, and the poor lean stalks of wheat and barley that were  coming green out of the ground would wither before them. The country  people were in despair. They were all but stripped of their cattle; they  had no milk; and they came afoot to the market. Death seemed to look  them in the face. Neither in the mosques nor in the synagogues did they  offer petitions to God for rain. They had long ceased their prayers.  Only in the Feddan at the mouths of their tents did they lift up their  heavy eyes to the hot haze of the pitiless sky and mutter, “It is  written!”    Israel was busy with other matters. During these six-and-twenty days he  had been asking himself what it was right and needful that he should do.  He had concluded at length that it was his duty to give up the office he  held under the Kaid. No longer could he serve two masters. Too long had  he held to the one, thinking that by recompense and restitution, by fair  dealing and even-handed justice, he might atone to the other. Recompense  was a mockery of the sufferings which had led to death; restitution was  no longer possible--his own purse being empty--without robbery of the  treasury of his master; fair dealing and even justice were a vain hope  in Barbary, where every man who held office, from the heartless Sultan  in his hareem to the pert Mut'hasseb in the market, must be only as a  human torture-jellab, made and designed to squeeze the life-blood out of  the man beneath him.    To endure any longer the taunts and laughter of Ben Aboo was impossible,  and to resist the covetous importunities of his Spanish woman, Katrina,  was a waste of shame and spirit. Besides, and above all, Israel  remembered that God had given him grace in the sacrifices which he had  made already. Twice had God rewarded him, in the mercy He had shown to  Naomi, for putting by the pomp and circumstance of the world. Would  His great hand be idle now--now when he most needed its mighty and  miraculous power when Naomi, being conscious of her blindness, was  mourning and crying for sweet sight of the world and he himself was  about to put under his feet the last of his possessions that separated  him from other men--his office that he wrought for in the early days  with sweat of brow and blood, and held on to in the later days through  evil report and hatred, that he might conquer the fate that had first  beaten him down!    Israel was in the way of bribing God again, forgetting, in the heat  of his desire, the shame of his journey to Shawan. He made his  preparations, and they were few. His money was gone already, and so were  his dead wife's jewels. He had determined that he would keep his house,  if only as a shelter to Naomi (for he owed something to her material  comfort as well as her spiritual welfare), but that its furniture and  belongings were more luxurious than their necessity would require or  altered state allow.    So he sold to a Jewish merchant in the Mellah the couches and great  chairs which he had bought out of England, as well as the carpets  from Rabat, the silken hangings from Fez, and the purple canopies from  Morocco city. When these were gone, and nothing remained but the simple  rugs and mattresses which are all that the house of a poor man needs in  that land where the skies are kind, he called his servants to him as he  sat in the patio--Ali as well as the two bondwomen--for he had decided  that he must part with them also, and they must go their ways.    “My good people,” he said, “you have been true and faithful servants to  me this many a year--you, Fatimah, and you also, Habeebah, since before  the days when my wife came to me--and you too, Ali, my lad, since you  grew to be big and helpful. Little I thought to part with you until my  good time should come; but my life in our poor Barbary is over already,  and to-morrow I shall be less than the least of all men in Tetuan. So  this is what I have concluded to do. You, Fatimah, and you, Habeebah,  being given to me as bondwomen by the Kaid in the old days when  my power, which now is little and of no moment, was great and  necessary--you belong to me. Well, I give you your liberty. Your papers  are in the name of Ben Aboo, and I have sealed them with his seal--that  is the last use but one that I shall put it to. Here they are, both of  them. Take them to the Kadi after prayers in the morning, and he will  ratify your title. Then you will be free women for ever after.”    The black women had more than once broken in upon Israel's words with  exclamations of surprise and consternation. “Allah!” “Bismillah!” “Holy  Saints!” “By the beard of the Prophet!” And when at length he put the  deeds of emancipation into their hands they fell into loud fits of  hysterical weeping.    “As for you, Ali, my son,” Israel continued, “I cannot give you your  freedom, for you are a freeman born. You have been a son to me these  fourteen years. I have another task for you--a perilous task, a solemn  duty--and when it is done I shall see you no more. My brave boy, you  will go far, but I do not fear for you. When you are gone I shall think  of you; and if you should sometimes think of your old master who could  not keep you, we may not always be apart.”    The lad had listened to these words in blank bewilderment. That strange  disasters had of late befallen their household was an idea that had  forced itself upon his unwilling mind. But that Israel, the greatest,  noblest, mightiest man in the world--let the dogs of rasping Jews and  the scurvy hounds of Moors yelp and bark as they would--should fall to  be less than the least in Tetuan, and, having fallen that he should  send him away--him, Ali, his boy whom he had brought up, Naomi's old  playfellow--Allah! Allah! in the name of the merciful God, what did his  master mean?    Ali's big eyes began to fill, and great beads rolled down his black  cheeks. Then, recovering his speech he blurted out that he would not go.  He would follow his father and serve him until the end of his life. What  did he want with wages? Who asked for any? No going his ways for him! A  pretty thing, wasn't it, that he should go off, and never see his father  again, no, nor Naomi--Naomi--that-that--but God would show! God would  show!    And, following Ali's lead, Fatimah stepped up to Israel and offered her  paper back. “Take it,” she said; “I don't want any liberty. I've got  liberty enough as I am. And here--here,” fumbling in her waistband and  bringing out a knitted purse; “I would have offered it before, only I  thought shame. My wages? Yes. You've paid us wages these nine years,  haven't you; and what right had we to any, being slaves? You will not  take it, my lord? Well, then, my dear master, if I must go, if I must  leave you, take my papers and sell me to some one. I shall not care,  and you have a right to do it. Perhaps I'll get another good master--who  knows?”    Her brows had been knitted, and she had tried to look stern and angry,  but suddenly her cheeks were a flood of tears.    “I'm a fool!” she cried. “I'll never get a good master again; but if I  get a bad one, and he beats me, I'll not mind, for I'll think of  you, and my precious jewel of gold and silver, my pretty gazelle,  Naomi--Allah preserve her!--that you took my money, and I'm bearing it  for both of you, as we might say--working for you--night and day--night  and day--”    Israel could endure no more. He rose up and fled out of the patio  into his own room, to bury his swimming face. But his soul was big  and triumphant. Let the world call him by what names it would--tyrant,  traitor, outcast pariah--there were simple hearts that loved and  honoured him--ay, honoured him--and they were the hearts that knew him  best.    The perilous task reserved for Ali was to go to Shawan and to liberate  the followers of Absalam, who, less happy than their leader, whose  strong soul was at rest, were still in prison without abatement of  the miseries they lay under. He was to do this by power of a warrant  addressed to the Kaid of Shawan and drawn under the seal of the Kaid of  Tetuan. Israel had drawn it, and sealed it also, without the knowledge  or sanction of Ben Aboo; for, knowing what manner of man Ben Aboo was,  and knowing Katrina also, and the sway she held over him, and thinking  it useless to attempt to move either to mercy, he had determined to make  this last use of his office, at all risks and hazards.    Ben Aboo might never hear that the people were at large, for Ali was to  forbid them to return to Tetuan, and Shawan was sixty weary miles away.  And if he ever did hear, Israel himself would be there to bear the brunt  of his displeasure, but Ali the instrument of his design, must be  far away. For when the gates of the prison had been opened, and the  prisoners had gone free, Ali was neither to come back to Tetuan nor to  remain in Morocco, but with the money that Israel gave him out of the  last wreck of his fortune he was to make haste to Gibraltar by way  of Ceuta, and not to consider his life safe until he had set foot in  England.    “England!” cried Ali. “But they are all white men there.”    “White-hearted men, my lad,” said Israel; “and a Jewish man may find  rest for the sole of his foot among them.”    That same day the black boy bade farewell to Israel and to Naomi. He was  leaving them for ever, and he was broken-hearted. Israel was his father,  Naomi was his sister, and never again should he set his eyes on either.  But in the pride of his perilous mission he bore himself bravely.    “Well, good-night,” he said, taking Naomi's hand, but not looking into  her blind face.    “Good-night,” she answered, and then, after a moment, she flung her arms  about his neck and kissed him. He laughed lightly, and turned to Israel.    “Good-night, father,” he said in a shrill voice.    “A safe journey to you, my son,” said Israel; “and may you do all my  errands.”    “God burn my great-grandfather if I do not!” said Ali stoutly.    But with that word of his country his brave bearing at length broke  down, and drawing Israel aside, that Naomi might not hear, he whispered,  sobbing and stammering, “When--when I am gone, don't, don't tell her  that I was black.”    Then in an instant he fled away.    “In peace!” cried Israel after him. “In peace! my brave boy, simple,  noble, loyal heart!”    Next morning Israel, leaving Naomi at home, set off for the Kasbah, that  he might carry out his great resolve to give up the office he held under  the Kaid. And as he passed through the streets his head was held up, and  he walked proudly. A great burden had fallen from him, and his spirit  was light. The people bent their heads before him as he passed, and  scowled at him when he was gone by. The beggars lying at the gate of the  Mosque spat over their fingers behind his back, and muttered “Bismillah!  In the name of God!” A negro farmer in the Feddan, who was bent double  over a hoof as he was shoeing a bony and scabby mule, lifted his ugly  face, bathed in sweat, and grinned at Israel as he went along. A  group of Reefians, dirty and lean and hollow-eyed, feeding their  gaunt donkeys, and glancing anxiously at the sky over the heads of the  mountains, snarled like dogs as he strode through their midst. The sky  was overcast, and the heads of the mountains were capped with mist.  “Balak!” sounded in Israel's ears from every side. “Arrah!” came  constantly at his heels. A sweet-seller with his wooden tray swung in  front of him, crying, “Sweets, all sweets, O my lord Edrees, sweets,  all sweets,” changed the name of the patron saint of candies, and cried,  “Sweets, all sweets, O my lord Israel, sweets, all sweets!” The girl  selling clay peered up impudently into Israel's eyes, and the oven-boy,  answering the loud knocking of the bodiless female arms thrust out at  doors standing ajar, made his wordless call articulate with a mocking  echo of Israel's name.    What matter? Israel could not be wroth with the poor people.  Six-and-twenty years he had gone in and out among them as a slave. This  morning he was a free man, and to-morrow he would be one of themselves.    When he reached the Kasbah, there was something in the air about it that  brought back recollections of the day--now nearly four years past--of  the children's gathering at Katrina's festival. The lusty-lunged Arabs  squatting at the gates among soldiers in white selhams and peaked  shasheeahs the women in blankets standing in the outer court, the dark  passages smelling of damp, the gusts of heavy odour coming from the  inner chambers, and the great patio with the fountain and fig-trees--the  same voluptuous air was over everything. And as on that day so on this,  in the alcove under the horseshoe arch sat Ben Aboo and his Spanish  wife.    Time had dealt with them after their kind, and the swarthy face of the  Kaid was grosser, the short curls under his turban were more grey and  his hazel eyes were now streaked and bleared, but otherwise he was the  same man as before, and Katrina also, save for the loss of some teeth  of the upper row, was the same woman. And if the children had risen up  before Israel's eyes as he stood on the threshold of the patio, he could  not have drawn his breath with more surprise than at the sight of the  man who stood that morning in their place.    It was Mohammed of Mequinez. He had come to ask for the release of  the followers of Absalam from their prison at Shawan. In defiance  of courtesy his slippers were on his feet. He was clad in a piece of  untanned camel-skin, which reached to his knees and was belted about his  waist. His head, which was bare to the sun and drooped by nature like a  flower, was held proudly up, and his wild eyes were flashing. He was not  supplicating for the deliverance of the people, but demanding it, and  taxing Ben Aboo as a tyrant to his throat.    “Give me them up, Ben Aboo,” he was saying as Israel came to the  threshold, “or, if they die in their prison, one thing I promise you.”    “And pray what is that?” said Ben Aboo.    “That there will be a bloody inquiry after their murderer.”    Ben Aboo's brows were knitted, but he only glanced at Katrina, and made  pretence to laugh, and then said, “And pray, my lord, who shall the  murderer be?”    Then Mohammed of Mequinez stretched out his hand and answered,  “Yourself.”    At that word there-was silence for a moment, while Ben Aboo shifted in  his seat, and Katrina quivered beside him.    Ben Aboo glanced up at Mohammed. He was Kaid, he was Basha, he was  master of all men within a circuit of thirty miles, but he was afraid of  this man whom the people called a prophet. And partly out of this fear,  and partly because he had more regard to Mohammed's courageous behaviour  in thus bearding him in his Kasbah and by the walls of his dungeons than  to the anger his hot word had caused him, Ben Aboo would have promised  him at that moment that the prisoners at Shawan should be released.    But suddenly Katrina remembered that she also had cause of indignation  against this man, for it had been rumoured of late that Mohammed had  openly denounced her marriage.    “Wait, Sidi,” she said. “Is not this the fellow that has gone up and  down your bashalic, crying out on our marriage that it was against the  law of Mohammed?”    At that Ben Aboo saw clearly that there was no escape for him, so he  made pretence to laugh again, and said, “Allah! so it is! Mohammed the  Third, eh? Son of Mequinez, God will repay you! Thanks! Thanks! You  could never think how long I've waited that I might look face to face  upon the prophet that has denounced a Kaid.”    He uttered these big words between bursts of derisive laughter, but  Mohammed struck the laughter from his lips in an instant. “Wait no  longer, O Ben Aboo,” he cried, “but look upon him now, and know that  what you have done is an unclean thing, and you shall be childless and  die!”    Then Ben Aboo's passion mastered him. He rose to his feet in his anger,  and cried, “Prophet, you have destroyed yourself. Listen to me! The  turbulent dogs you plead for shall lie in their prison until they perish  of hunger and rot of their sores. By the beard of my father, I swear  it!”    Mohammed did not flinch. Throwing back his head, he answered, “If I am  a prophet, O Ben Aboo hear me prophesy. Before that which you say shall  come to pass, both you and your father's house will be destroyed. Never  yet did a tyrant go happily out of the world, and you shall go out of it  like a dog.”    Then Katrina also rose to her feet, and, calling to a group of  barefooted Arab soldiers that stood near, she cried, “Take him! He will  escape!”    But the soldiers did not move, and Ben Aboo fell back on his seat, and  Mohammed, fearing nothing, spoke again.    “In a vision of last night I saw you, O Ben Aboo and for the contempt  you had cast upon our holy laws, and for the destruction you had wrought  on our poor people, the sword of vengeance had fallen upon you. And  within this very court, and on that very spot where your feet now rest,  your whole body did lie; and that woman beside you lay over you wailing  and your blood was on her face and on her hands, and only she was with  you, for all else had forsaken you--all save one, and that was your  enemy, and he had come to see you with his eyes, and to rejoice over you  with his heart, because you were fallen and dead.”    Then, in the creeping of his terror, Ben Aboo rose up again and reeled  backward and his eyes were fixed steadfastly downward at his feet where  the eyes of Mohammed had rested. It was almost as if he saw the awful  thing of which Mohammed had spoken, so strong was the power of the  vision upon him.    But recovering himself quickly, he cried, “Away! In the name of God,  away!”    “I will go,” said Mohammed; “and beware what you do while I am gone.”    “Do you threaten me?” cried Ben Aboo. “Will you go to the Sultan? Will  you appeal to Abd er-Rahman?”    “No, Ben Aboo; but to God.”    So saying, Mohammed of Mequinez strode out of the place, for no man  hindered him. Then Ben Aboo sank back on to his seat as one that was  speechless, and nothing had the crimson on his body availed him, or the  silver on his breast, against that simple man in camel-skin, who owned  nothing and asked nothing, and feared neither Kaid nor King.    When Ben Aboo had regained himself, he saw Israel standing at the  doorway, and he beckoned to him with the downward motion, which is the  Moorish manner. And rising on his quaking limbs he took him aside and  said, “I know this fellow. Ya Allah! Allah! For all his vaunts and  visions he has gone to Abd er-Rahman. God will show! God will show! I  dare not take him! Abd er-Rahman uses him to spy and pry on his Bashas!  Camel-skin coat? Allah! a fine disguise! Bismillah! Bismillah!”    Then, looking back at the place where Mohammed in the vision saw his  body lie outstretched, he dropped his voice to a whisper, and said,  “Listen! You have my seal?”    Israel without a word, put his hand into the pocket of his waistband,  and drew out the seal of Ben Aboo.    “Right! Now hear me, in the name of the merciful God. Do not liberate  these infidel dogs at Shawan and do not give them so much as bread to  eat or water to drink, but let such as own them feed them. And if ever  the thing of which that fellow has spoken should come to pass--do you  hear?--in the hour wherein it befalls--Allah preserve me!--in that hour  draw a warrant on the Kaid of Shawan and seal it with my seal--are you  listening?--a warrant to put every man, woman, and child to the sword.  Ya Allah! Allah! We will deal with these spies of Abd er-Rahman!  So shall there be mourning at my burial--Holy Saints! Holy  Saints!--mourning, I say, among them that look for joy at my death.”    Thus in a quaking voice, sometimes whispering, and again breaking into  loud exclamations, Ben Aboo in his terror poured his broken words into  Israel's ear.    Israel made no answer. His eyes had become dim--he scarcely saw the  walls of the place wherein they stood. His ears had become dense--he  scarcely heard the voice of Ben Aboo, though the Kaid's hot breath was  beating upon his cheek. But through the haze he saw the shadow of one  figure tramping furiously to and fro, and through the thick air the  voice of another figure came muffled and harsh. For Katrina, having  chased away with smiles the evil looks of Ben Aboo, had turned to Israel  and was saying--    “What is this I hear of your beautiful daughter--this Naomi of  yours--that she has recovered her speech and hearing! When did that  happen, pray? No answer? Ah, I see, you are tired of the deception. You  kept it up well between you. But is she still blind? So? Dear me! Blind,  poor child. Think of it!”    Israel neither answered nor looked up, but stood motionless on the  same place, holding the seal in his hand. And Ben Aboo, in his restless  tramping up and down, came to him again, and said, “Why are you a Jew,  Israel ben Oliel? The dogs of your people hate you. Witness to the  Prophet! Resign yourself! Turn Muslim, man--what's to hinder you?”    Still Israel made no reply. But Ben Aboo continued: “Listen! The people  about me are in the pay of the Sultan, and after all you are the best  servant I have ever had. Say the Kelmah, and I'll make you my Khaleefa.  Do you hear?--my Khaleefa, with power equal to my own. Man, why don't  you speak? Are you grown stupid of late as well as weak and womanish?”        CHAPTER XVIII    THE LIGHT-BORN MESSENGER      “Basha,” said Israel--he spoke slowly and quietly; but with forced  calmness--“Basha, you must seek another hand for work like that--this  hand of mine shall never seal that warrant.”    “Tut, man!” whispered Ben Aboo. “Do your new measles break out  everywhere? Am I not Kaid? Can I not make you my Khaleefa?”    Israel's face was worn and pale, but his eye burned with the fire of his  great resolve.    “Basha,” he said again calmly and quietly, “if you were Sultan and could  make me your Vizier, I would not do it.”    “Why?” cried Ben Aboo; “why? why?”    “Because,” said Israel, “I am here to deliver up your seal to you.”    “You? Grace of God!” cried Ben Aboo.    “I am here,” continued Israel, as calmly as before, “to resign my  office.”    “Resign your office? Deliver up your seal?” cried Ben Aboo. “Man, man,  are you mad?”    “No, Basha, not to-day,” said Israel quietly. “I must have been that  when I came here first, five-and-twenty years ago.”    Ben Aboo gnawed his lip and scowled darkly, and in the flush of his  anger, his consternation being over, he would have fallen upon Israel  with torrents of abuse, but that he was smitten suddenly by a new and  terrible thought. Quivering and trembling, and muttering short prayers  under his breath, he recoiled from the place where Israel stood, and  said, “There is something under all this? What is it? Let me think! Let  me think!”    Meantime the face of Katrina beneath its covering of paint had grown  white, and in scarcely smothered tones of wrath, by the swift instinct  of a suspicious nature, she was asking herself the same question, “What  does it mean? What does it mean?”    In another moment Ben Aboo had read the riddle his own way. “Wait!” he  cried, looking vainly for help and answer into the faces of his people  about him. “Who said that when he was away from Tetuan he went to Fez?  The Sultan was there then. He had just come up from Soos. That's it! I  knew it! The man is like all the rest of them. Abd er-Rahman has bought  him. Allah! Allah! What have I done that every soul that eats my bread  should spy and pry on me?”    Satisfied with this explanation of Israel's conduct, Ben Aboo waited for  no further assurance, but fell to a wild outburst of mingled prayers and  protests. “O Giver of Good to all! O Creator! It is Abd er-Rahman again.  Ya Allah! Ya Allah! Or else his rapacious satellites--his thieves,  his robbers, his cut-throats! That bloated Vizier! That leprous Naib  es-Sultan! Oh, I know them. Bismillah! They want to fleece me. They want  to squeeze me of my little wealth--my just savings--my hard earnings  after my long service. Curse them! Curse their relations! O Merciful! O  Compassionate! They'll call it arrears of taxes. But no, by the beard of  my father, no! Not one feels shall they have if I die for it. I'm an old  soldier--they shall torture me. Yes, the bastinado, the jellab--but I'll  stand firm! Allah! Allah! Bismillah! Why does Abd er-Rahman hate me?  It's because I'm his brother--that's it, that's it! But I've never risen  against him. Never, never! I've paid him all! All! I tell you I've paid  everything. I've got nothing left. You know it yourself, Israel, you  know it.”    Thus, in the crawling of his fear he cried with maudlin tears, pleaded  and entreated and threatened fumbling meantime the beads of his rosary  and tramping nervously to and fro about the patio until he drew up  at length, with a supplicating look, face to face with Israel. And if  anything had been needed to fix Israel to his purpose of withdrawing for  ever from the service of Ben Aboo, he must have found it in this pitiful  spectacle of the Kaid's abject terror, his quick suspicion, his base  disloyalty, and rancorous hatred of his own master, the Sultan.    But, struggling to suppress his contempt, Israel said, speaking as  slowly and calmly as at first, “Basha, have no fear; I have not sold  myself to Abd er-Rahman. It is true that I was at Fez--but not to see  the Sultan. I have never seen him. I am not his spy. He knows nothing  of me. I know nothing of him, and what I am doing now is being done for  myself alone.”    Hearing this, and believing it, for, liars and prevaricators as were the  other men about him, Israel had never yet deceived him, Ben Aboo made  what poor shift he could to cover his shame at the sorry weakness he  had just betrayed. And first he gazed in a sort of stupor into Israel's  steadfast face; and then he dropped his evil eyes, and laughed in scorn  of his own words, as if trying to carry them off by a silly show of  braggadocio, and to make believe that they had been no more than a  humorous pretence, and that no man would be so simple as to think he had  truly meant them. But, after this mockery, he turned to Israel again,  and, being relieved of his fears, he fell back to his savage mood once  more, without disguise and without shame.    “And pray, sir,” said he, with a ghastly smile, “what riches have you  gathered that you are at last content to hoard no more?”    “None,” said Israel shortly.    Ben Aboo laughed lustily, and exchanged looks of obvious meaning with  Katrina.    “And pray, again,” he said, with a curl of the lip, “without office and  without riches how may you hope to live?”    “As a poor man among poor men,” said Israel, “serving God and trusting  to His mercy.”    Again Ben Aboo laughed hoarsely, and Katrina joined him, but Israel  stood quiet and silent, and gave no sign.    “Serving God is hard bread,” said Ben Aboo.    “Serving the devil is crust!” said Israel.    At that answer, though neither by look nor gesture had Israel pointed  it, the face of Ben Aboo became suddenly discoloured and stern.    “Allah! What do you mean?” he cried. “Who are you that you dare wag your  insolent tongue at me?”    “I am your scapegoat, Basha,” said Israel, with an awful calm--“your  scapegoat, who bears your iniquities before the eyes of your people.  Your scapegoat, who sins against them and oppresses them and brings them  by bitter tortures to the dust and death. That's what I am, Basha, and  have long been, shame upon me! And while I am down yonder in the streets  among your people--hated, reviled, despised, spat upon, cut off--you are  up here in the Kasbah above them, in honour and comfort and wealth, and  the mistaken love of all men.”    While Israel said this, Ben Aboo in his fury came down upon him from the  opposite side of the patio with a look of a beast of prey. His swarthy  cheeks were drawn hard, his little bleared eyes flashed, his heavy nose  and thick lips and massive jaw quivered visibly, and from under his  turban two locks of iron-grey fell like a shaggy mane over his ears.    But Israel did not flinch. With a look of quiet majesty, standing face  to face with the tyrant, not a foot's length between them, he spoke  again and said, “Basha, I do not envy you, but neither will I share your  business nor your rewards. I mean to be your scapegoat no more. Here is  your seal. It is red with the blood of your unhappy people through these  five-and-twenty bad years past. I can carry it no longer. Take it.”    In a tempest of wrath Ben Aboo struck the seal out of Israel's hand as  he offered it, and the silver rolled and rang on the tiled pavement of  the patio.    “Fool!” he cried. “So this is what it is! Allah! In the name of the most  merciful God, who would have believed it? Israel ben Oliel a prophet! A  prophet of the poor! O Merciful! O Compassionate!”    Thus, in his frenzy, pretending to imitate with airs of manifest mockery  his outbreak of fear a few minutes before, Ben Aboo raved and raged and  lifted his clenched fist to the sky in sham imprecation of God.    “Who said it was the Sultan?” he cried again. “He was a fool. Abd  er-Rahman? No; but Mohammed of Mequinez! Mohammed the Third! That's it!  That's it!”    So saying, and forgetting in his fury what he had said before of  Mohammed himself, he laughed wildly, and beat about the patio from side  to side like a caged and angry beast.    “And if I am a tyrant,” he said in a thick voice, “who made me so? If  I oppress the poor, who taught me the way to do it? Whose clever brain  devised new means of revenue? Ransoms, promissory notes, bonds, false  judgments--what did I know of such things? Who changed the silver  dollars at nine ducats apiece? And who bought up the debts of the people  that murmured against such robbery? Allah! Allah! Whose crafty head  did all this? Why, yours--yours--Israel ben Oliel! By the beard of the  Prophet, I swear it!”    Israel stood unmoved, and when these reproaches were hurled at him, he  answered calmly and sadly, “God's ways are not our ways, neither are  His thoughts our thoughts. He works His own will, and we are but His  ministers. I thought God's justice had failed, but it has overtaken  myself. For what I did long ago of my own free will and intention to  oppress the poor, I have suffered and still am suffering.”    All this time the Spanish wife of Ben Aboo had sat in the alcove with  lips whitening under their crimson patches of paint, beating her fan  restlessly on the empty air, and breathing rapid and audible breath. And  now, at this last word of Israel, though so sadly spoken, and so solemn  in its note of suffering, she broke into a trill of laughter, and said  lightly, “Ah! I thought your love of the poor was young. Not yet cut its  teeth, poor thing! A babe in swaddling clothes, eh? When was it born?”    “About the time that you were, madam,” said Israel, lifting his heavy  eyes upon her.    At that her lighter mood gave place to quick anger. “Husband,” she  cried, turning upon Ben Aboo with the bitterness of reproach, “I hope  you now see that I was right about this insolent old man. I told you  from the first what would come of him. But no, you would have your own  foolish way. It was easy to see that the devil's dues were in him. Yet  you would not believe me! You would believe him. Simpleton as you are,  you are believing him now! The poor? Fiddle-faddle and fiddlesticks! I  tell you again this man is trying to put his foot on your neck. How? Oh,  trust him, he's got his own schemes! Look to it, El Arby, look to it!  He'll be master in Tetuan yet!”    Saying this, she had wrought herself up to a pitch of wrath, sometimes  laughing wildly, and then speaking in a voice that was like an angry  cry. And now, rising to her feet and facing towards the Arab soldiers,  who stood aside in silence and wonder, she cried, “Arabs, Berbers,  Moors, Christians, fight as you will, follow the Basha as you may,  you'll lie in the same bed yet! But where? Under the heels of the Jew!”    A hoarse murmur ran from lip to lip among the men, and the ghostly smile  came back into the face of Ben Aboo.    “You must be right,” he said, “you must be right! Ya Allah! Ya Allah!  This is the dog that I picked out of the mire. I found him a beggar, and  I gave him wealth. An impostor, a personator, a cheat, and I gave him  place and rank. When he had no home, I housed him, and when he could  find no one to serve him, I gave him slaves. I have banished his  enemies, and imprisoned those he hated. After his wife had died, and  none came near him, and he was left to howk out her grave with his own  hands, I gave him prisoners to bury her, and when he was done with them  I set them free. All these years I have heaped fortune upon him. Ya  Allah! His master! No, but his servant, doing his will at the lifting of  his finger. And all for what? For this! For this! For this! Ingrate!” he  cried in his thick voice, turning hotly upon Israel again, “if you must  give up your seal, why should you do it like a fool? Could you not come  to me and say, 'Kaid, I am old and weary; I am rich, and have enough; I  have served you long and faithfully; let me rest'--why not? I say, why  not?”    Israel answered calmly, “Because it would have been a lie, Basha.”    “So it would,” cried Ben Aboo sharply, “so it would: you are right--it  would have been a lie, an accursed lie! But why must you come to me and  say, 'Basha, you are a tyrant, and have made me a tyrant also; you have  sucked the blood of your people, and made me to drink it.”    “Because it is true, Basha,” said Israel.    At that Ben-Aboo stopped suddenly, and his swarthy face grew hideous and  awful. Then, pointing with one shaking hand at the farther end of the  patio, he said, “There is another thing that is true. It is true that on  the other side of that wall there is a prison,” and, lifting his voice  to a shriek, he added, “you are on the edge of a gulf, Israel ben Oliel.  One step more--”    But just at that moment Israel turned full upon him, face to face, and  the threat that he was about to utter seemed to die in his stifling  throat. If only he could have provoked Israel to anger he might have  had his will of him. But that slow, impassive manner, and that worn  countenance so noble in sadness and suffering, was like a rebuke of his  passion, and a retort upon his words.    And truly it seemed to Israel that against the Basha's story of his  ingratitude he could tell a different tale. This pitiful slave of  rage and fear, this thing of rags and patches, this whining, maudlin,  shrieking, bleating, barking-creature that hurled reproaches at him, was  the master in whose service he had spent his best brain and best blood.  But for the strong hand that he had lent him, but for the cool head  wherewith he had guarded him, where would the man be now? In the  dungeons of Abd er-Rahman, having gone thither by way of the Sultan's  wooden jellabs and his houses of fierce torture. By the mind's eye  Israel could see him there at that instant--sightless, eyeless, hungry,  gaunt. But no, he was still here--fat, sleek, voluptuous, imperious. And  good men lay perishing in his prisons, and children, starved to death,  lay in their graves, and he himself, his servant and scapegoat, whose  brains he had drained, whose blood he had sweated, stood before him  there like an old lion, who had been wandering far and was beaten back  by his cubs.    But what matter? He could silence the Basha with a word; yet why should  he speak it? Twenty times he had saved this man, who could neither  read nor write nor reckon figures, from the threatened penalties of the  Shereefean Court, and he could count them all up to him; yet why should  he do so? Through five-and-twenty evil years he had built up this man's  house; yet why should he boast of what was done, being done so foully?  He had said his say, and it was enough. This hour of insult and outrage  had been written on his forehead, and he must have come to it. Then  courage! courage!    “Husband,” cried the woman, showing her toothless jaw in a bitter smile  to Ben Aboo as he crossed the patio, “you must scour this vermin out of  Tetuan!”    “You are right,” he answered. “By Allah, you are right! And henceforth I  will be served by soldiers, not by scribblers.”    Then, wheeling about once more to where Israel stood, he said in a voice  of mockery, “Master, my lord, my Sultan, you came to resign your office?  But you shall do more than that. You shall resign your house as well,  and all that's in it, and leave this town as a beggar.”    Israel stood unmoved. “As you will,” he said quietly.    “Where are the two women--the slaves?” asked Ben Aboo.    “At home,” said Israel.    “They are mine, and I take them back,” said Ben Aboo.    Israel's face quivered, and he seemed to be about to protest, but he  only drew a longer breath, and said again, “As you will, Basha.”    Ben Aboo's voice gathered vehemence at every fresh question. “Where  is your money?” he cried; “the money that you have made out of my  service--out of me--_my_ money--where is it?”    “Nowhere,” said Israel.    “It's a lie--another lie!” cried Ben Aboo. “Oh yes, I've heard of your  charities, master. They were meant to buy over my people, were they?  Were they? Were they, I ask?”    “So you say, Basha,” said Israel.    “So I know!” cried Ben Aboo; “but all you had is not gone that way.  You're a fool, but not fool enough for that! Give up your keys--the keys  of your house!”    Israel hesitated, and then said, “Let me return for a minute--it is all  I ask.”    At that the woman laughed hysterically. “Ah! he has something left after  all!” she cried.    Israel turned his slow eyes upon her, and said, “Yes, madam, I _have_  something left--after all.”    Paying no heed to the reply, Katrina cried to Ben Aboo again, saying,  “El Arby, make him give up the key of that house. He has treasure  there!”    “It is true, madam,” said Israel; “it is true that I have a treasure  there. My daughter--my little blind Naomi.”    “Is that all?” cried Katrina and Ben Aboo together.    “It is all,” said Israel, “but it is enough. Let me fetch her.”    “Don't allow it!” cried Katrina.    Israel's face betrayed feeling. He was struggling to suppress it. “Make  me homeless if you will,” he said, “turn me like a beggar out of your  town, but let me fetch my daughter.”    “She'll not thank you,” cried Katrina.    “She loves me,” said Israel, “I am growing old, I am numbering the steps  of death. I need her joyous young life beside me in my declining age.  Then, she is helpless, she is blind, she is my scapegoat, Basha, as I am  yours, and no one save her father--”    “Ah! Ah! Ah!”    Israel had spoken warmly, and at the tender fibres of feeling that had  been forced out of him at last the woman was laughing derisively. “Trust  me,” she cried, “I know what daughters are. Girls like better things.  No, I'll give her what will be more to her taste. She shall stay here  with me.”    Israel drew himself up to his full height and answered, “Madam, I would  rather see her dead at my feet.”    Then Ben Aboo broke in and said, “Don't wag your tongue at your  mistress, sir.”    “_Your_ mistress, Basha,” said Israel; “not mine.”    At that word Katrina, with all her evil face aflame came sweeping down  upon Israel, and struck him with her fan on the forehead. He did not  flinch or speak. The blow had burst the skin, and a drop of blood  trickled over the temple on to the cheek. There was a short deep pause.    Then the hard tension of silence was broken by a faint cry. It came from  behind, from the doorway; it was the voice of a girl.    In the blank stupor of the moment, every eye being on the two that stood  in the midst, no one had observed until then that another had entered  the patio. It was Naomi. How long she had been there no one knew, and  how she had come unnoticed through the corridors out of the streets  scarce any one--even when time sufficed to arrange the scattered  thoughts of the Makhazni, the guard at the gate--could clearly tell. She  stood under the arch, with one hand at her breast, which heaved visibly  with emotion, and the other hand stretched out to touch the open  iron-clamped door, as if for help and guidance. Her head was held up,  her lips were apart, and her motionless blind eyes seemed to stare  wildly. She had heard the hot words. She had heard the sound of the blow  that followed them. Her father was smitten! Her father! Her father!  It was then that she uttered the cry. All eyes turned to her. Quaking,  reeling, almost falling, she came tottering down the patio. Soul and  sense seemed to be struggling together in her blind face. What did it  all mean? What was happening? Her fixed eyes stared as if they must  burst the bonds that bound them, and look and see, and know!    At that moment God wrought a mighty work, a wondrous change, such as He  has brought to pass but twice or thrice since men were born blind into  His world of light. In an instant, at a thought, by one spontaneous  flash, as if the spirit of the girl tore down the dark curtains which  had hung for seventeen years over the windows of her eyes, Naomi saw!    They all knew it at once. It seemed to them as if every feature of the  girl's face had leapt into her eyes; as if the expression of her lips,  her brow, her nostrils, had sprung to them: as if her face, so fair  before, so full of quivering feeling, must have been nothing until then  but a blank. Nay, but they seemed to see her now for the first time.  This, only this, was she!    And to Naomi also, at that moment, it was almost as if she had been  newly born into life. She was meeting the world at last face to face,  eye to eye. Into her darkened chamber, that had never known the light,  everything had entered at a blow--the white glare of the sun, the  blue sky, the tiled patio, the faces of the Kaid and his wife and his  soldiers, and of the old man also, with the unshed tears hanging on the  fringe of his eyelid. She could not realise the marvel. She did not know  what vision was. She had not learned to see. Her trembling soul had gone  out from its dark chamber and met the mighty light in his mansion. “Oh!  oh!” she cried, and stood bewildered and helpless in the midst. The  picture of the world seemed to be falling upon her, and she covered her  eyes with her hands, that she might abolish it altogether.    Israel saw everything. “Naomi!” he cried in a choking voice, and  stretched out his hands to her. Then she uncovered her eyes, and looked,  and paused and hesitated.    “Naomi!” he cried again, and made a step towards her. She covered her  eyes once more that she might shut out the stranger they showed her, and  only listen to the voice that she knew so well. Then she staggered into  her father's arms. And Israel's heart was big, and he gathered her to  his breast, and, turning towards the woman, he said, “Madam, we are  in the hands of God. Look! See! He has sent His angel to protect His  servant.”    Meantime, Ben Aboo was quaking with fear. He too, saw the finger of God  in the wondrous thing which had come to pass. And, falling back on his  maudlin mood, he muttered prayers beneath his breath, as he had done  before when the human majesty, the Sultan Abd er-Rahman, was the object  of his terror. “O Giver of good to all! What is this? Allah save us!  Bismillah! Is it Allah or the Jinoon? Merciful! Compassionate! Curses on  them both! Allah! Allah!”    The soldiers were affected by the fears of the Basha, and they huddled  together in a group. But Katrina fell to laughing.    “Brava!” she cried. “Brava! Oh! a brave imposture! What did I say long  ago? Blind? No more blind than you were! But a pretty pretence! Well  acted! Very well acted! Brava! Brava!”    Thus she laughed and mocked, and the Basha, hearing her, took shame of  his crawling fears, and made a poor show of joining her.    Israel heard them, and for a moment, seeing how they made sport of  Naomi, a fire was kindled in his anger that seemed to come up from the  lowest hell. But he fought back the passion that was mastering him, and  at the next instant the laughter had ceased, and Ben Aboo was saying--    “Guards, take both of them. Set the man on an ass, and let the girl walk  barefoot before him; and let a crier cry beside them, 'So shall it be  done to every man who is an enemy of the Kaid, and to every woman who  is a play-actor and a cheat!' Thus let them pass through the streets and  through the people until they are come to a gate of the town, and then  cast them forth from it like lepers and like dogs!”        CHAPTER XIX      THE RAINBOW SIGN      While this bad work had been going forward in the Kasbah a great  blessing had fallen on the town. The long-looked for, hoped for, prayed  for--the good and blessed rain--had come at last. In gentle drops like  dew it had at first been falling from the rack of dark cloud which had  gathered over the heads of the mountains, and now, after half an hour of  such moisture, the sky over the town was grey, and the rain was pouring  down like a flood.    Oh! the joy of it, the sweetness, the freshness, the beauty, the odour!  The air overhead, which had been dense with dust, was clearing and  whitening as if the water washed it. And the ground underfoot, which  had reeked of creeping and crawling things, was running like a wholesome  river, and bearing back to the lips a taste as of the sea.    And the people of the town, in their surprise and gladness at the  falling of the rain, had come out of their houses to meet it. The  streets and the marketplace were full of them. In childish joy they  wandered up and down in the drenching flood, without fear or thought  of harm, with laughing eyes and gleaming white teeth, holding out their  palms to the rain and drinking it. Hailing each other in the voices of  boys, jesting and shouting and singing, to and fro they went and came  without aim or direction. The Jews trooped out of the Mellah, chattering  like jays, and the Moors at the gate salaamed to them. Mule-drivers  cried “Balak” in tones that seemed to sing; gunsmiths and saddle-makers  sat idle at their doors, greeting every one that passed; solemn Talebs  stood in knots, with faces that shone under the closed hoods of their  dark jellabs; and the bareheaded Berbers encamped in the market-square  capered about like flighty children, grinned like apes, fired their long  guns into the air for love of hearing the powder speak, often wept, and  sometimes embraced each other, thinking of their homes that were far  away.    Now, it was just when the town was alive with this strange scene that  the procession which had been ordered by Ben Aboo came out from  the Kasbah. At the head of it walked a soldier, staff in hand and  gorgeous--notwithstanding the rain--in peaked shasheeah and crimson  selham. Behind him were four black police, and on either side of the  company were two criers of the street, each carrying a short staff  festooned with strings of copper coin, which he rattled in the air for a  bell. Between these came the victims of the Basha's order--Naomi first,  barefooted, bareheaded, stripped of all but the last garment that  hid her nakedness, her head held down, her face hidden, and her eyes  closed--and Israel afterwards, mounted on a lean and ragged ass. A  further guard of black police walked at the back of all. Thus they came  down the steep arcades into the market-square, where the greater body of  the townspeople had gathered together.    When the people saw them, they made for them, hastening in crowds from  every side of the Feddan, from every adjacent alley, every shop, tent,  and booth. And when they saw who the prisoners were they burst into loud  exclamations of surprise.    “Ya Allah! Israel the Jew!” cried the Moors.    “God of Jacob, save us! Israel ben Oliel!” cried the people of the  Mellah.    “What is it? What has happened? What has befallen them?” they all asked  together.    “Balak!” cried the soldier in front, swinging his staff before him to  force a passage through the thronging multitude. “Attention! By your  leave! Away! Out of the way!”    And as they walked the criers chanted, “So shall it be done to every man  who is an enemy of the Kaid, and to every woman who is a play-actor and  a cheat.”    When the people had recovered from their consternation they began to  look black into each other's face, to mutter oaths between their teeth,  and to say in voices of no pity or rush, “He deserved it!” “Ya Allah,  but he's well served!” “Holy Saints, we knew what it would come to!”   “Look at him now!” “There he is at last!” “Brave end to all his great  doings!” “Curse him! Curse him!”    And over the muttered oaths and pitiless curses, the yelping and barking  of the cruel voices of the crowd, as the procession moved along, came  still the cry of the crier, “So shall it be done to every man who is an  enemy of the Kaid, and to every woman who is a play-actor and a cheat.”    Then the mood of the multitude changed. The people began to titter,  and after that to laugh openly. They wagged their heads at Israel; they  derided him; they made merry over his sorry plight. Where he was now  he seemed to be not so much a fallen tyrant as a silly sham and an  imposture. Look at him! Look at his bony and ragged ass! Ya Allah! To  think that they had ever been afraid of him!    As the procession crossed the market-place, a woman who was enveloped in  a blanket spat at Israel as he passed. Then it was come to the door of  the Mosque, an old man, a beggar, hobbled through the crowd and struck  Israel with the back of his hand across the face. The woman had lost her  husband and the man his son by death sentences of Ben Aboo. Israel  had succoured both when he went about on his secret excursions after  nightfall in the disguise of a Moor.    “Balak! Balak!” cried the soldier in front, and still the chant of the  crier rang out over all other noises.    At every step the throng increased. The strong and lusty bore down the  weak in the struggle to get near to the procession. Blind beggars and  feeble cripples who could not see or stir shouted hideous oaths at  Israel from the back of the crowd.    As the procession went past the gates of the Mellah, two companies came  out into the town. The one was a company of soldiers returning to  the Kasbah after sacking and wrecking Israel's house; the other was a  company of old Jews, among whom were Reuben Maliki, Abraham Pigman, and  Judah ben Lolo. At the advent of the three usurers a new impulse seized  the people. They pretended to take the procession for a triumphal  progress--the departure of a Kaid, a Shereef, a Sultan. The soldier  and police fell into the humour of the multitude. Salaams were made  to Israel; selhams were flung on the ground before the feet of Naomi.  Reuben Maliki pushed through the crowd, and walked backward, and cried,  in his harsh, nasal croak--    “Brothers of Tetuan, behold your benefactor! Make way for him! Make way!  make way!”    Then there were loud guffaws, and oaths, and cries like the cry of the  hyena. Last of all, old Abraham Pigman handed over the people's heads a  huge green Spanish umbrella to a negro farrier that walked within; and  the black fellow, showing his white teeth in a wide grim, held it over  Israel's head.    Then from fifty rasping throats came mocking cries.    “God bless our Lord!”    “Saviour of his people!”    “Benefactor! King of men!”    And over and between these cries came shrieks and yells of laughter.    All this time Israel had sat motionless on his ass, neither showing  humiliation nor fear. His face was worn and ashy, but his eyes burned  with a piteous fire. He looked up and saw everything; saw himself mocked  by the soldier and the crier, insulted by the Muslimeen, derided by the  Jews, spat upon and smitten by the people whose hungry mouths he had fed  with bread. Above all, he saw Naomi going before him in her shame, and  at that sight his heart bled and his spirit burred. And, thinking that  it was he who had brought her to this ignominy, he sometimes yearned to  reach her side and whisper in her ear, and say, “Forgive me, my child,  forgive me.” But again he conquered the desire, for he remembered  what God had that day done for her; and taking it for a sign of God's  pleasure, and a warranty that he had done well, he raised his eyes on  her with tears of bitter joy, and thought, in the wild fever of his  soul, “She is sharing the triumph of my humiliation. She is walking  through the mocking and jeering crowd, but see! God Himself is walking  beside her!”    The procession had now come to the walled lane to the Bab Toot, the gate  going out to Tangier and to Shawan. There the way was so narrow and the  concourse so great that for a moment the procession was brought to a  stand. Seizing this opportunity, Reuben Maliki stepped up to Israel and  said, so that all might hear, “Look at the crowds that have come out to  speed you, O saviour of your people! Look! look! We shall all remember  this day!”    “So you shall!” cried Israel. “Until your days of death you shall all  remember it!”    He had not spoken before, and some of the Moors tried to laugh at his  answer; but his voice, which was like a frenzied cry, went to the hearts  of the Jews, and many of them fell away from the crowd straightway, and  followed it no farther. It was the cry of the voice of a brother. They  had been insulting calamity itself.    “Balak!” shouted the soldier, and the crier cried once more, and the  procession moved again.    It was the hour of Israel's last temptation. Not a glance in his face  disclosed passion, but his heart was afire. The devil seemed to be  jarring at his ear, “Look! Listen! Is it for people like these that you  have come to this? Were they worth the sacrifice? You might have been  rich and great, and riding on their heads. They would have honoured you  then, but now they despise you. Fool! You have sold all and given to the  poor, and this is the end of it.” But in the throes and last gasp of his  agony, hearing his voice in his ear, and seeing Naomi going barefooted  on the stones before him, an angel seemed to come to him and whisper,  “Be strong. Only a little longer. Finish as you have begun. Well done,  servant of God, well done!”    He did not flinch, but rode on without a word or a cry. Once he lifted  his head and looked down at the steaming, gaping, grinning cauldron  of faces black and white. “O pity of men!” he thought. “What devil is  tempting _them_?”    By this time the procession had come to the town walls at a point near  to the Bab Toot. No one had observed until then that the rain was no  longer falling, but now everybody was made aware of this at once by  sight of a rainbow which spanned the sky to the north-west immediately  over the arch of the gate.    Israel saw the rainbow, and took it for a sign. It was God's hand in the  heavens. To this gate then, and through it, out of Tetuan, into the land  beyond--the plains, the hills, the desert where no man was wronged--God  Himself, and not these people, had that day been leading them!    What happened next Israel never rightly knew. His proper sense of life  seemed lost. Through thick waves of hot air he heard many voices.    First the voice of the crier, “So shall it be done to every man who  is an enemy of the Kaid, and to every woman who is a play-actor and a  cheat.”    Then the voice of the soldier, “Balak! Balak!”    After that a multitudinous din that seemed to break off sharply and then  to come muffled and dense as from the other side of the closed gate.    When Israel came to himself again he was walking on a barren heath that  was dotted over with clumps of the long aloe, and he was holding Naomi  by the hand.        CHAPTER XX      LIFE'S NEW LANGUAGE    Two days after they had been cast out of Tetuan, Israel and Naomi were  settled in a little house that stood a day's walk to the north of the  town, about midway between the village of Semsa and the fondak which  lies on the road to Tangier. From the hour wherein the gates had closed  behind them, everything had gone well with both. The country people who  lay encamped on the heath outside had gathered around and shown them  kindness. One old Arab woman, seeing Naomi's shame, had come behind  without a word and cast a blanket over her head and shoulders. Then  a girl of the Berber folk had brought slippers and drawn them on to  Naomi's feet. The woman wore no blanket herself, and the feet of the  girl were bare. Their own people were haggard and hollow-eyed and  hungry, but the hearts of all were melted towards the great man in his  dark hour. “Allah had written it,” they muttered, but they were more  merciful than they thought their God.    Thus, amid silent pity and audible peace-blessings, with cheer of kind  words and comfort of food and drink, Israel and Naomi had wandered on  through the country from village to village, until in the evening, an  hour after sundown, they came upon the hut wherein they made their home.  It was a poor, mean place--neither a round tent, such as the mountain  Berbers build, nor a square cube of white stone, with its garden in a  court within, such as a Moorish farmer rears for his homestead, but an  oblong shed, roofed with rushes and palmetto leaves in the manner of an  Irish cabin. And, indeed, the cabin of an Irish renegade it had been,  who, escaping at Gibraltar from the ship that was taking him to Sidney,  had sailed in a Genoese trader to Ceuta, and made his way across the  land until he came to this lonesome spot near to Semsa. Unlike the  better part of his countrymen, he had been a man of solitary habit and  gloomy temper, and while he lived he had been shunned by his neighbours,  and when he died his house had been left alone. That was the chance  whereby Israel and Naomi had come to possess it, being both poor and  unclaimed.    Nevertheless, though bare enough of most things that man makes and  values, yet the little place was rich in some of the wealth that comes  only from the hand of God. Thus marjoram and jasmine and pinks and roses  grew at the foot of its walls, and it was these sweet flowers which had  first caught the eyes of Israel. For suddenly through the mazes of his  mind, where every perception was indistinct at that time, there seemed  to come back to him a vague and confused recollection of the abandoned  house, as if the thing that his eyes then saw they had surely seen  before. How this should be Israel could not tell, seeing that never  before to his knowledge had he passed on his way to Tangier so near to  Semsa. But when he questioned himself again, it came to him, like light  beaming into a dark room, that not in any waking hour at all had he seen  the little place before, but in a dream of the night when he slept on  the ground in the poor fondak of the Jews at Wazzan.    This, then, was the cottage where he had dreamed that he lived with  Naomi; this was where she had seemed to have eyes to see and ears to  hear and a tongue to speak; this was the vision of his dead wife, which  when he awoke on his journey had appeared to be vainly reflected in  his dream; and now it was realised, it was true, it had come to pass.  Israel's heart was full, and being at that time ready to see the leading  of Heaven in everything, he saw it in this fact also; and thus, without  more ado than such inquiries as were necessary, he settled himself with  Naomi in the place they had chanced upon.    And there, through some months following, from the height of the summer  until the falling of winter, they lived together in peace and content,  lacking much, yet wanting nothing; short of many things that are thought  to make men's condition happy, but grateful and thanking God.    Israel was poor, but not penniless. Out of the wreck of his fortune,  after he sold the best contents of his house, he had still some three  hundred dollars remaining in the pocket of his waistband when he was  cast out of the town. These he laid out in sheep and goats and oxen. He  hired land also of a tenant of the Basha, and sent wool and milk by the  hand of a neighbour to the market at Tetuan. The rains continued, the  eggs of the locust were destroyed, the grass came green out of the  ground, and Israel found bread for both of them. With such simple  husbandry, and in such a home, giving no thought to the morrow, he  passed with cheer and comfort from day to day.    And truly, if at any weaker moment he had been minded to repine for the  loss of his former poor greatness, or to fail of heart in pursuit of  his new calling, for which heavier hands were better fit, he had always  present with him two bulwarks of his purpose and sheet-anchors of his  hope. He was reminded of the one as often as in the daytime he climbed  the hillside above his little dwelling and saw the white town lying far  away under its gauzy canopy of mist, and whenever in the night the town  lamps sent their pale sheet of light into the dark sky.    “They are yonder,” he would think, “wrangling, contending, fighting,  praying, cursing, blessing, and cheating; and I am here, cut off from  them by ten deep miles of darkness, in the quiet, the silence, and sweet  odour of God's proper air.”    But stronger to sustain him than any memory of the ways of his former  life was the recollection of Naomi. God had given back all her gifts,  and what were poverty and hard toil against so great a blessing? They  were as dust, they were as ashes, they were what power of the world and  riches of gold and silver had been without it. And higher than the joy  of Israel's constant remembrance that Naomi had been blind and could now  see, and deaf and could now hear, and dumb and could now speak, was  the solemn thought that all this was but the sign and symbol of God's  pleasure and assurance to his soul that the lot of the scapegoat had  been lifted away.    More satisfying still to the hunger of his heart as a man was his  delicious pleasure in Naomi's new-found life. She was like a creature  born afresh, a radiant and joyful being newly awakened into a world of  strange sights.    But it was not at once that she fell upon this pleasure. What had  happened to her was, after all, a simple thing. Born with cataract on  the pupils of her eyes, the emotion of the moment at the Kasbah, when  her father's life seemed to be once more in danger, had--like a fall  or a blow--luxated the lens and left the pupils clear. That was all.  Throughout the day whereon the last of her great gifts came to her, when  they were cast out of Tetuan, and while they walked hand in hand through  the country until they lit upon their home, she had kept her eyes  steadfastly closed. The light terrified her. It penetrated her delicate  lids, and gave her pain. When for a moment she lifted her lashes and saw  the trees, she put out her hand as if to push them away; and when she  saw the sky, she raised her arms as if to hold it off. Everything seemed  to touch her eyes. The bars of sunlight seemed to smite them. Not until  the falling of darkness did her fears subside and her spirits revive.  Throughout the day that followed she sat constantly in the gloom of the  blackest corner of their hut.    But this was only her baptism of light on coming out of a world of  darkness, just as her fear of the voices of the earth and air had been  her baptism of sound on coming out of a land of silence. Within three  days afterwards her terror began to give place to joy; and from that  time forward the world was full of wonder to her opened eyes. Then  sweet and beautiful, beyond all dreams of fancy, were her amazement and  delight in every little thing that lay about her--the grass, the weeds,  the poorest flower that blew, even the rude implements of the house and  the common stones that worked up through the mould--all old and familiar  to her fingers, but new and strange to her eyes, and marvellous as if an  angel out of heaven had dropped them down to her.    For many days after the coming of her sight she continued to recognise  everything by touch and sound. Thus one morning early in their life in  the cottage, and early also in the day, after Israel had kissed her on  the eyelids to awaken her, and she had opened them and gazed up at him  as he stooped above her, she looked puzzled for an instant, being still  in the mists of sleep, and only when she had closed her eyes again, and  put out her hand to touch him, did her face brighten with recognition  and her lips utter his name. “My father,” she murmured, “my father.”    Thus again, the same day, not an hour afterwards, she came running back  to the house from the grass bank in front of it, holding a flower in her  hand, and asking a world of hot questions concerning it in her broken,  lisping, pretty speech. Why had no one told her that there were flowers  that could see? Here was one which while she looked upon it had opened  its beautiful eye and laughed at her. “What is it?” she asked; “what is  it?”    “A daisy, my child,” Israel answered.    “A daisy!” she cried in bewilderment; and during the short hush and  quick inspiration that followed she closed her eyes and passed her  nervous fingers rapidly over the little ring of sprinkled spears, and  then said very softly, with head aslant as if ashamed, “Oh, yes, so it  is; it is only a daisy.”    But to tell of how those first days of sight sped along for Naomi, with  what delight of ever-fresh surprise, and joy of new wonder, would be a  long task if a beautiful one. They were some miles inside the coast, but  from the little hill-top near at hand they could see it clearly; and one  day when Naomi had gone so far with her father, she drew up suddenly  at his side, and cried in a breathless voice of awe, “The sky! the sky!  Look! It has fallen on to the land.”    “That is the sea, my child,” said Israel.    “The sea!” she cried, and then she closed her eyes and listened, and  then opened them and blushed and said, while her knitted brows smoothed  out and her beautiful face looked aside, “So it is--yes, it is the sea.”    Throughout that day and the night which followed it the eyes of her  mind were entranced by the marvel of that vision, and next morning she  mounted the hill alone, to look upon it again; and, being so far, she  walked farther and yet farther, wandering on and on, through fields  where lavender grew and chamomile blossomed, on and on, as though drawn  by the enchantment of the mighty deep that lay sparkling in the sun,  until at last she came to the head of a deep gully in the coast. Still  the wonder of the waters held her, but another marvel now seized  upon her sight. The gully was a lonesome place inhabited by countless  sea-birds. From high up in the rocks above, and from far down in the  chasm below, from every cleft on every side, they flew out, with white  wings and black ones and grey and blue, and sent their voices into the  air, until the echoing place seemed to shriek and yell with a deafening  clangour.    It was midday when Naomi reached this spot, and she sat there a long  hour in fear and consternation. And when she returned to her father, she  told him awesome stories of demons that lived in thousands by the sea,  and fought in the air and killed each other. “And see!” she cried; “look  at this, and this, and this!”    Then Israel glanced at the wrecks she had brought with her of the  devilish warfare that she had witnessed and “This,” said he, lifting  one of them, “is a sea-bird's feather; and this,” lifting another, “is  a sea-bird's egg; and this,” lifting the third, “is a dead sea-bird  itself.”    Once more Naomi knit her brows in thought, and again she closed her eyes  and touched the familiar things wherein her sight had deceived her.  “Ah yes,” she said meekly, looking into her father's eye, with a smile,  “they are only that after all.” And then she said very quietly, as if  speaking to herself, “What a long time it is before you learn to see!”    It was partly due to the isolation of her upbringing in the company of  Israel that nearly every fresh wonder that encountered her eyes took  shapes of supernatural horror or splendour. One early evening, when she  had remained out of the house until the day was well-nigh done, she came  back in a wild ecstasy to tell of angels that she had just seen in the  sky. They were in robes of crimson and scarlet, their wings blazed like  fire, they swept across the clouds in multitudes, and went down behind  the world together, passing out of the earth through the gates of  heaven.    Israel listened to her and said, “That was the sunset my child. Every  morning the sun rises and every night it sets.”    Then she looked full into his face and blushed. Her shame at her sweet  errors sometimes conquered her joy in the new heritage of sight, and  Israel heard her whisper to herself and say, “After all, the eyes are  deceitful.” Vision was life's new language, and she had yet to learn it.    But not for long was her delight in the beautiful things of the world  to be damped by any thought of herself. Nay, the best and rarest part of  it, the dearest and most delicious throb it brought her, came of herself  alone. On another early day Israel took her to the coast, and pushed off  with her on the waters in a boat. The air was still, the sea was smooth,  the sun was shining, and save for one white scarf of cloud the sky  was blue. They were sailing in a tiny bay that was broken by a little  island, which lay in the midst like a ruby in a ring, covered with  heather and long stalks of seeding grass. Through whispering beds of  rushes they glided on, and floated over banks of coral where gleaming  fishes were at play. Sea-fowl screamed over their heads, as if in anger  at their invasion, and under their oars the moss lay in the shallows on  the pebbles and great stones. It was a morning of God's own making, and,  for joy of its loveliness no less than of her own bounding life, Naomi  rose in the boat and opened her lips and arms to the breeze while it  played with the rippling currents of her hair, as if she would drink and  embrace it.    At that moment a new and dearer wonder came to her, such as every maiden  knows whom God has made beautiful, yet none remembers the hour when she  knew it first. For, tracing with her eyes the shadow of the cliff and of  the continent of cloud that sailed double in two seas of blue to where  they were broken by the dazzling half-round of the sun's reflected disc  on the shadowed quarter of the boat, she leaned over the side of it, and  then saw the reflection of another and lovelier vision.    “Father,” she cried with alarm, “a face in the water! Look! look!”    “It is your own, my child,” said Israel. “Mine!” she cried.    “The reflection of your face,” said Israel; “the light and the water  make it.”    The marvel was hard to understand. There was something ghostly in this  thing that was herself and yet not herself, this face that looked up at  her and laughed and yet made no voice. She leaned back in the boat and  asked Israel if it was still in the water. But when at length she had  grasped the mystery, the artlessness of her joy was charming. She was  like a child in her delight, and like a woman that was still a child  in her unconscious love of her own loveliness. Whenever the boat was at  rest she leaned over its bulwark and gazed down into the blue depths.    “How beautiful!” she cried, “how beautiful!”    She clapped her hands and looked again, and there in the still water  was the wonder of her dancing eyes. “Oh! how very beautiful!” she cried  without lifting her face, and when she saw her lips move as she spoke  and her sunny hair fall about her restless head she laughed and laughed  again with a heart of glee.    Israel looked on for some moments at this sweet picture, and, for all  his sense of the dangers of Naomi's artless joy in her own beauty, he  could not find it in his heart to check her. He had borne too long  the pain and shame of one who was father of an afflicted child to deny  himself this choking rapture of her recovery. “Live on like a child  always, little one,” he thought; “be a child as long as you can, be a  child for ever, my dove, my darling! Never did the world suffer it that  I myself should be a child at all.”    The artlessness of Naomi increased day by day, and found constantly  some new fashion of charming strangeness. All lovely things on the  earth seemed to speak to her, and she could talk with the birds and the  flowers. Also she would lie down in the grass and rest like a lamb, with  as little shame and with a grace as sweet. Not yet had the great mystery  dawned that drops on a girl like an unseen mantle out of the sky, and  when it has covered her she is a child no more. Naomi was a child still.  Nay, she was a child a second time, for while she had been blind she had  seemed for a little while to become a woman in the awful revelation of  her infirmity and isolation. Now she was a weak, patient, blind maiden  no longer, but a reckless spirit of joy once again, a restless gleam of  human sunlight gathering sunshine into her father's house.    It was fit and beautiful that she who had lived so long without the  better part of the gifts of God should enjoy some of them at length  in rare perfection. Her sight was strong and her hearing was keen, but  voice was the gift which she had in abundance. So sweet, so full, so  deep, so soft a voice as Naomi's came to be, Israel thought he had never  heard before. Ruth's voice? Yes, but fraught with inspiration, replete  with sparkling life, and passionate with the notes of a joyous heart.  All day long Naomi used it. She sang as she rose in the morning, and was  still singing when she lay down at night. Wherever people came upon her,  they came first upon the sound of her voice. The farmers heard it across  the fields, and sometimes Israel heard it from over the hill by their  hut. Often she seemed to them like a bird that is hidden in a tree, and  only known to be there by the outbursts of its song.    Fatimah's ditties were still her delight. Some of them fell strangely  from her pure lips, so nearly did they border on the dangerous. But her  favourite song was still her mother's:--         Oh, come and claim thine own,       Oh, come and take thy throne,       Reign ever and alone       Reign glorious, golden Love.    Into these words, as her voice ripened, she seemed to pour a deeper  fervour. She was as innocent as a child of their meaning, but it was  almost as if she were fulfilling in some way a law of her nature as a  maid and drifting blindly towards the dawn of Love. Never did she think  of Love, but it was just as if Love were always thinking of her; it was  even as if the spirit of Love were hovering over her constantly, and she  were walking in the way of its outstretched wings.    Israel saw this, and it set him to chasing day-dreams that were like  the drawing up of a curtain. A beautiful phantom of Naomi's future  would rise up before him. Love had come to her. The great mystery! the  rapture, the blissful wonder, the dear, secret, delicious palpitating  joy. He knew it must come some day--perhaps to day, perhaps to-morrow.  And when it came it would be like a sixth sense.    In quieter moments--generally at night, when he would take a candle and  look at her where she lay asleep--Israel would carry his dreams into  Naomi's future one stage farther, and see her in the first dawn of young  motherhood. Her delicate face of pink an cream; her glance of pride and  joy and yearning, an then the thrill of the little spreading red fingers  fastening on her white bosom--oh, what a glimpse was there revealed to  him!    But struggle as he would to find pleasure in these phantoms, he could  not help but feel pain from them also. They had a perilous fascination  for him, but he grudged them to Naomi. He thought he could have given  his immortal soul to her, but these shadows he could not give. That was  his poor tribute to human selfishness; his last tender, jealous frailty  as a father. He dreaded the coming of that time when another--some other  yet unseen--should come before him, and he should lose the daughter that  was now his own.    Sometimes the memory of their old troubles in Tetuan seemed to cross  like a thundercloud the azure of Naomi's sky, but at the next hour it  was gone. The world was too full of marvels for any enduring sense  but wonder. Once she awoke from sleep in terror, and told Israel of  something which she believed to have happened to her in the night. She  had been carried away from him--she could not say when--and she knew  no more until she found herself in a great patio, paved and wailed with  tiles. Men were standing together there in red peaked caps and flowing  white kaftans. And before them all was one old man in garments that  were of the colour of the afternoon sun, with sleeves like the mouths of  bells, a curling silver knife at his waistband, and little leather bags  hung by yellow cords about his neck. Beside this man there was a woman  of a laughing cruel face; and she herself, Naomi--alone her father being  nowhere near--stood in the midst with all eyes upon her. What happened  next she did not know, for blank darkness fell upon everything, and in  that interval they who had taken her away must have brought her back.  For when she opened her eyes she was in her own bed, and the things of  their little home were about her, and her father's eyes were looking  down at her, and his lips were kissing her, and the sun was shining  outside, and the birds were singing, and the long grass was whispering  in the breeze, and it was the same as if she had been asleep during the  night and was just awakening in the morning.    “It was a dream, my child,” said Israel, thinking only with how vivid  a sense her eyes had gathered up in that instant of first sight the  picture of that day at the Kasbah.    “A dream!” she cried; “no, no! I _saw_ it!”    Hitherto her dreams had been blind ones, and if she dreamt of her own  people it had not been of their faces, but of the touch of their hands  or the sound of their voices. By one of these she had always known them,  and sometimes it had been her mother's arms that had been about her, and  sometimes her father's lips that had pressed her forehead, and sometimes  Ali's voice that had rung in her ears.    Israel smoothed her hair and calmed her fears, but thinking both of her  dream and of her artless sayings, he said in his heart, “She is a child,  a child born into life as a maid, and without the strength of a child's  weakness. Oh! great is the wisdom which orders it so that we come into  the world as babes.”    Thus realising Naomi's childishness, Israel kept close guard and watch  upon her afterwards. But if she was a gleam of sunlight in his lonely  dwelling, like sunlight she came and went in it, and one day he found  her near to the track leading up to the fondak in talk with a passing  traveller by the way, whom he recognised for the grossest profligate out  of Tetuan. Unveiled, unabashed, with sweet looks of confidence she was  gazing full into the man's gross face, answering his evil questions with  the artless simplicity of innocence. At one bound Israel was between  them; and in a moment he had torn Naomi away. And that night, while she  wept out her very heart at the first anger that her father had shown  her, Israel himself, in a new terror of his soul, was pouring out a new  petition to God. “O Lord, my God,” he cried, “when she was blind and  dumb and deaf she was a thing apart, she was a child in no peril from  herself for Thy hand did guide her, and in none from the world, for no  man dared outrage her infirmity. But now she is a maid, and her dangers  are many, for she is beautiful, and the heart of man is evil. Keep me  with her always, O Lord, to guard and guide her! Let me not leave her,  for she is without knowledge of good and evil. Spare me a little  while longer, though I am stricken in years. For her sake spare me, Oh  Lord--it is the last of my prayers--the last, O Lord, the last--for her  sake spare me!”    God did not hear the prayer of Israel. Next morning a guard of soldiers  came out from Tetuan and took him prisoner in the name of the Kaid. The  release of the poor followers of Absalam out of the prison at Shawan had  become known by the blind gratitude of one of them, who, hastening to  Israel's house in the Mellah, had flung himself down on his face before  it.        CHAPTER XXI    ISRAEL IN PRISON      Short as the time was--some three months and odd days--since the prison  at Shawan had been emptied by order of the warrant which Israel had  sealed without authority in the name of Ben Aboo, it was now occupied  by other prisoners. The remoteness of the town in the territory of  the Akhmas, and the wild fanaticism of the Shawanis, had made the  old fortress a favourite place of banishment to such Kaids of other  provinces as looked for heavier ransoms from the relatives of victims,  because the locality of their imprisonment was unknown or the danger  of approaching it was terrible. And thus it happened that some fifty or  more men and boys from near and far were already living in the dungeon  from which Israel and Ali together had set the other prisoners free.    This was the prison to which Israel was taken when he was torn from  Naomi and the simple home that he had made for himself near Semsa.  “Ya Allah! Let the dog eat the crust which he thought too hard for his  pups!” said Ben Aboo, as he sealed the warrant which consigned Israel to  the Kaid of Shawan.    Israel was taken to the prison afoot, and reached it on the morning of  the second day after his arrest. The sun was shining as he approached  the rude old block of masonry and entered the passage that led down  to the dungeon. In a little court at the door of the place the Kaid el  habs, the jailer, was sitting on a mattress, which served him for chair  by day and bed by night. He was amusing himself with a ginbri, playing  loud and low according as the tumult was great or little which came from  the other side of a barred and knotted doorway behind him, some four  feet high, and having a round peephole in the upper part of it. On the  wall above hung leather thongs, and a long Reefian flintlock stood in  the corner.    At Israel's approach there were some facetious comments between the  jailer and the guard. Why the ginbri? Was he practising for the fires  of Jehinnum? Was he to fiddle for the Jinoon? Well, what was a man to do  while the dogs inside were snarling? Were the thongs for the correction  of persons lacking understanding? Why, yes; everybody knew their old  saying, “A hint to the wise, a blow to the fool.”    A bunch of great keys rattled, the low doorway was thrown open, Israel  stooped and went in, the door closed behind him, the footsteps of the  guard died away, and the twang of the ginbri began again.    The prison was dark and noisome, some sixty feet long by half as many  broad, supported by arches resting on rotten pillars, lighted only by  narrow clefts at either hand, exuding damp from its walls, dropping  moisture from its roof, its air full of vermin, and its floor reeking of  filth. And only less horrible than the prison itself was the condition  of the prisoners. Nearly all wore iron fetters on their legs, and some  were shackled to the pillars. At one side a little group of them--they  were Shereefs from Wazzan--were conversing eagerly and gesticulating  wildly; and at the other side a larger company--they were Jews from  Fez--were languidly twisting palmetto leaves into the shape of baskets.  Four Berbers at the farther end were playing cards, and two Arabs that  were chained to a column near the door squatted on the ground with a  battered old draughtboard between them. From both groups of players  came loud shouts and laughter and a running fire of expostulation and  of indignant and sarcastic comment. Down went the cards with triumphant  bangs, and the moves of the “dogs” were like lightning. First a mocking  voice: “_You_ call yourself a player! There!--there!--there!” Then a  meek, piping tone: “So--so--verily, you are my master. Well, let us  praise Allah for your wisdom.” But soon a wild burst of irony: “You are  like him who killed the dog and fell into the river. See! thus I teach  you to boast over your betters! I shave your beard! There!--there!--and  there!”    In the middle of the reeking floor, so placed that the thin shaft of  light from the clefts at the ends might fall on them--a barber-doctor  was bleeding a youth from a vein in the arm. “We're all having it done,”   he was saying. “It's good for the internals. I did it to a shipload of  pilgrims once.” A wild-looking creature sat in a corner--he was a saint,  a madman, of the sect of the Darkaoa--rocking himself to and fro, and  crying “Allah! All-lah! All-l-lah! All-l-l-lah!” Near to this person  a haggard old man of the Grega sect was shaking and dancing at his  prayers. And not far from either a Mukaddam, a high-priest of the Aissa,  brotherhood--a juggler who had travelled through the country with a lion  by a halter--was singing a frantic mockery of a Christian hymn to a tune  that he had heard on the coast.    Such was the scene of Israel's imprisonment, and such were the  companions that were to share it. There had been a moment's pause in  the clamour of their babel as the door opened and Israel entered. The  prisoners knew him, and they were aghast. Every eye looked up and every  mouth was agape. Israel stood for a time with the closed door behind  him. He looked around, made a step forward, hesitated, seemed to peer  vainly through the darkness for bed or mattress, and then sat down  helplessly by a pillar on the ground.    A young negro in a coarse jellab went up to him and offered a bit of  bread. “Hungry, brother? No?” said the youth. “Cheer up, Sidi! No good  letting the donkey ride on your head!”    This person was the Irishman of the company--a happy, reckless,  facetious dog, who had lost little save his liberty and cared nothing  for his life, but laughed and cheated and joked and made doggerel songs  on every disaster that befell them. He made one song on himself--         El Arby was a black man       They called him “'Larby Kosk:”        He loved the wives of the Kasbah,       And stole slippers in the Mosque.    Israel was stunned. Since his arrest he had scarcely spoken. “Stay  here,” he had said to Naomi when the first outburst of her grief was  quelled; “never leave this place. Whatever they say, stay here. I will  come back.” After that he had been like a man who was dumb. Neither  insult nor tyranny had availed to force a word or a cry out of him.  He had walked on in silence doggedly, hardly once glancing up into the  faces of his guard, and never breaking his fast save with a draught of  water by the way.    At Shawan, as elsewhere in Barbary, the prisoners were supported by  their own relatives and friends, and on the day after Israel's arrival a  number of women and children came to the prison with provisions. It was  a wild and gruesome scene that followed. First, the frantic search of  the prisoners for their wives and sons and daughters, and their wild  shouts as each one found his own. “Blessed be God! She's here! here!”   Then the maddening cries of the prisoners whose relatives had not come.  “My Ayesha! Where is she? Curses on her mother! Why isn't she here?”   After that the shrieks of despair from such as learned that their  breadwinners were dying off one by one. “Dead, you say?” “Dead!” “No,  no!” “Yes, yes!” “No, no, I say!” “I say yes! God forgive me! died  last week. But don't you die too. Here take this bag of zummetta.” Then  inquiries after absent children. “Little Selam, where is he?” “Begging  in Tetuan.” “Poor boy! poor boy! And pretty M'barka, what of her?”   “Alas! M'barka's a public woman now in Hoolia's house at Marrakesh. No,  don't curse her, Jellali; the poor child was driven to it. What were we  to do with the children crying for bread? And then there was nothing to  fetch you this journey, Jellali.” “I'll not eat it now it's brought. My  boy a beggar and my girl a harlot? By Allah! May the Kaid that keeps me  here roast alive in the fires of hell!” Then, apart in one quiet corner,  a young Moor of Tangier eating rice out of the lap of his beautiful  young wife. “You'll not be long coming again, dearest?” he whispers. She  wipes her eyes and stammers, “No--that is--well--” “What's amiss?” “Ali,  I must tell you--” “Well?” “Old Aaron Zaggoory says I must marry him, or  he'll see that both of us starve.” “Allah! And you--_you_?” “Don't look  at me like that, Ali; the hunger is on me, and whatever happens I--I can  love nobody else.” “Curses on Aaron Zaggoory! Curses on you! Curses on  everybody!”    No one had come with food for Israel, and seeing this 'Larby the negro  swaggered up to him, singing a snatch and offering a round cake of  bread--         Rusks are good and kiks are sweet       And kesksoo is both meat and drink;       It's this for now, and that for then,       But khalia still for married men.    “You're like me, Sidi,” he said, “you want nothing,” and he made an  upward movement of his forefinger to indicate his trust in Providence.  That was the gay rascal's way of saying that he stole from the bags of  his comrades while they slept.    “No? Fasting yet?” he said, and went off singing as he came--         It will make your ladies love you;       It will make them coo and kiss--    “What?” he shouted to some one across the prison “eating khalia in the  bird-cage? Bad, bad, bad!”    All this came to Israel's mind through thick waves of  half-consciousness, but with his heart he heard nothing, or the very air  of the place must have poisoned him. He sat by the pillar at which he  had first placed himself, and hardly ever rose from it. With great slow  eyes he gazed at everything, but nothing did he see. Sometimes he had  the look of one who listens, but never did he hear. Thus in silence and  languor he passed from day to day, and from night to night, scarcely  sleeping, rarely eating, and seeming always to be waiting, waiting,  waiting.    Fresh prisoners came at short intervals, and then only was Israel's  interest awakened. One question he asked of all. “Where from?” If they  answered from Fez, from Wazzan, from Mequinez, or from Marrakesh, Israel  turned aside and left them without more words. Then to his fellows they  might pour out their woes in loud wails and curses, but Israel would  hear no more.    Strangers from Europe travelling through the country were allowed to  look into the prison through the round peephole of the door kept by the  Kaid el habs, who played the ginbri. The Jews who made baskets took this  opportunity to offer their work for sale; and so that he might see the  visitors and speak with them Israel would snatch up something and hang  it out. Always his question was the same. “Where from last?” he would  say in English, or Spanish, or French, or Moorish. Sometimes it chanced  that the strangers knew him. But he showed no shame. Never did their  answers satisfy him. He would turn back to his pillar with a sigh.    Thus weeks went on, and Israel's face grew worn and tired. His fellow  prisoners began to show him deference in their own rude way. When he  came among them at the first they had grinned and laughed a little.  To do that was always the impulse of the poor souls, so miserably  imprisoned, when a new comrade joined him. But the majesty and the  suffering in Israel's face told on their hearts at last. He was a great  man fallen, he had nothing left to him; not even bread to eat or water  to drink. So they gathered about him and hit on a way to make him share  their food. Bringing their sacks to his pillar, they stacked them about  it, and asked him to serve out provisions to all, day by day, share and  share alike. He was honest, he was a master, no one would steal from  him, it was best, the stuff would last longest. It was a touching sight.    Still the old eagerness betrayed itself in Israel's weary manner as  often as the door opened and fresh prisoners arrived. Once it happened  that before he uttered his usual question he saw that the newcomers  were from Tetuan, and then his restlessness was feverish. “When--were  you--have you been of late--” he stammered, and seemed unable to go  farther.    But the Tetawanis knew and understood him. “No,” said one in answer to  the unspoken question; “Nor I,” said another; “Nor I,” said a third,  “Nor I neither,” said a fourth, as Israel's rapid eyes passed down the  line of them.    He turned away without a word more, sat down by the pillar and looked  vacantly before him while the new prisoners told their story. Ben Aboo  was a villain. The people of Tetuan had found him out. His wife was a  harlot whose heart was a deep pit. Between them they were demoralising  the entire bashalic. The town was worse than Sodom. Hardly a child in  the streets was safe, and no woman, whether wife or daughter, whom God  had made comely, dare show herself on the roofs. Their own women  had been carried off to the palace at the Kasbah. That was why they  themselves were there in prison.    This was about a month after the coming of Israel to Shawan. Then his  reason began to unsettle. It was pitiful to see that he was conscious of  the change that was befalling him. He wrestled with madness with all the  strength of a strong man. If it should fall upon him, where then would  be his hope and outlook? His day would be done, his night would be  closed in, he would be no more than a helpless log, rolling in an  ice-bound sea, and when the thaw came--if it ever came--he would be  only a broken, rudderless, sailless wreck. Sometimes he would swear at  nothing and fling out his arms wildly, and then with a look of shame  hang down his head and mutter, “No, no, Israel; no, no, no!”    Other prisoners arrived from Tetuan, and all told the same story. Israel  listened to them with a stupid look, seeming hardly to hear the tale  they told him. But one morning, as life began again for the day in that  slimy eddy of life's ocean, every one became aware that an awful change  had come to pass. Israel's face had been worn and tired before, but now  it looked very old and faded. His black hair had been sprinkled with  grey, and now it was white; and white also was his dark beard, which  had grown long and ragged. But his eye glistened, and his teeth were  aglitter in his open mouth. He was laughing at everything, yet not  wildly, not recklessly, not without meaning or intention, but with the  cheer of a happy and contented man.    Israel was mad, and his madness was a moving thing to look upon. He  thought he was back at home and a rich man still, as he had been in  earlier days, but a generous man also, as he was in later ones. With  liberal hand he was dispensing his charities.    “Take what you need; eat, drink, do not stint; there is more where this  has come from; it is not mine; God has lent it me for the good of all.”    With such words, graciously spoken, he served out the provisions  according to his habit, and only departed from his daily custom in  piling the measures higher, and in saluting the people by titles--Sid,  Sidi, Mulai, and the like--in degree as their clothes were poor and  ragged. It was a mad heart that spoke so, but also it was a big one.    From that time forward he looked upon the prisoners as his guests, and  when fresh prisoners came to the prison he always welcomed them as if  he were host there and they were friends who visited him. “Welcome!” he  would say; “you are very welcome. The place is your own. Take all. What  you don't see, believe we have not got it. A thousand thousand welcomes  home!” It was grim and painful irony.    Israel's comrades began to lose sense of their own suffering in  observing the depth of his, and they laid their heads together to  discover the cause of his madness. The most part of them concluded  that he was repining for the loss of his former state. And when one  day another prisoner came from Tetuan with further tales of the Basha's  tyranny, and of the people's shame at thought of how they had dealt by  Israel, the prisoners led the man back to where Israel was standing in  the accustomed act of dispensing bounty, that he might tell his story  into the rightful ears.    “They're always crying for you,” said the Tetawani; “'Israel ben Oliel!  Israel ben Oliel!' that's what you hear in the mosques and the streets  everywhere.' Shame on us for casting him out, shame on us! He was our  father!' Jews and Muslimeen, they're all saying so.”    It was useless. The glad tidings could not find their way. That black  page of Israel's life which told of the people's ingratitude was sealed  in the book of memory. Israel laughed. What could his good friend mean?  Behold! was he not rich? Had he not troops of comrades and guests about  him?    The prisoners turned aside, baffled and done. At length one man--it was  no other than 'Larby the wastrel--drew some of them apart and said, “You  are all wrong. It's not his former state that he's thinking of. _I_ know  what it is--who knows so well as I? Listen! you hear his laughter! Well,  he must weep, or he will be mad for ever. He must be _made_ to weep.  Yes, by Allah! and I must do it.”    That same night, when darkness fell over the dark place, and the  prisoners tied up their cotton headkerchiefs and lay down to sleep,  'Larby sat beside Israel's place with sighs and moans and other symptoms  of a dejected air.    “Sidi, master,” he faltered, “I had a little brother once, and he was  blind. Born blind, Sidi, my own mother's son. But you wouldn't think how  happy he was for all that? You see, Sidi he never missed anything, and  so his little face was like laughing water! By Allah! I loved that boy  better than all the world! Women? Why--well, never mind! He was six and  I was eighteen, and he used to ride on my back! Black curls all over,  Sidi, and big white eyes that looked at you for all they couldn't see.  Well a bleeder came from Soos--curse his great-grandfather! Looked at  little Hosain--'Scales!' said he--burn his father! Bleed him and he'll  see! So they bled him, and he did see. By Allah! yes, for a minute--half  a minute! 'Oh, 'Larby,' he cried--I was holding him; then he--he--'  'Larby,' he cried faint, like a lamb that's lost in the mountains--and  then--and then--'Oh, oh, 'Larby,' he moaned Sidi, Sidi, I _paid_ that  bleeder--there and then--_this_ way! That's why I'm here!”    It was a lie, but 'Larby acted it so well that his voice broke in his  throat, and great drops fell from his eyes on to Israel's hand.    The effect on Israel himself was strange and even startling. While  'Larby was speaking, he was beating his forehead and mumbling: “Where?  When? Naomi!” as if grappling for lost treasures in an ebbing sea.  And when 'Larby finished, he fell on him with reproaches. “And you are  weeping for that?” he cried. “You think it much that the sweet child is  dead--God rest him! So it is to the like of you, but look at me!”    His voice betrayed a grim pride in his miseries. “Look at me! Am  I weeping? No; I would scorn to weep. But I have more cause a  thousandfold. Listen! Once I was rich; but what were riches without  children? Hard bread with no water for sop. I asked God for a child. He  gave me a daughter; but she was born blind and dumb and deaf. I asked  God to take my riches and give her hearing. He gave her hearing; but  what was hearing without speech? I asked God to take all I had and give  her speech. He gave her speech, but what was speech without sight?  I asked God to take my place from me and give her sight. He gave her  sight, and I was cast out of the town like a beggar. What matter? She  had all, and I was forgiven. But when I was happy, when I was content,  when she filled my heart with sunshine, God snatched me away from her.  And where is she now? Yonder, alone, friendless, a child new-born into  the world at the mercy of liars and libertines. And where am I? Here,  like a beast in a trap, uttering abortive groans, toothless, stupid,  powerless, mad. No, no, not mad, either! Tell me, boy, I am not mad!”    In the breaking waters of his madness he was struggling like a drowning  man. “Yet I do not weep,” he cried in a thick voice. “God has a right to  do as He will. He gave her to me for seventeen years. If she dies she'll  be mine again soon. Only if she lives--only if she falls into evil  hands--Tell me, _have_ I been mad?”    He gave no time for an answer. “Naomi!” he cried, and the name broke  in his throat. “Where are you now? What has--who have--your father  is thinking of you--he is--No, I will not weep. You see I have a good  cause, but I tell you I will never weep. God has a right--Naomi!--Na--”    The name thickened to a sob as he repeated it, and then suddenly he rose  and cried in an awful voice, “Oh, I'm a fool! God has done nothing for  me. Why should I do anything for God? He has taken all I had. He has  taken my child. I have nothing more to give Him but my life. Let Him  take that too. Take it, I beseech Thee!” he cried--the vault of the  prison rang--“Take it, and set me free!”    But at the next moment he had fallen back to his place, and was sobbing  like a little child. The other prisoners had risen in their amazement,  and 'Larby, who was shedding hot tears over his cold ones, was capering  down the floor, and singing, “El Arby was a black man.”    Then there was a rattling of keys, and suddenly a flood of light shot  into the dark place. The Kaid el habs was bringing a courier, who  carried an order for Israel's release. Abd er-Rahman, the Sultan, was to  keep the feast of the Moolood at Tetuan, and Ben Aboo, to celebrate the  visit, had pardoned Israel.    It was coals of fire on Israel's head. “God is good,” he muttered. “I  shall see her again. Yes, God has a right to do as He will. I shall see  her soon. God is wise beyond all wisdom. I must lose no time. Jailer  can I leave the town to-night? I wish to start on my journey.  To-night?--yes, to-night! Are the gates open? No? You will open them?  You are very good. Everybody is very good. God is good. God is mighty.”    Then half in shame, and partly as apology for his late intemperate  outburst, with a simpleness that was almost childish, he said, “A man's  a fool when he loses his only child. I don't mean by death. Time heals  that. But the living child--oh, it's an unending pain! You would never  think how happy we were. Her pretty ways were all my joy. Yes, for her  voice was music, and her breath was like the dawn. Do you know, I was  very fond of the little one--I was quite miserable if I lost sight  of her for an hour. And then to be wrenched away! . . . . But I must  hasten back. The little one will be waiting. Yes, I know quite well  she'll be looking out from the door in the sunshine when she awakes in  the morning. It's always the way of these tender creatures, is it not?  So we must humour them. Yes, yes, that's so that's so.”    His fellow-prisoners stood around him each in his night-headkerchief  knotted under his chin--gaunt, hooded figures, in the shifting light of  the jailer's lantern.    “Farewell, brothers!” he cried; and one by one they touched his hand and  brought it to their breasts.    “Farewell, master!” “Peace, Sidi!” “Farewell!” “Peace!” “Farewell!”    The light shot out; the door clasped back; there were footsteps  dying away outside; two loud bangs as of a closing gate, and then  silence--empty and ghostly.    In the darkness the hooded figures stood a moment listening, and then a  croaking, breaking, husky, merry voice began to sing--         El Arby was a black man,       They called him “'Larby Kosk;”        He loved the wives of the Kasbah,       And stole slippers in the Mosque.        CHAPTER XXII    HOW NAOMI TURNED MUSLIMA      What had happened to Naomi during the two months and a half while Israel  lay at Shawan is this: After the first agony of their parting, in which  she was driven back by the soldiers when she attempted to follow them,  she sat down in a maze of pain, without any true perception of the evil  which had befallen her, but with her father's warning voice and his last  words in her ear: “Stay here. Never leave this place. Whatever they say,  stay here. I will come back.”    When she awoke in the morning, after a short night of broken sleep and  fitful dreams, the voice and the words were with her still, and then she  knew for the first time what the meaning was, and what the penalty, of  this strange and dread asundering. She was alone, and, being alone, she  was helpless; she was no better than a child, without kindred to look  to her and without power to look to herself, with food and drink beside  her, but no skill to make and take them.    Thus her awakening sense was like that of a lamb whose mother has been  swallowed up in the night by the sand-drifts of the simoom. It was  not so much love as loss. What to do, where to look, which way to turn  first, she knew no longer, and could not think, for lack of the hand  that had been wont to guide her.    The neighbouring Moors heard of what had happened to Naomi, and some  of the women among them came to see her. They were poor farming people,  oppressed by cruel taxmasters; and the first things they saw were  the cattle and sheep, and the next thing was the simple girl with the  child-face, who knew nothing yet of the ways wherein a lonely woman must  fend for herself.    “You cannot live here alone, my daughter,” they said; “you would perish.  Then think of the danger--a child like you, with a face like a flower!  No, no, you must come to us. We will look to you like one of our own,  and protect you from evil men. And as for the creatures--”    “But he said I was never to leave this place,” said Naomi. “'Stay here,'  he said; 'whatever they say, stay here. I will come back.'”    The women protested that she would starve, be stolen, ruined, and  murdered. It was in vain. Naomi's answer was always the same: “He told  me to stay here, and surely I must do so.”    Then one after another the poor folks went away in anger. “Tut!” they  thought, “what should we want with the Jew child? Allah! Was there ever  such a simpleton? The good creatures going to waste, too! And as for her  father, he'll never come back--never. Trust the Basha for that!”    But when the humanity of the true souls had conquered their selfishness,  they came again one by one and vied with each other in many simple  offices--milking and churning, and baking and delving--in pity of the  sweet girl with the great eyes who had been left to live alone. And  Naomi, seeing her helplessness at last, put out all her powers to remedy  it, so that in a little while she was able to do for herself nearly  everything that her neighbours at first did for her. Then they would say  among themselves, “Allah! she's not such a baby after all; and if  she wasn't quite so beautiful, poor child, or if the world wasn't so  wicked--but then, God is great! God is great!”    Not at first had Naomi understood them when they told her that her  father had been cast into prison, and every night when she left her lamp  alight by the little skin-covered window that was half-hidden under  the dropping eaves, and every morning when she opened her door to the  radiance of the sun she had whispered to herself and said, “He will come  back, Naomi; only wait, only wait; maybe it will be tonight, maybe it  will be to-day; you will see, you will see.”    But after the awful thought of what prison was had fully dawned upon  her as last, by help of what she saw and heard of other men who had been  there, her old content in her father's command that she should never  leave that place was shaken and broken by a desire to go to him.    “Who's to feed him, poor soul? He will be famishing. If the Kaid finds  him in bread, it will only be so much more added to his ransom. That  will come to the same thing in the end, or he'll die in prison.”    Thus she had heard the gossips talk among themselves when they thought  she did not listen. And though it was little she understood of Kaids and  ransoms, she was quick to see the nature of her father's peril, and at  length she concluded that, in spite of his injunction, go to him she  should and must. With that resolve, her mind, which had been the mind  of a child seemed to spring up instantly and become the mind of a woman,  and her heart, that had been timid, suddenly grew brave, for pity and  love were born in it. “He must be starving in prison,” she thought, “and  I will take him food.”    When her neighbours heard of her intention they lifted their hands in  consternation and horror. “God be gracious to my father!” they cried.  “Shawan? You? Alone? Child, you'll be lost, lost--worse, a thousand  times worse! Shoof! you're only a baby still.”    But their protests availed as little to keep Naomi at her home now as  their importunities had done before to induce her to leave it. “He must  be starving in prison,” she said, “and I will take him food.”    Her neighbours left her to her stubborn purpose.    “Allah!” they said, “who would have believed it, that the little  pink-and-white face had such a will of her own!”    Without more ado Naomi set herself to prepare for her journey. She  saved up thirty eggs, and baked as many of the round flat cakes of the  country; also she churned some butter in the simple way which the women  had taught her, and put the milk that was left in a goat's-skin. In  three days she was ready, and then she packed her provisions in the leaf  panniers of a mule which one of the neighbours had lent to her, and got  up before them on the front of the burda, after the manner of the wives  whom she had seen going past to market.    When she was about to start her gossips came again, in pity of her wild  errand, to bid her farewell and to see the last of her. “Keep to the  track as far as Tetuan,” they said to her, “and then ask for the road  to Shawan.” One old creature threw a blanket over her head in such a  way that it might cover her face. “Faces like yours are not for the  daylight,” the old body whispered, and then Naomi set forward on her  journey. The women watched her while she mounted the hill that goes up  to the fondak, and then sinks out of sight beyond it. “Poor mad little  fool,” they whimpered; “that's the end of her! She'll never come back.  Too many men about for that. And now,” they said, facing each other with  looks of suspicion and envy, “what of the creatures?”    While the good souls were dividing her possessions among them, Naomi was  awakening to some vague sense of her difficulties and dangers. She had  thought it would be easy to ask her way, but now that she had need to do  so she was afraid to speak. The sight of a strange face alarmed her,  and she was terrified when she met a company of wandering Arabs changing  pasture, with the young women and children on camels, the old women  trudging on foot under loads of cans and kettles, the boys driving the  herds, and the men, armed with long flintlocks, riding their prancing  barbs. Her poor little mule came to a stand in the midst of this  cavalcade, and she was too bewildered to urge it on. Also her fear  which had first caused her to cover her face with the blanket that her  neighbour had given her, now made her forget to do so, and the men as  they passed her peered close into her eyes. Such glances made her blood  to tingle. They seared her very soul, and she began to know the meaning  of shame.    Nevertheless, she tried to keep up a brave heart and to push forward.  “He is starving in prison,” she told herself; “I must lose no time.” It  was a weary journey. Everything was new to her, and nearly everything  was terrible. She was even perplexed to see that however far she  travelled she came upon men and women and children. It was so strange  that all the world was peopled. Yet sometimes she wished there were more  people everywhere. That was when she was crossing a barren waste with no  house in sight and never a sign of human life on any side. But oftener  she wished that the people were not so many; and that was when the  children mocked at her mule, or the women jeered at her as if she must  needs be a base person because she was alone, or the men laughed and  leered into her uncovered face.    Before she had gone many miles her heart began to fail. Everything was  unlike what she expected. She had thought the world so good that she had  but to say to any that asked her of her errand, “My father is in prison,  they say that he is starving; I am taking him food,” and every one would  help her forward. Though she had never put it to herself so, yet she had  reckoned in this way in spite of the warnings of her neighbours. But no  one was helping her forward; few were looking on her with goodwill, and  fewer still with pity and cheer.    The jogging of the mule, a most bony and stiff-limbed beast, had  flattened the panniers that hung by its side, and made the round cakes  of bread to protrude from the open mouth of one of them. Seeing this,  a line of market-women going by, with bags of charcoal on their backs,  snatched a cake each as they passed and munched them and laughed. Naomi  tried to protest. “The bread is for my father,” she faltered; “he is  in prison; they say he--” But the expostulation that began thus timidly  broke down of itself, for the women laughed again out of their mouths  choked with the bread, and in another moment they were gone.    Naomi's spirit was crushed, but she tried to keep up a brave front  still. To speak of her father again would be to shame him. The poor  little illusions of the sweetness and goodness of the world which, in  spite of vague recollections of Tetuan, she had struggled, since the  coming of her sight, to build up in her fresh young soul, were now  tumbling to pieces. After all, the world was very cruel. It was the same  as if an angel out of the clouds had fallen on to the earth and found  her feet mired with clay.    Six hours after she had set out from her home Naomi came to a  fondak which stood in those days outside the walls of Tetuan on the  south-western side. The darkness had closed in by this time, and she  must needs rest there for the night, but never until then had she  reflected that for such accommodation she would need money. Only a few  coppers were necessary, only twenty moozoonahs, that she might lie in  the shelter and safety of one of the pens that were built for the sleep  of human creatures, and that her mule might be tethered and fed on  the manure heap that constituted the square space within. At last she  bethought her of her eggs, and, though it went to her heart to use for  herself what was meant for her father, she parted with twelve of them,  and some cakes of the bread besides, that she might be allowed to pass  the gate, telling herself repeatedly, with big throbs of remorse between  her protestations, that unless she did so her father might never get  anything at all.    The fondak was a miserable place, full of farming people who were to go  on to market at Tetuan in the morning, of many animals of burden, and  of countless dogs. It was the eve of the month of Rabya el-ooal, and  between the twilight and the coming of night certain of the men watched  for the new moon, and when its thin bow appeared in the sky they  signalled its advent after their usual manner by firing their flintlocks  into the air, while their women, who were squatting around, kept up a  cooing chorus. Then came eating and drinking, and laughing and singing,  and playing the ginbri, and feats of juggling, as well as snarling and  quarrelling and fighting, and also peacemaking by means of a cudgel  wielded by the keeper of the fondak. With such exercises the night  passed into morning.    Naomi was sick. Her head ached. The smell of rotten fish, the stench of  the manure heap, the braying of the donkeys, the barking of the dogs,  the grunt of the camels, and the tumult of human voices made her  light-headed. She could neither eat nor sleep. Almost as soon as it  was light she was up and out and on her way. “I must lose no time,” she  thought, trying not to realise that the blue sky was spinning round her,  that noises were ringing in her head, and that her poor little heart,  which had been so stout only yesterday, was sinking very low.    “He must be starving,” she told herself again, and that helped her to  forget her own troubles and to struggle on. But oh, if the world were  only not so cruel, oh, if there were anyone to give her a word of cheer,  nay, a glance of pity! But nobody had looked at her except the women who  stole her bread and the men who shamed her with their wicked eyes.    That one day's experience did more than all her life before it to fill  her with the bitter fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and  evil. Her illusions fell away from her, and her sweet childish faith was  broken down. She saw herself as she was: a simple girl, a child ignorant  of the ways of the world, going alone on a long journey unknown to her,  thinking to succour her father in prison, and carrying a handful of eggs  and a few poor cakes of bread. When at length the scales fell from the  eyes of her mind, and as she trudged along on her bony mule, afraid to  ask her way, she saw herself, with all her fine purposes shrivelled up,  do what she would to be brave, she could not help but cry. It was all  so vain, so foolish; she was such a weak little thing. Her father knew  this, and that was why he told her to stay where he left her. What if he  came home while she was absent! Should she go back?    She had almost resolved to return, struggle as she might to push  forward, when going close under the town walls, near to the very gate,  the Bab Toot whereat she had been cast out with her father remembering  this scene of their abasement with a new sense of its cruelty and shame  born of her own simple troubles, she lit upon a woman who was coming  out.    It was Habeebah. She was now the slave of Ben Aboo, and was just then  stealing away from the Kasbah in the early morning that she might go in  search of Naomi, whose whereabouts and condition she had lately learned.    The two might have passed unknown, for Habeebah was veiled, but that  Naomi had forgotten her blanket and was uncovered. In another moment the  poor frightened girl, with all her brave bearing gone, was weeping on  the black woman's breast.    “Whither are you going?” said Habeebah.    “To my father,” Naomi began. “He is in prison; they say he is starving;  I was taking food to him, but I am lost, I don't know my way; and  besides--”    “The very thing!” cried Habeebah.    Habeebah had her own little scheme. It was meant to win emancipation at  the hands of her master, and paradise for her soul when she died. Naomi,  who was a Jewess, was to turn Muslima. That was all. Then her troubles  would end, and wondrous fortune would descend upon her, and her father  who was in prison would be set free.    Now, religion was nothing to Naomi; she hardly understood what it meant.  The differences of faith were less than nothing, but her father was  everything, and so she clutched at Habeebah's bold promises like a  drowning soul at the froth of a breaker.    “My father will be let out of prison? You are sure--quite sure?” she  asked.    “Quite sure,” answered Habeebah stoutly.    Naomi's hopes of ever reaching her father were now faint, and her  poor little stock of eggs and bread looked like folly to her new-born  worldliness.    “Very well,” she said. “I will turn Muslima.”    A few minutes afterwards she was riding by Habeebah's side into the  town, through the Bab Toot across the Feddan, and up to the courtyard  of the Kasbah, which had witnessed the beginning of her own and her  father's degradation. Then, tethering the beast in the open stables  there, Habeebah took Naomi into her own little room and left her alone  for some minutes, while she hastened to Ben Aboo in secret with her  wondrous news.    “Lord Basha,” she said, “the beautiful Jewess Naomi, the daughter of  Israel ben Oliel, will turn Muslima.”    “Where is she?” said Ben Aboo.    “Sidi,” said Habeebah, “I have promised that you will liberate her  father.”    “Fetch her,” said Ben Aboo, “and it shall be done.”    But meanwhile Fatimah had gone to Habeebah's room and found Naomi there,  and heard of the vain hope which had brought her.    “My sweet jewel of gold and silver,” the black woman cried, “you don't  know what you are doing. Turn Muslima, and you will be parted from your  father for ever. He is a Jew, and will have no right to you any more.  You will never, never see him again. He will be lost to you--lost--I  say--lost!”    Habeebah, with two of the guard, came back to take Naomi to Ben Aboo.  The poor girl was bewildered. She had seen nothing but her father  in Fatimah's protest, just as she had seen nothing but her father in  Habeebah's promises. She did not know what to do, she was such a poor  weak little thing, and there was no strong hand to guide her.    They led her through dark passages to an open place which she thought  she had seen before. It was a great patio, paved and walled with tiles.  Men were standing together there in red peaked caps and flowing white  kaftans. And before them all was one old man in garments that were of  the colour of the afternoon sun, with sleeves like the mouths of bells,  a silver knife at his waistband, and little leather bags, hung by yellow  cords, about his neck. Beside this man there was a woman of a laughing  cruel face, and she herself, Naomi, stood in the midst, with every eye  upon her. Where had she seen all this before?    Ben Aboo had often bethought him of the beautiful girl since he  committed her father to prison. He cherished schemes concerning her  which he did not share with his wife Katrina. But he had hitherto been  withheld by two considerations: the first being that he was beset with  difficulties arising out of the demands of the Sultan for more money  than he could find, and the next that he foresaw the necessity that  might perchance arise of recalling Israel to his post. Out of these  grave bedevilments he had extricated himself at length by imposing  dues on certain tribes of Reefians, who had never yet acknowledged the  Sultan's authority, and by calling on the Sultan's army to enforce them.  The Sultan had come in answer to his summons, the Reefians had been  routed, their villages burnt, and that morning at daybreak he had  received a message saying that Abd er-Rahman intended to keep the feast  of the Moolood at Tetuan. So this capture of Naomi was the luckiest  chance that could have befallen him at such a moment. She should witness  to the Prophet; her father, the Jew, would thereby lose his rights  in her; and he himself, as her sole guardian, would present her as a  peace-offering to the Sultan on crossing the boundary of his bashalic.    Such was the new plan which Ben Aboo straightway conceived at hearing  the news of Habeebah, and in another moment he had propounded it to  Katrina. But when Naomi came into the patio, looking so soft, so timid,  so tired, yet so beautiful, so unlike his own painted beauties, with the  light of the dawn on her open face, with her clear eyes and the sweet  mouth of a child, his evil passions had all they could do not to go back  to his former scheme.    “So you wish to turn Muslima?” he said.    Naomi gave one dazed look around, and then cried in a voice of fear “No,  no, no!”    Ben Aboo glanced at Habeebah, and Habeebah fell upon Naomi with  protests and remonstrances. “She said so,” Habeebah cried. “'I will turn  Muslima,' she said. Yes, Sidi, she said so, I swear it!”    “Did you say so?” asked Ben Aboo.    “Yes,” said Naomi faintly.    “Then, by Allah, there can be no going back now,” said Ben Aboo; and he  told her what was the penalty of apostasy. It was death. She must choose  between them.    Naomi began to cry, and Ben Aboo to laugh at her and Habeebah to plead  with her. Still she saw one thing only. “But what of my father?” she  said.    “He shall be liberated,” said Ben Aboo.    “But shall I see him again? Shall I go back to him?” said Naomi.    “The girl is a simpleton!” said Katrina.    “She is only a child,” said Ben Aboo, and with one glance more at her  flower-like face, he committed her for three days to the apartments of  his women.    These apartments consisted of a garden overgrown by straggling weeds,  with a fountain of muddy water in the middle, an oblong room that was  stifling from many perfumes, and certain smaller chambers. The garden  was inhabited by a gazelle, whose great startled eyes looked out through  the long grass; and the oblong room by a number of women of varying  ages, among whom were a matronly Mooress, called Tarha, in a scarlet  head-dress, and with a string of great keys swung from shoulder to  waist; a Circassian, called Hoolia, in a gorgeous rida of red silk and  gold brocade; a Frenchwoman, called Josephine, with embroidered red  slippers and black stockings; and a Jewess, called Sol, with a band of  silk handkerchiefs tied round her forehead above her coal-black curls,  with her fingers pricked out with henna and her eyes darkened with kohl.    Such were Ben Aboo's wives and concubines and captives, whom he had not  divorced according to his promise; and when Naomi came among them they  did their duty by their master faithfully. Being trapped themselves,  they tried to entrap Naomi also. They overwhelmed her with caresses,  they went into ecstasies over her beauty, and caused the future which  awaited her to shine before her eyes. She would have a noble husband,  magnificent dresses, a brilliant palace, and the world would be at her  feet. “And what's the difference between Moosa and Mohammed?” said Sol;  “look at me!” “Tut!” said Josephine, “there's nothing to choose between  them.” “For my part,” said Tarha, “I don't see what it matters to us;  they say Paradise is for the men!” “And think of the jewels, and the  earrings as big as a bracelet,” said Hoolia, “instead of this,” and she  drew away between her thumb and first finger the blanket which Naomi's  neighbour had given her.    It was all to no purpose. “But what of my father?” Naomi asked again and  again.    The women lost patience at her simplicity, gave up their solicitations,  ignored her, and busied themselves with their own affairs. “Tut!” they  said, “why should we want her to be made a wife of the Sultan? She would  only walk over us like dirt whenever she came to Tetuan.”    Then, sitting alone in their midst, listening to their talk, their  tales, their jests, and their laughter, the unseen mantle fell upon  Naomi at last, which made her a woman who had hitherto been a child.  In this hothouse of sickly odours these women lived together, having no  occupation but that of eating and drinking and sleeping, no education  but devising new means of pleasing the lust of their husband's eye, no  delight than that of supplanting one another in his love, no passion but  jealousy, no diversion but sporting on the roofs, no end but death and  the Kabar.    Seeing the uselessness of the siege, Ben Aboo transferred Naomi to the  prison, and set Habeebah to guard her. The black woman was in terror at  the turn that events had taken. There was nothing to do now but to  go on, so she importuned Naomi with prayers. How could she be so  hard-hearted? Could she keep her father famishing in prison when one  word out of her lips would liberate him? Naomi had no answer but her  tears. She remembered the hareem, and cried.    Then Ben Aboo thought of a daring plan. He called the Grand Rabbi, and  commanded him to go to Naomi and convert her to Islam. The Rabbi  obeyed with trembling. After all, it was the same God that both peoples  worshipped, only the Moors called Him Allah and the Jews Jehovah. Naomi  knew little of either. It was not of God that she was thinking: it was  only of her father. She was too innocent to see the trick, but the Rabbi  failed. He kissed her, and went away wiping his eyes.    Rumour of Naomi's plight had passed through the town, and one night a  number of Moors came secretly to a lane at the back of the Kasbah, where  a narrow window opened into her cell. They told her in whispers that  what she held as tragical was a very simple matter. “Turn Muslima,” they  pleaded, “and save yourself. You are too young to die. Resign yourself,  for God's sake.” But no answer came back to them where they were  gathered in the darkness, save low sobs from inside the wall.    At last Ben Aboo made two announcements. The first, a public one, was  that Abd er-Rahman would reach Tetuan within two days, on the opening  of the feast of the Moolood, and the other, a private one, that if  Naomi had not said the Kelmah by first prayers the following morning she  should die and her father be cut off as the penalty of her apostasy.    That night the place under the narrow window in the dark lane was  occupied by a group of Jews. “Sister,” they whispered, “sister of our  people, listen. The Basha is a hard man. This day he has robbed us of  all we had that he may pay for the Sultan's visit. Listen! We have heard  something. We want Israel ben Oliel back among us. He was our father,  he was our brother. Save his life for the sake of our children, for the  Basha has taken their bread. Save him, sister, we beg, we entreat, we  pray.”    Naomi broke down at last. Next morning at dawn, kneeling among men in  the Grand Mosque in the Metamar, she repeated the Word after the Iman:  “I testify that there is no God but God, and that our Lord Mohammed is  the messenger of God; I am truly resigned.”    Then she was taken back to the women's apartments, and clad gorgeously.  Her child face was wet with tears. She was only a poor weak little  thing, she knew nothing of religion, she loved her father better than  God, and all the world was against her.        CHAPTER XXIII    ISRAEL'S RETURN FROM PRISON      Such was the method of Israel's release. But, knowing nothing of the  price which had been paid for it, he was filled with an immense joy.  Nay, his happiness was quite childish, so suddenly had the darkness  which hung over his life been lifted away. Any one who had seen him in  prison would have been puzzled by the change as he came away from it.  He laughed with the courier who walked with him to the town gate, and  jested with the gate porter as with an old acquaintance. His voice was  merry, his eye gleamed in the rays of the lantern, his face was flushed,  and his step was light. “Afraid to travel in the night? No, no, I'll  meet nothing worse than myself. Others _may_ who meet me? Ha, ha!  Perhaps so, perhaps so!” “No evil with you, brother?” “No evil, praise  be God.” “Well, peace be to you!” “On you be peace!” “May your morning  be blessed! Good-night!” “Good-night!” Then with a wave of the hand he  was gone into the darkness.    It was a wonderful night. The moon, which was in its first quarter,  was still low in the east, but the stars were thick overhead, making a  silvery dome that almost obliterated the blue. Rivers were rumbling on  the hillside, an owl was hooting in the distance, kine that could not be  seen were chewing audibly near at hand, and sheep like patches of white  in the gloom were scuttling through the grass before Israel's footsteps.  Israel walked quickly, tracing his course between the two arms of the  Jebel Sheshawan, whose summits were visible against the sky. The air was  cool and moist, and a gentle breeze was blowing from the sea. Oh! the  joy of it to him who had lain long months in prison! Israel drank in the  night air as a young colt drinks in the wind.    And if it was night in the world without, it was day in Israel's heart.  “I am going to be happy,” he told himself, “yes, very happy, very  happy.” He raised his eyes to heaven, and a star, bigger and brighter  than the rest, hung over the path before him. “It is leading me to  Naomi,” he thought. He knew that was folly, but he could not restrain  his mind from foolishness. And at least she had the same moon and stars  above her sleep, for she would be sleeping now. “I am coming,” he cried.  He fixed his eye on the bright star in front and pushed forward, never  resting, never pausing.    The morning dawned. Long rippling waves of morning air came down the  mountains, cool, chill, and moist. The grey light became tinged with  red. Then the sun rose somewhere. It had not yet appeared, but the peak  of the western hill was flushed and a raven flew out and perched on the  point of light. Israel's breast expanded, and he strode on with a firmer  step. “She will be waking soon,” he told himself.    The world awoke. From unseen places birds began to sing--the wheatear  in the crevices of the rocks, the sedge-warbler among the rushes of the  rivers. The sun strode up over the hill summit, and then all the earth  below was bright. Dewdrops sparkled on the late flowers, and lay like  vast spiders' webs over the grass; sheep began to bleat, dogs to bark,  kine to low, horses to cross each other's necks, and over the freshness  of the air came the smell of peat and of green boughs burning. Israel  did not stop, but pushed on with new eagerness. “She will have risen  now,” he told himself. He could almost fancy he saw her opening the door  and looking out for him in the sunlight.    “Poor little thing,” he thought, “how she misses me! But I am coming, I  am coming!”    The country looked very beautiful, and strangely changed since he saw  it last. Then it had been like a dead man's face; now it was like a face  that was always smiling. And though the year was so old it seemed to  be quite young. No tired look of autumn, no warning of winter; only the  freshness and vigour of spring. “I am going to see my child, and I shall  be happy yet,” thought Israel. The dust of life seemed to hang on him no  longer.    He came to a little village called Dar el Fakeer--“the house of the poor  one.” The place did not even justify its name, for it was a cinereous  wreck. Not a living creature was to be seen anywhere. The village had  been sacked by the Sultan's army, and its inhabitants had fled to the  mountains. Israel paused a moment, and looked into one of the ruined  houses. He knew it must have been the house of a Jew, for he could  recognise it by its smell. The floor was strewn over with rubbish--cans,  kettles, water-bottles, a woman's handkerchief, and a dainty red  slipper. On the ragged grass in the court within there were some little  stones built up into tiny squares, and bits of stick stuck into the  ground in lines. A young girl had lived in that house; children had  played there; the gaunt and silent place breathed of their spirits  still. “Poor souls!” thought Israel, but the troubles of others could  not really touch him. At that very moment his heart was joyful.    The day was warm, but not too hot for walking. Israel did not feel  weary, and so he went on without resting. He reckoned how far it was  from Shawan to his home near Semsa. It was nearly seventy miles. That  distance would take two days and two nights to cover on foot. He had  left the prison on Wednesday night, and it would be Friday at sunset  before he reached Naomi. It was now Thursday morning. He must lose  no time. “You see, the poor little thing will be waiting, waiting,  waiting,” he told himself. “These sweet creatures are all so impatient;  yes, yes, so foolishly impatient. God bless them!”    He met people on the road, and hailed them with good cheer. They  answered his greetings sadly, and a few of them told him of their  trouble. Something they said of Ben Aboo, that he demanded a hundred  dollars which they could not pay, and something of the Sultan, that he  had ransacked their houses and then gone on with his great army, his  twenty wives, and fifteen tents to keep the feast at Tetuan. But Israel  hardly knew what they told him, though he tried to lend an ear to their  story. He was thinking out a wonderful scheme for the future. With Naomi  he was to leave Morocco. They were to sail for England. Free, mighty,  noble, beautiful England! Ah, how it shone in his memory, the little  white island of the sea! His mother's home! England! Yes, he would go  back to it. True, he had no friends there now; but what matter of that?  Ah, yes, he was old, and the roll-call of his kindred showed him pitiful  gaps. His mother! Ruth! But he had Naomi still. Naomi! He spoke her name  aloud, softly, tenderly, caressingly, as if his wrinkled hand were on  her hair. Then recovering himself, he laughed to think that he could be  so childish.    Near to sunset he came upon a dooar, a tent village, in a waste place.  It was pitched in a wide circle, and opened inwards. The animals were  picketed in the centre, where children and dogs were playing, and the  voices of men and women came from inside the tents. Fires were burning  under kettles swung from triangles, and sight of this reminded Israel  that he had not eaten since the previous day. “I must have food,” he  thought, “though I do not feel hungry.” So he stopped, and the wandering  Arabs hailed him. “Markababikum!” they cried from where they sat within.    “You are very welcome! Welcome to our lofty land!” Their land was the  world.    Israel went into one of the tents, and sat down to a dish of boiled  beans and black bread. It was very sweet. A man was eating beside him; a  woman, half dressed, and with face uncovered, was suckling a child while  she worked a loom which was fastened to the tent's two upright poles.  Some fowls were nestling for the night under the tent wing, and a young  girl was by turns churning milk by tossing it in a goat's-skin and  baking cakes on a fire of dried thistles crackling in a hole over three  stones. All were laughing together, and Israel laughed along with them.    “On a long journey, brother?” said the man.    “No, oh no, no,” said Israel. “Only to Semsa, no farther.”    “Well, you must sleep here to-night,” said the Arab.    “Ah, I cannot do that,” said Israel.    “No?”    “You see, I am going back to my little daughter. She is alone, poor  child, and has not seen her old father for months. Really it is wrong of  a man to stay away such a time. These tender creatures are so impatient,  you know. And then they imagine such things, do they not? Well, I  suppose we must humour them--that's what I always say.”    “But look, the night is coming, and a dark one, too!” said the woman.    “Oh, nothing, that's nothing, sister,” said Israel. “Well, peace!  Farewell all, farewell!”    Waving his hand he went away laughing, but before he had gone far the  darkness overtook him. It came down from the mountains like a dense  black cloud. Not a star in the sky, not a gleam on the land, darkness  ahead of him, darkness behind, one thick pall hanging in the air on  every side. Still for a while he toiled along. Every step was an effort.  The ground seemed to sink under him. It was like walking on mattresses.  He began to feel tired and nervous and spiritless. A cold sweat broke  out on his brow, and at length, when the sound of a river came from  somewhere near, though on which side of him he could not tell, he had no  choice but to stop. “After all, it is better,” he thought. “Strange, how  things happen for the best! I must sleep to-night, for to-morrow night I  will get no sleep at all. No, for I shall have so many things to say and  to ask and to hear.”    Consoling him thus, he tried to sleep where he was, and as slumber crept  upon him in the darkness, with five-and-twenty heavy miles of dense  night between him and his home, he crooned and talked to himself in  a childish way that he might comfort his aching heart. “Yes, I must  sleep--sleep--to-morrow _she_ must sleep and I must watch by her--watch  by her as I used to do--used to do--how soft and beautiful--how  beautiful--sleeping--sleep--Ah!”    When he awoke the sun had risen. The sea lay before him in the distance,  the blue Mediterranean stretching out to the blue sky. He was on the  borders of the country of the Beni-Hassan, and, after wading the river,  which he had heard in the night, he began again on his journey. It was  now Friday morning, and by sunset of that day he would be back at his  home near Semsa. Already he could see Tetuan far away, girt by its white  walls, and perched on the hillside. Yonder it lay in the sunlight, with  the snow-tipped heights above it, a white blaze surrounded by orange  orchards.    But how dizzy he was! How the world went round! How the earth trembled!  Was the glare of the sun too fierce that morning, or had his eyes grown  dim? Going blind? Well, even so, he would not repine, for Naomi could  see now. She would see for him also. How sweet to see through Naomi's  eyes! Naomi was young and joyous, and bright and blithe. All the world  was new to her, and strange and beautiful. It would be a second and far  sweeter youth.    Naomi--Naomi--always Naomi! He had thought of her hitherto as she had  appeared to him during the few days of their happy lives at Semsa.  But now he began to wonder if time had not changed her since then. Two  months and a half--it seemed so long! He had visions of Naomi grown from  a sweet girl to a lovely woman. A great soul beamed out of her big,  slow eyes. He himself approached her meekly, humbly, reverently.  Nevertheless, he was her father still--her old, tired, dim-eyed father;  and she led him here and there, and described things to him. He could  see and hear it all. First Naomi's voice: “A bow in the sky--red, blue,  crimson--oh!” Then his own deeper one, out of its lightsome darkness: “A  rainbow, child!” Ah! the dreams were beautiful!    He tried to recall the very tones of Naomi's voice--the voice of his  poor dead Ruth--and to remember the song that she used to sing--the song  she sang in the patio on that great night of the moonlight, when he  was returning home from the Bab Ramooz, and heard her singing from the  street--         Within my heart a voice       Bids earth and heaven rejoice.    He sang the song to himself as he toiled along. With a little lisp he  sang it, so that he might cheat himself and think that the voice he was  making was Naomi's voice and not his own.    Towards midday Israel came under the walls of Tetuan, between the  Sultan's gardens and the flour-mills that are turned by the escaping  sewers, and there he lit upon a company of Jews. They were a deputation  that had come out from the town to meet him, and at first sight of his  face they were shocked. He had left Tetuan a stricken man, it was true,  but strong and firm, fifty years of age and resolute. Six months had  passed, and he was coming back as a weak, broken, shattered, doddering,  infirm old man of eighty. Their hearts fell low before they spoke, but  after a pause one of them--Israel knew him: a grey-bearded man, his name  was Solomon Laredo--stepped up and said, “Israel ben Oliel, our poor  Tetuan is in trouble. It needs you. Alas! we dealt ill with you, but God  has punished us, and we are brothers now. Come back to us, we pray of  you; for we have heard of a great thing that is coming to pass. Listen!”    Something they told him then of Mohammed of Mequinez, follower of  Seedna Aissa (Jesus of Nazareth), but a good man nevertheless, and also  something they said of the Spaniards and of one Marshal O'Donnel,  who was to bombard Marteel. But Israel heard very little. “I think my  hearing must be failing me,” he said; and then he laughed lightly, as if  that did not greatly matter. “And to tell you the truth, though I pity  my poor brethren, I can no longer help them. God will raise up a better  minister.”    “Never!” cried the Jews in many voices.    “Anyhow,” said Israel, “my life among you is ended. I set no store by  place and power. What does the English poet say, 'In the great hand of  God I stand.' Shakespeare--oh, a mighty creature--one who knew where  the soul of a man lay. But I forget, you've not lived in England. Do  you know I am to go there again, and to take my little daughter? You  remember her--Naomi--a charming girl. She can see now, and hear, and  speak also! Yes for God has lifted His hand away from her, and I am  going to be very happy. Well, I must leave you, brothers. The little one  will be waiting. I must not keep her too long, must I? Peace, peace!”    Seeing his profound faith, no one dared to tell him the truth that was  on every tongue. A wave of compassion swept over all. The deputation  stood and watched him until he had sunk under the hill.    And now, being come thus near to home, Israel's impatience robbed him  of some of his happy confidence and filled him with fears. He began  to think of all the evil chances that might have befallen Naomi. His  absence had been so long, and so many things might have happened since  he went away. In this mood he tried to run. It was a poor uncertain  shamble. At nearly every step the body lurched for poise and balance.    At last he came to a point of the path from which, as he knew, the  little rush-covered house ought to be seen. “It's yonder,” he cried, and  pointed it out to himself with uplifted finger. The sun was sinking, and  its strong rays were in his face. “She's there, I see her!” he shouted.  A few minutes later he was near the door. “No, my eyes deceived me,”   he said in a damp voice. “Or perhaps she has gone in--perhaps she's  hiding--the sweet rogue!”    The door was half open; he pushed it and entered the house. “Naomi!” he  called in a voice like a caress. “Naomi!” His voice trembled now. “Come  to me, come, dearest; come quickly, quickly, I cannot see!” He listened.  There was not a sound, not a movement. “Naomi!” The name was like a  gurgle in his throat. There was a pause, and then he said very feebly  and simply, “She's not here.”    He looked around, and picked up something from the floor. It was a  slipper covered with mould. As he gazed upon it a change came ",59.16,8.9,12.2,7.5,13.4,5.87,1777,11.0,13.56,13th and 14th grade
4,The Ball at Sceauxr," power of her  coquettish arts. Long familiar with the secret of cajoling the old man,  she lavished on him the most childlike caresses, the tenderest names;  she even went so far as to kiss him to induce him to divulge so  important a secret. The old man, who spent his life in playing off these  scenes on his niece, often paying for them with a present of jewelry,  or by giving her his box at the opera, this time amused himself with  her entreaties, and, above all, her caresses. But as he spun out this  pleasure too long, Emilie grew angry, passed from coaxing to sarcasm and  sulks; then, urged by curiosity, she recovered herself. The diplomatic  admiral extracted a solemn promise from his niece that she would for  the future be gentler, less noisy, and less wilful, that she would spend  less, and, above all, tell him everything. The treaty being concluded,  and signed by a kiss impressed on Emilie’s white brow, he led her into  a corner of the room, drew her on to his knee, held the card under the  thumbs so as to hide it, and then uncovered the letters one by one,  spelling the name of Longueville; but he firmly refused to show her  anything more.    This incident added to the intensity of Mademoiselle de Fontaine’s  secret sentiment, and during chief part of the night she evolved the  most brilliant pictures from the dreams with which she had fed her  hopes. At last, thanks to chance, to which she had so often  appealed, Emilie could now see something very unlike a chimera at the  fountain-head of the imaginary wealth with which she gilded her married  life. Ignorant, as all young girls are, of the perils of love and  marriage, she was passionately captivated by the externals of marriage  and love. Is not this as much as to say that her feeling had birth like  all the feelings of extreme youth--sweet but cruel mistakes, which exert  a fatal influence on the lives of young girls so inexperienced as to  trust their own judgment to take care of their future happiness?    Next morning, before Emilie was awake, her uncle had hastened to  Chevreuse. On recognizing, in the courtyard of an elegant little villa,  the young man he had so determinedly insulted the day before, he went up  to him with the pressing politeness of men of the old court.    “Why, my dear sir, who could have guessed that I should have a brush,  at the age of seventy-three, with the son, or the grandson, of one of my  best friends. I am a vice-admiral, monsieur; is not that as much as to  say that I think no more of fighting a duel than of smoking a cigar?  Why, in my time, no two young men could be intimate till they had seen  the color of their blood! But ‘sdeath, sir, last evening, sailor-like,  I had taken a drop too much grog on board, and I ran you down. Shake  hands; I would rather take a hundred rebuffs from a Longueville than  cause his family the smallest regret.”    However coldly the young man tried to behave to the Comte de Kergarouet,  he could not resist the frank cordiality of his manner, and presently  gave him his hand.    “You were going out riding,” said the Count. “Do not let me detain you.  But, unless you have other plans, I beg you will come to dinner to-day  at the Villa Planat. My nephew, the Comte de Fontaine, is a man it is  essential that you should know. Ah, ha! And I propose to make up to you  for my clumsiness by introducing you to five of the prettiest women  in Paris. So, so, young man, your brow is clearing! I am fond of young  people, and I like to see them happy. Their happiness reminds me of the  good times of my youth, when adventures were not lacking, any more  than duels. We were gay dogs then! Nowadays you think and worry over  everything, as though there had never been a fifteenth and a sixteenth  century.”    “But, monsieur, are we not in the right? The sixteenth century only gave  religious liberty to Europe, and the nineteenth will give it political  lib----”    “Oh, we will not talk politics. I am a perfect old woman--ultra you see.  But I do not hinder young men from being revolutionary, so long as they  leave the King at liberty to disperse their assemblies.”    When they had gone a little way, and the Count and his companion were in  the heart of the woods, the old sailor pointed out a slender young  birch sapling, pulled up his horse, took out one of his pistols, and the  bullet was lodged in the heart of the tree, fifteen paces away.    “You see, my dear fellow, that I am not afraid of a duel,” he said with  comical gravity, as he looked at Monsieur Longueville.    “Nor am I,” replied the young man, promptly cocking his pistol; he aimed  at the hole made by the Comte’s bullet, and sent his own close to it.    “That is what I call a well-educated man,” cried the admiral with  enthusiasm.    During this ride with the youth, whom he already regarded as his nephew,  he found endless opportunities of catechizing him on all the trifles of  which a perfect knowledge constituted, according to his private code, an  accomplished gentleman.    “Have you any debts?” he at last asked of his companion, after many  other inquiries.    “No, monsieur.”    “What, you pay for all you have?”    “Punctually; otherwise we should lose our credit, and every sort of  respect.”    “But at least you have more than one mistress? Ah, you blush, comrade!  Well, manners have changed. All these notions of lawful order, Kantism,  and liberty have spoilt the young men. You have no Guimard now, no  Duthe, no creditors--and you know nothing of heraldry; why, my dear  young friend, you are not fully fledged. The man who does not sow his  wild oats in the spring sows them in the winter. If I have but eighty  thousand francs a year at the age of seventy, it is because I ran  through the capital at thirty. Oh! with my wife--in decency and honor.  However, your imperfections will not interfere with my introducing you  at the Pavillon Planat. Remember, you have promised to come, and I shall  expect you.”    “What an odd little old man!” said Longueville to himself. “He is so  jolly and hale; but though he wishes to seem a good fellow, I will not  trust him too far.”    Next day, at about four o’clock, when the house party were dispersed  in the drawing-rooms and billiard-room, a servant announced to the  inhabitants of the Villa Planat, “Monsieur DE Longueville.” On hearing  the name of the old admiral’s protege, every one, down to the player who  was about to miss his stroke, rushed in, as much to study Mademoiselle  de Fontaine’s countenance as to judge of this phoenix of men, who had  earned honorable mention to the detriment of so many rivals. A simple  but elegant style of dress, an air of perfect ease, polite manners, a  pleasant voice with a ring in it which found a response in the hearer’s  heart-strings, won the good-will of the family for Monsieur Longueville.  He did not seem unaccustomed to the luxury of the Receiver-General’s  ostentatious mansion. Though his conversation was that of a man of the  world, it was easy to discern that he had had a brilliant education, and  that his knowledge was as thorough as it was extensive. He knew so well  the right thing to say in a discussion on naval architecture, trivial,  it is true, started by the old admiral, that one of the ladies remarked  that he must have passed through the Ecole Polytechnique.    “And I think, madame,” he replied, “that I may regard it as an honor to  have got in.”    In spite of urgent pressing, he refused politely but firmly to be kept  to dinner, and put an end to the persistency of the ladies by saying  that he was the Hippocrates of his young sister, whose delicate health  required great care.    “Monsieur is perhaps a medical man?” asked one of Emilie’s  sisters-in-law with ironical meaning.    “Monsieur has left the Ecole Polytechnique,” Mademoiselle de Fontaine  kindly put in; her face had flushed with richer color, as she learned  that the young lady of the ball was Monsieur Longueville’s sister.    “But, my dear, he may be a doctor and yet have been to the Ecole  Polytechnique--is it not so, monsieur?”    “There is nothing to prevent it, madame,” replied the young man.    Every eye was on Emilie, who was gazing with uneasy curiosity at the  fascinating stranger. She breathed more freely when he added, not  without a smile, “I have not the honor of belonging to the medical  profession; and I even gave up going into the Engineers in order to  preserve my independence.”    “And you did well,” said the Count. “But how can you regard it as an  honor to be a doctor?” added the Breton nobleman. “Ah, my young friend,  such a man as you----”    “Monsieur le Comte, I respect every profession that has a useful  purpose.”    “Well, in that we agree. You respect those professions, I imagine, as a  young man respects a dowager.”    Monsieur Longueville made his visit neither too long nor too short. He  left at the moment when he saw that he had pleased everybody, and that  each one’s curiosity about him had been roused.    “He is a cunning rascal!” said the Count, coming into the drawing-room  after seeing him to the door.    Mademoiselle de Fontaine, who had been in the secret of this call, had  dressed with some care to attract the young man’s eye; but she had the  little disappointment of finding that he did not bestow on her so much  attention as she thought she deserved. The family were a good deal  surprised at the silence into which she had retired. Emilie generally  displayed all her arts for the benefit of newcomers, her witty prattle,  and the inexhaustible eloquence of her eyes and attitudes. Whether  it was that the young man’s pleasing voice and attractive manners had  charmed her, that she was seriously in love, and that this feeling had  worked a change in her, her demeanor had lost all its affectations.  Being simple and natural, she must, no doubt, have seemed more  beautiful. Some of her sisters, and an old lady, a friend of the family,  saw in this behavior a refinement of art. They supposed that Emilie,  judging the man worthy of her, intended to delay revealing her merits,  so as to dazzle him suddenly when she found that she pleased him. Every  member of the family was curious to know what this capricious creature  thought of the stranger; but when, during dinner, every one chose to  endow Monsieur Longueville with some fresh quality which no one else  had discovered, Mademoiselle de Fontaine sat for some time in silence. A  sarcastic remark of her uncle’s suddenly roused her from her apathy;  she said, somewhat epigrammatically, that such heavenly perfection  must cover some great defect, and that she would take good care how she  judged so gifted a man at first sight.    “Those who please everybody, please nobody,” she added; “and the worst  of all faults is to have none.”    Like all girls who are in love, Emilie cherished the hope of being  able to hide her feelings at the bottom of her heart by putting the  Argus-eyes that watched on the wrong tack; but by the end of a fortnight  there was not a member of the large family party who was not in this  little domestic secret. When Monsieur Longueville called for the third  time, Emilie believed it was chiefly for her sake. This discovery gave  her such intoxicating pleasure that she was startled as she reflected on  it. There was something in it very painful to her pride. Accustomed as  she was to be the centre of her world, she was obliged to recognize a  force that attracted her outside herself; she tried to resist, but she  could not chase from her heart the fascinating image of the young man.    Then came some anxiety. Two of Monsieur Longueville’s qualities,  very adverse to general curiosity, and especially to Mademoiselle de  Fontaine’s, were unexpected modesty and discretion. He never spoke of  himself, of his pursuits, or of his family. The hints Emilie threw out  in conversation, and the traps she laid to extract from the young fellow  some facts concerning himself, he could evade with the adroitness of a  diplomatist concealing a secret. If she talked of painting, he responded  as a connoisseur; if she sat down to play, he showed without conceit  that he was a very good pianist; one evening he delighted all the  party by joining his delightful voice to Emilie’s in one of Cimarosa’s  charming duets. But when they tried to find out whether he were a  professional singer, he baffled them so pleasantly that he did not  afford these women, practised as they were in the art of reading  feelings, the least chance of discovering to what social sphere he  belonged. However boldly the old uncle cast the boarding-hooks over the  vessel, Longueville slipped away cleverly, so as to preserve the charm  of mystery; and it was easy to him to remain the “handsome Stranger”   at the Villa, because curiosity never overstepped the bounds of good  breeding.    Emilie, distracted by this reserve, hoped to get more out of the sister  than the brother, in the form of confidences. Aided by her uncle, who  was as skilful in such manoeuvres as in handling a ship, she endeavored  to bring upon the scene the hitherto unseen figure of Mademoiselle Clara  Longueville. The family party at the Villa Planat soon expressed the  greatest desire to make the acquaintance of so amiable a young lady, and  to give her some amusement. An informal dance was proposed and accepted.  The ladies did not despair of making a young girl of sixteen talk.    Notwithstanding the little clouds piled up by suspicion and created by  curiosity, a light of joy shone in Emilie’s soul, for she found life  delicious when thus intimately connected with another than herself. She  began to understand the relations of life. Whether it is that happiness  makes us better, or that she was too fully occupied to torment other  people, she became less caustic, more gentle, and indulgent. This change  in her temper enchanted and amazed her family. Perhaps, at last, her  selfishness was being transformed to love. It was a deep delight to her  to look for the arrival of her bashful and unconfessed adorer. Though  they had not uttered a word of passion, she knew that she was loved, and  with what art did she not lead the stranger to unlock the stores of his  information, which proved to be varied! She perceived that she, too,  was being studied, and that made her endeavor to remedy the defects her  education had encouraged. Was not this her first homage to love, and  a bitter reproach to herself? She desired to please, and she was  enchanting; she loved, and she was idolized. Her family, knowing that  her pride would sufficiently protect her, gave her enough freedom to  enjoy the little childish delights which give to first love its charm  and its violence. More than once the young man and Mademoiselle de  Fontaine walked, tete-a-tete, in the avenues of the garden, where nature  was dressed like a woman going to a ball. More than once they had those  conversations, aimless and meaningless, in which the emptiest phrases  are those which cover the deepest feelings. They often admired together  the setting sun and its gorgeous coloring. They gathered daisies to pull  the petals off, and sang the most impassioned duets, using the notes set  down by Pergolesi or Rossini as faithful interpreters to express their  secrets.    The day of the dance came. Clara Longueville and her brother, whom the  servants persisted in honoring with the noble DE, were the principle  guests. For the first time in her life Mademoiselle de Fontaine felt  pleasure in a young girl’s triumph. She lavished on Clara in all  sincerity the gracious petting and little attentions which women  generally give each other only to excite the jealousy of men. Emilie,  had, indeed, an object in view; she wanted to discover some secrets.  But, being a girl, Mademoiselle Longueville showed even more mother-wit  than her brother, for she did not even look as if she were hiding a  secret, and kept the conversation to subjects unconnected with personal  interests, while, at the same time, she gave it so much charm that  Mademoiselle de Fontaine was almost envious, and called her “the Siren.”   Though Emilie had intended to make Clara talk, it was Clara, in fact,  who questioned Emilie; she had meant to judge her, and she was judged by  her; she was constantly provoked to find that she had betrayed her own  character in some reply which Clara had extracted from her, while her  modest and candid manner prohibited any suspicion of perfidy. There was  a moment when Mademoiselle de Fontaine seemed sorry for an ill-judged  sally against the commonalty to which Clara had led her.    “Mademoiselle,” said the sweet child, “I have heard so much of you from  Maximilien that I had the keenest desire to know you, out of affection  for him; but is not a wish to know you a wish to love you?”    “My dear Clara, I feared I might have displeased you by speaking thus of  people who are not of noble birth.”    “Oh, be quite easy. That sort of discussion is pointless in these days.  As for me, it does not affect me. I am beside the question.”    Ambitious as the answer might seem, it filled Mademoiselle de Fontaine  with the deepest joy; for, like all infatuated people, she explained it,  as oracles are explained, in the sense that harmonized with her wishes;  she began dancing again in higher spirits than ever, as she watched  Longueville, whose figure and grace almost surpassed those of her  imaginary ideal. She felt added satisfaction in believing him to be well  born, her black eyes sparkled, and she danced with all the pleasure that  comes of dancing in the presence of the being we love. The couple had  never understood each other as well as at this moment; more than once  they felt their finger tips thrill and tremble as they were married in  the figures of the dance.    The early autumn had come to the handsome pair, in the midst of country  festivities and pleasures; they had abandoned themselves softly to the  tide of the sweetest sentiment in life, strengthening it by a thousand  little incidents which any one can imagine; for love is in some respects  always the same. They studied each other through it all, as much as  lovers can.    “Well, well; a flirtation never turned so quickly into a love match,”   said the old uncle, who kept an eye on the two young people as a  naturalist watches an insect in the microscope.    The speech alarmed Monsieur and Madame Fontaine. The old Vendeen had  ceased to be so indifferent to his daughter’s prospects as he had  promised to be. He went to Paris to seek information, and found none.  Uneasy at this mystery, and not yet knowing what might be the outcome  of the inquiry which he had begged a Paris friend to institute with  reference to the family of Longueville, he thought it his duty to warn  his daughter to behave prudently. The fatherly admonition was received  with mock submission spiced with irony.    “At least, my dear Emilie, if you love him, do not own it to him.”    “My dear father, I certainly do love him; but I will await your  permission before I tell him so.”    “But remember, Emilie, you know nothing of his family or his pursuits.”    “I may be ignorant, but I am content to be. But, father, you wished to  see me married; you left me at liberty to make my choice; my choice is  irrevocably made--what more is needful?”    “It is needful to ascertain, my dear, whether the man of your choice  is the son of a peer of France,” the venerable gentleman retorted  sarcastically.    Emilie was silent for a moment. She presently raised her head, looked at  her father, and said somewhat anxiously, “Are not the Longuevilles----?”    “They became extinct in the person of the old Duc de Rostein-Limbourg,  who perished on the scaffold in 1793. He was the last representative of  the last and younger branch.”    “But, papa, there are some very good families descended from bastards.  The history of France swarms with princes bearing the bar sinister on  their shields.”    “Your ideas are much changed,” said the old man, with a smile.    The following day was the last that the Fontaine family were to spend at  the Pavillon Planat. Emilie, greatly disturbed by her father’s warning,  awaited with extreme impatience the hour at which young Longueville was  in the habit of coming, to wring some explanation from him. She went out  after dinner, and walked alone across the shrubbery towards an arbor fit  for lovers, where she knew that the eager youth would seek her; and  as she hastened thither she considered of the best way to discover so  important a matter without compromising herself--a rather difficult  thing! Hitherto no direct avowal had sanctioned the feelings which bound  her to this stranger. Like Maximilien, she had secretly enjoyed the  sweetness of first love; but both were equally proud, and each feared to  confess that love.    Maximilien Longueville, to whom Clara had communicated her not unfounded  suspicions as to Emilie’s character, was by turns carried away by the  violence of a young man’s passion, and held back by a wish to know and  test the woman to whom he would be entrusting his happiness. His love  had not hindered him from perceiving in Emilie the prejudices which  marred her young nature; but before attempting to counteract them, he  wished to be sure that she loved him, for he would no sooner risk the  fate of his love than of his life. He had, therefore, persistently kept  a silence to which his looks, his behavior, and his smallest actions  gave the lie.    On her side, the self-respect natural to a young girl, augmented in  Mademoiselle de Fontaine by the monstrous vanity founded on her birth  and beauty, kept her from meeting the declaration half-way, which her  growing passion sometimes urged her to invite. Thus the lovers had  instinctively understood the situation without explaining to each  other their secret motives. There are times in life when such vagueness  pleases youthful minds. Just because each had postponed speaking too  long, they seemed to be playing a cruel game of suspense. He was trying  to discover whether he was beloved, by the effort any confession would  cost his haughty mistress; she every minute hoped that he would break a  too respectful silence.    Emilie, seated on a rustic bench, was reflecting on all that had  happened in these three months full of enchantment. Her father’s  suspicions were the last that could appeal to her; she even disposed  of them at once by two or three of those reflections natural to an  inexperienced girl, which, to her, seemed conclusive. Above all, she was  convinced that it was impossible that she should deceive herself. All  the summer through she had not been able to detect in Maximilien a  single gesture, or a single word, which could indicate a vulgar origin  or vulgar occupations; nay more, his manner of discussing things  revealed a man devoted to the highest interests of the nation.  “Besides,” she reflected, “an office clerk, a banker, or a merchant,  would not be at leisure to spend a whole season in paying his addresses  to me in the midst of woods and fields; wasting his time as freely as a  nobleman who has life before him free of all care.”    She had given herself up to meditations far more interesting to her  than these preliminary thoughts, when a slight rustling in the leaves  announced to her than Maximilien had been watching her for a minute, not  probably without admiration.    “Do you know that it is very wrong to take a young girl thus unawares?”   she asked him, smiling.    “Especially when they are busy with their secrets,” replied Maximilien  archly.    “Why should I not have my secrets? You certainly have yours.”    “Then you really were thinking of your secrets?” he went on, laughing.    “No, I was thinking of yours. My own, I know.”    “But perhaps my secrets are yours, and yours mine,” cried the young man,  softly seizing Mademoiselle de Fontaine’s hand and drawing it through  his arm.    After walking a few steps they found themselves under a clump of trees  which the hues of the sinking sun wrapped in a haze of red and brown.  This touch of natural magic lent a certain solemnity to the moment. The  young man’s free and eager action, and, above all, the throbbing of his  surging heart, whose hurried beating spoke to Emilie’s arm, stirred her  to an emotion that was all the more disturbing because it was produced  by the simplest and most innocent circumstances. The restraint under  which the young girls of the upper class live gives incredible force to  any explosion of feeling, and to meet an impassioned lover is one of  the greatest dangers they can encounter. Never had Emilie and Maximilien  allowed their eyes to say so much that they dared never speak. Carried  a way by this intoxication, they easily forgot the petty stipulations  of pride, and the cold hesitancies of suspicion. At first, indeed, they  could only express themselves by a pressure of hands which interpreted  their happy thoughts.    After slowing pacing a few steps in long silence, Mademoiselle de  Fontaine spoke. “Monsieur, I have a question to ask you,” she said  trembling, and in an agitated voice. “But, remember, I beg, that it is  in a manner compulsory on me, from the rather singular position I am in  with regard to my family.”    A pause, terrible to Emilie, followed these sentences, which she had  almost stammered out. During the minute while it lasted, the girl,  haughty as she was, dared not meet the flashing eye of the man she  loved, for she was secretly conscious of the meanness of the next words  she added: “Are you of noble birth?”    As soon as the words were spoken she wished herself at the bottom of a  lake.    “Mademoiselle,” Longueville gravely replied, and his face assumed a sort  of stern dignity, “I promise to answer you truly as soon as you shall  have answered in all sincerity a question I will put to you!”--He  released her arm, and the girl suddenly felt alone in the world, as he  said: “What is your object in questioning me as to my birth?”    She stood motionless, cold, and speechless.    “Mademoiselle,” Maximilien went on, “let us go no further if we do not  understand each other. I love you,” he said, in a voice of deep emotion.  “Well, then,” he added, as he heard the joyful exclamation she could not  suppress, “why ask me if I am of noble birth?”    “Could he speak so if he were not?” cried a voice within her, which  Emilie believed came from the depths of her heart. She gracefully raised  her head, seemed to find new life in the young man’s gaze, and held out  her hand as if to renew the alliance.    “You thought I cared very much for dignities?” said she with keen  archness.    “I have no titles to offer my wife,” he replied, in a half-sportive,  half-serious tone. “But if I choose one of high rank, and among women  whom a wealthy home has accustomed to the luxury and pleasures of a  fine fortune, I know what such a choice requires of me. Love gives  everything,” he added lightly, “but only to lovers. Once married,  they need something more than the vault of heaven and the carpet of a  meadow.”    “He is rich,” she reflected. “As to titles, perhaps he only wants to try  me. He has been told that I am mad about titles, and bent on marrying  none but a peer’s son. My priggish sisters have played me that  trick.”--“I assure you, monsieur,” she said aloud, “that I have had  very extravagant ideas about life and the world; but now,” she added  pointedly, looking at him in a perfectly distracting way, “I know where  true riches are to be found for a wife.”    “I must believe that you are speaking from the depths of your heart,”   he said, with gentle gravity. “But this winter, my dear Emilie, in less  than two months perhaps, I may be proud of what I shall have to offer  you if you care for the pleasures of wealth. This is the only secret I  shall keep locked here,” and he laid his hand on his heart, “for on its  success my happiness depends. I dare not say ours.”    “Yes, yes, ours!”    Exchanging such sweet nothings, they slowly made their way back to  rejoin the company. Mademoiselle de Fontaine had never found her lover  more amiable or wittier: his light figure, his engaging manners, seemed  to her more charming than ever, since the conversation which had made  her to some extent the possessor of a heart worthy to be the envy of  every woman. They sang an Italian duet with so much expression that the  audience applauded enthusiastically. Their adieux were in a conventional  tone, which concealed their happiness. In short, this day had been to  Emilie like a chain binding her more closely than ever to the Stranger’s  fate. The strength and dignity he had displayed in the scene when they  had confessed their feelings had perhaps impressed Mademoiselle de  Fontaine with the respect without which there is no true love.    When she was left alone in the drawing-room with her father, the old man  went up to her affectionately, held her hands, and asked her whether she  had gained any light at to Monsieur Longueville’s family and fortune.    “Yes, my dear father,” she replied, “and I am happier than I could have  hoped. In short, Monsieur de Longueville is the only man I could ever  marry.”    “Very well, Emilie,” said the Count, “then I know what remains for me to  do.”    “Do you know of any impediment?” she asked, in sincere alarm.    “My dear child, the young man is totally unknown to me; but unless he  is not a man of honor, so long as you love him, he is as dear to me as a  son.”    “Not a man of honor!” exclaimed Emilie. “As to that, I am quite easy.  My uncle, who introduced him to us, will answer for him. Say, my dear  uncle, has he been a filibuster, an outlaw, a pirate?”    “I knew I should find myself in this fix!” cried the old sailor,  waking up. He looked round the room, but his niece had vanished “like  Saint-Elmo’s fires,” to use his favorite expression.    “Well, uncle,” Monsieur de Fontaine went on, “how could you hide from  us all you knew about this young man? You must have seen how anxious we  have been. Is Monsieur de Longueville a man of family?”    “I don’t know him from Adam or Eve,” said the Comte de Kergarouet.  “Trusting to that crazy child’s tact, I got him here by a method of my  own. I know that the boy shoots with a pistol to admiration, hunts well,  plays wonderfully at billiards, at chess, and at backgammon; he handles  the foils, and rides a horse like the late Chevalier de Saint-Georges.  He has a thorough knowledge of all our vintages. He is as good an  arithmetician as Bareme, draws, dances, and sings well. The devil’s in  it! what more do you want? If that is not a perfect gentleman, find me  a bourgeois who knows all this, or any man who lives more nobly than he  does. Does he do anything, I ask you? Does he compromise his dignity  by hanging about an office, bowing down before the upstarts you call  Directors-General? He walks upright. He is a man.--However, I have  just found in my waistcoat pocket the card he gave me when he fancied  I wanted to cut his throat, poor innocent. Young men are very  simple-minded nowadays! Here it is.”    “Rue du Sentier, No. 5,” said Monsieur de Fontaine, trying to recall  among all the information he had received, something which might concern  the stranger. “What the devil can it mean? Messrs. Palma, Werbrust &amp;  Co., wholesale dealers in muslins, calicoes, and printed cotton goods,  live there.--Stay, I have it: Longueville the deputy has an interest in  their house. Well, but so far as I know, Longueville has but one son  of two-and-thirty, who is not at all like our man, and to whom he gave  fifty thousand francs a year that he might marry a minister’s daughter;  he wants to be made a peer like the rest of ‘em.--I never heard him  mention this Maximilien. Has he a daughter? What is this girl Clara?  Besides, it is open to any adventurer to call himself Longueville.  But is not the house of Palma, Werbrust &amp; Co. half ruined by some  speculation in Mexico or the Indies? I will clear all this up.”    “You speak a soliloquy as if you were on the stage, and seem to account  me a cipher,” said the old admiral suddenly. “Don’t you know that if he  is a gentleman, I have more than one bag in my hold that will stop any  leak in his fortune?”    “As to that, if he is a son of Longueville’s, he will want nothing;  but,” said Monsieur de Fontaine, shaking his head from side to side,  “his father has not even washed off the stains of his origin. Before the  Revolution he was an attorney, and the DE he has since assumed no more  belongs to him than half of his fortune.”    “Pooh! pooh! happy those whose fathers were hanged!” cried the admiral  gaily.        Three or four days after this memorable day, on one of those fine  mornings in the month of November, which show the boulevards cleaned by  the sharp cold of an early frost, Mademoiselle de Fontaine, wrapped in a  new style of fur cape, of which she wished to set the fashion, went out  with two of her sisters-in-law, on whom she had been wont to discharge  her most cutting remarks. The three women were tempted to the drive,  less by their desire to try a very elegant carriage, and wear gowns  which were to set the fashion for the winter, than by their wish to see  a cape which a friend had observed in a handsome lace and linen shop at  the corner of the Rue de la Paix. As soon as they were in the shop the  Baronne de Fontaine pulled Emilie by the sleeve, and pointed out to her  Maximilien Longueville seated behind the desk, and engaged in paying out  the change for a gold piece to one of the workwomen with whom he seemed  to be in consultation. The “handsome stranger” held in his hand a parcel  of patterns, which left no doubt as to his honorable profession.    Emilie felt an icy shudder, though no one perceived it. Thanks to the  good breeding of the best society, she completely concealed the rage in  her heart, and answered her sister-in-law with the words, “I knew it,”   with a fulness of intonation and inimitable decision which the most  famous actress of the time might have envied her. She went straight up  to the desk. Longueville looked up, put the patterns in his pocket  with distracting coolness, bowed to Mademoiselle de Fontaine, and came  forward, looking at her keenly.    “Mademoiselle,” he said to the shopgirl, who followed him, looking very  much disturbed, “I will send to settle that account; my house deals  in that way. But here,” he whispered into her ear, as he gave her a  thousand-franc note, “take this--it is between ourselves.--You will  forgive me, I trust, mademoiselle,” he added, turning to Emilie. “You  will kindly excuse the tyranny of business matters.”    “Indeed, monsieur, it seems to me that it is no concern of mine,”   replied Mademoiselle de Fontaine, looking at him with a bold expression  of sarcastic indifference which might have made any one believe that she  now saw him for the first time.    “Do you really mean it?” asked Maximilien in a broken voice.    Emilie turned her back upon him with amazing insolence. These words,  spoken in an undertone, had escaped the ears of her two sisters-in-law.  When, after buying the cape, the three ladies got into the carriage  again, Emilie, seated with her back to the horses, could not resist one  last comprehensive glance into the depths of the odious shop, where she  saw Maximilien standing with his arms folded, in the attitude of a man  superior to the disaster that has so suddenly fallen on him. Their eyes  met and flashed implacable looks. Each hoped to inflict a cruel wound  on the heart of a lover. In one instant they were as far apart as if one  had been in China and the other in Greenland.    Does not the breath of vanity wither everything? Mademoiselle de  Fontaine, a prey to the most violent struggle that can torture the heart  of a young girl, reaped the richest harvest of anguish that prejudice  and narrow-mindedness ever sowed in a human soul. Her face, but just now  fresh and velvety, was streaked with yellow lines and red patches; the  paleness of her cheeks seemed every now and then to turn green. Hoping  to hide her despair from her sisters, she would laugh as she pointed out  some ridiculous dress or passer-by; but her laughter was spasmodic. She  was more deeply hurt by their unspoken compassion than by any satirical  comments for which she might have revenged herself. She exhausted her  wit in trying to engage them in a conversation, in which she tried to  expend her fury in senseless paradoxes, heaping on all men engaged in  trade the bitterest insults and witticisms in the worst taste.    On getting home, she had an attack of fever, which at first assumed  a somewhat serious character. By the end of a month the care of her  parents and of the physician restored her to her family.    Every one hoped that this lesson would be severe enough to subdue  Emilie’s nature; but she insensibly fell into her old habits and threw  herself again into the world of fashion. She declared that there was no  disgrace in making a mistake. If she, like her father, had a vote in the  Chamber, she would move for an edict, she said, by which all merchants,  and especially dealers in calico, should be branded on the forehead,  like Berri sheep, down to the third generation. She wished that none but  nobles should have the right to wear the antique French costume, which  was so becoming to the courtiers of Louis XV. To hear her, it was a  misfortune for France, perhaps, that there was no outward and visible  difference between a merchant and a peer of France. And a hundred more  such pleasantries, easy to imagine, were rapidly poured out when any  accident brought up the subject.    But those who loved Emilie could see through all her banter a tinge of  melancholy. It was clear that Maximilien Longueville still reigned over  that inexorable heart. Sometimes she would be as gentle as she had been  during the brief summer that had seen the birth of her love; sometimes,  again, she was unendurable. Every one made excuses for her inequality of  temper, which had its source in sufferings at once secret and known to  all. The Comte de Kergarouet had some influence over her, thanks to his  increased prodigality, a kind of consolation which rarely fails of its  effect on a Parisian girl.    The first ball at which Mademoiselle de Fontaine appeared was at the  Neapolitan ambassador’s. As she took her place in the first quadrille  she saw, a few yards away from her, Maximilien Longueville, who nodded  slightly to her partner.    “Is that young man a friend of yours?” she asked, with a scornful air.    “Only my brother,” he replied.    Emilie could not help starting. “Ah!” he continued, “and he is the  noblest soul living----”    “Do you know my name?” asked Emilie, eagerly interrupting him.    “No, mademoiselle. It is a crime, I confess, not to remember a name  which is on every lip--I ought to say in every heart. But I have a valid  excuse. I have but just arrived from Germany. My ambassador, who is in  Paris on leave, sent me here this evening to take care of his amiable  wife, whom you may see yonder in that corner.”    “A perfect tragic mask!” said Emilie, after looking at the ambassadress.    “And yet that is her ballroom face!” said the young man, laughing.  “I shall have to dance with her! So I thought I might have some  compensation.” Mademoiselle de Fontaine courtesied. “I was very much  surprised,” the voluble young secretary went on, “to find my brother  here. On arriving from Vienna I heard that the poor boy was ill in bed;  and I counted on seeing him before coming to this ball; but good policy  will always allow us to indulge family affection. The Padrona della case  would not give me time to call on my poor Maximilien.”    “Then, monsieur, your brother is not, like you, in diplomatic  employment.”    “No,” said the attache, with a sigh, “the poor fellow sacrificed himself  for me. He and my sister Clara have renounced their share of my father’s  fortune to make an eldest son of me. My father dreams of a peerage, like  all who vote for the ministry. Indeed, it is promised him,” he added  in an undertone. “After saving up a little capital my brother joined a  banking firm, and I hear he has just effected a speculation in Brazil  which may make him a millionaire. You see me in the highest spirits at  having been able, by my diplomatic connections, to contribute to his  success. I am impatiently expecting a dispatch from the Brazilian  Legation, which will help to lift the cloud from his brow. What do you  think of him?”    “Well, your brother’s face does not look to me like that of a man busied  with money matters.”    The young attache shot a scrutinizing glance at the apparently calm face  of his partner.    “What!” he exclaimed, with a smile, “can young ladies read the thoughts  of love behind the silent brow?”    “Your brother is in love, then?” she asked, betrayed into a movement of  curiosity.    “Yes; my sister Clara, to whom he is as devoted as a mother, wrote to  me that he had fallen in love this summer with a very pretty girl; but I  have had no further news of the affair. Would you believe that the poor  boy used to get up at five in the morning, and went off to settle his  business that he might be back by four o’clock in the country where the  lady was? In fact, he ruined a very nice thoroughbred that I had just  given him. Forgive my chatter, mademoiselle; I have but just come home  from Germany. For a year I have heard no decent French, I have been  weaned from French faces, and satiated with Germans, to such a degree  that, I believe, in my patriotic mania, I could talk to the chimeras on  a French candlestick. And if I talk with a lack of reserve unbecoming  in a diplomatist, the fault is yours, mademoiselle. Was it not you who  pointed out my brother? When he is the theme I become inexhaustible. I  should like to proclaim to all the world how good and generous he is. He  gave up no less than a hundred thousand francs a year, the income from  the Longueville property.”    If Mademoiselle de Fontaine had the benefit of these important  revelations, it was partly due to the skill with which she continued to  question her confiding partner from the moment when she found that he  was the brother of her scorned lover.    “And could you, without being grieved, see your brother selling muslin  and calico?” asked Emilie, at the end of the third figure of the  quadrille.    “How do you know that?” asked the attache. “Thank God, though I pour out  a flood of words, I have already acquired the art of not telling more  than I intend, like all the other diplomatic apprentices I know.”    “You told me, I assure you.”    Monsieur de Longueville looked at Mademoiselle de Fontaine with a  surprise that was full of perspicacity. A suspicion flashed upon him. He  glanced inquiringly from his brother to his partner, guessed everything,  clasped his hands, fixed his eyes on the ceiling, and began to laugh,  saying, “I am an idiot! You are the handsomest person here; my brother  keeps stealing glances at you; he is dancing in spite of his illness,  and you pretend not to see him. Make him happy,” he added, as he led  her back to her old uncle. “I shall not be jealous, but I shall always  shiver a little at calling you my sister----”    The lovers, however, were to prove as inexorable to each other as they  were to themselves. At about two in the morning, refreshments were  served in an immense corridor, where, to leave persons of the same  coterie free to meet each other, the tables were arranged as in a  restaurant. By one of those accidents which always happen to lovers,  Mademoiselle de Fontaine found herself at a table next to that at which  the more important guests were seated. Maximilien was of the group.  Emilie, who lent an attentive ear to her neighbors’ conversation,  overheard one of those dialogues into which a young woman so easily  falls with a young man who has the grace and style of Maximilien  Longueville. The lady talking to the young banker was a Neapolitan  duchess, whose eyes shot lightning flashes, and whose skin had the sheen  of satin. The intimate terms on which Longueville affected to be with  her stung Mademoiselle de Fontaine all the more because she had just  given her lover back twenty times as much tenderness as she had ever  felt for him before.    “Yes, monsieur, in my country true love can make every kind of  sacrifice,” the Duchess was saying, in a simper.    “You have more passion than Frenchwomen,” said Maximilien, whose burning  gaze fell on Emilie. “They are all vanity.”    “Monsieur,” Emilie eagerly interposed, “is it not very wrong to  calumniate your own country? Devotion is to be found in every nation.”    “Do you imagine, mademoiselle,” retorted the Italian, with a sardonic  smile, “that a Parisian would be capable of following her lover all over  the world?”    “Oh, madame, let us understand each other. She would follow him to a  desert and live in a tent but not to sit in a shop.”    A disdainful gesture completed her meaning. Thus, under the influence of  her disastrous education, Emile for the second time killed her budding  happiness, and destroyed its prospects of life. Maximilien’s apparent  indifference, and a woman’s smile, had wrung from her one of those  sarcasms whose treacherous zest always let her astray.    “Mademoiselle,” said Longueville, in a low voice, under cover of the  noise made by the ladies as they rose from the table, “no one will ever  more ardently desire your happiness than I; permit me to assure you  of this, as I am taking leave of you. I am starting for Italy in a few  days.”    “With a Duchess, no doubt?”    “No, but perhaps with a mortal blow.”    “Is not that pure fancy?” asked Emilie, with an anxious glance.    “No,” he replied. “There are wounds which never heal.”    “You are not to go,” said the girl, imperiously, and she smiled.    “I shall go,” replied Maximilien, gravely.    “You will find me married on your return, I warn you,” she said  coquettishly.    “I hope so.”    “Impertinent wretch!” she exclaimed. “How cruel a revenge!”    A fortnight later Maximilien set out with his sister Clara for the warm  and poetic scenes of beautiful Italy, leaving Mademoiselle de Fontaine  a prey to the most vehement regret. The young Secretary to the Embassy  took up his brother’s quarrel, and contrived to take signal vengeance on  Emilie’s disdain by making known the occasion of the lovers’ separation.  He repaid his fair partner with interest all the sarcasm with which  she had formerly attacked Maximilien, and often made more than one  Excellency smile by describing the fair foe of the counting-house, the  amazon who preached a crusade against bankers, the young girl whose  love had evaporated before a bale of muslin. The Comte de Fontaine was  obliged to use his influence to procure an appointment to Russia for  Auguste Longueville in order to protect his daughter from the ridicule  heaped upon her by this dangerous young persecutor.    Not long after, the Ministry being compelled to raise a levy of peers to  support the aristocratic party, trembling in the Upper Chamber under the  lash of an illustrious writer, gave Monsieur Guiraudin de Longueville a  peerage, with the title of Vicomte. Monsieur de Fontaine also obtained  a peerage, the reward due as much to his fidelity in evil days as to his  name, which claimed a place in the hereditary Chamber.    About this time Emilie, now of age, made, no doubt, some serious  reflections on life, for her tone and manners changed perceptibly.  Instead of amusing herself by saying spiteful things to her uncle, she  lavished on him the most affectionate attentions; she brought him his  stick with a persevering devotion that made the cynical smile, she  gave him her arm, rode in his carriage, and accompanied him in all his  drives; she even persuaded him that she liked the smell of tobacco, and  read him his favorite paper La Quotidienne in the midst of clouds of  smoke, which the malicious old sailor intentionally blew over her;  she learned piquet to be a match for the old count; and this fantastic  damsel even listened without impatience to his periodical narratives of  the battles of the Belle-Poule, the manoeuvres of the Ville de Paris, M.  de Suffren’s first expedition, or the battle of Aboukir.    Though the old sailor had often said that he knew his longitude and  latitude too well to allow himself to be captured by a young corvette,  one fine morning Paris drawing-rooms heard the news of the marriage of  Mademoiselle de Fontaine to the Comte de Kergarouet. The young Countess  gave splendid entertainments to drown thought; but she, no doubt,  found a void at the bottom of the whirlpool; luxury was ineffectual to  disguise the emptiness and grief of her sorrowing soul; for the most",38.02,14.1,18.2,9.59,21.0,7.53,997,14.75,21.19,14th and 15th grade
5,Seven Menr,"  novel. I heard myself shouting a confused precis of the plot. The place  where we were sitting was near the foot of the great marble staircase.  I said how beautiful the staircase was. The Duchess of Mull said she had  never cared very much for that staircase. The Duke, after a pause, said  he had “often heard old Mr. Abraham Hayward hold a whole dinner table.”   There were long and frequent pauses--between which I heard myself  talking loudly, frantically, sinking lower and lower in the esteem of my  small audience. I felt like a man drowning under the eyes of an elderly  couple who sit on the bank regretting that they can offer NO assistance.  Presently the Duke looked at his watch and said to the Duchess that it  was “time to be thinking of bed.”    ‘They rose, as it were from the bank, and left me, so to speak, under  water. I watched them as they passed slowly out of sight up the marble  staircase which I had mispraised. I turned and surveyed the brilliant,  silent scene presented by the card-players.    ‘I wondered what old Mr. Abraham Hayward would have done in my place.  Would he have just darted in among those tables and “held” them? I  presumed that he would not have stolen silently away, quickly and  cravenly away, up the marble staircase--as _I_ did.    ‘I don’t know which was the greater, the relief or the humiliation of  finding myself in my bedroom. Perhaps the humiliation was the greater.  There, on a chair, was my grand new smoking-suit, laid out for me--what  a mockery! Once I had foreseen myself wearing it in the smoking-room  at a late hour--the centre of a group of eminent men entranced by the  brilliancy of my conversation. And now--! I was nothing but a small,  dull, soup-stained, sticking-plastered, nerve-racked recluse. Nerves,  yes. I assured myself that I had not seen--what I had seemed to see. All  very odd, of course, and very unpleasant, but easily explained. Nerves.  Excitement of coming to Keeb too much for me. A good night’s rest: that  was all I needed. To-morrow I should laugh at myself.    ‘I wondered that I wasn’t tired physically. There my grand new silk  pyjamas were, yet I felt no desire to go to bed... none while it was  still possible for me to go. The little writing-table at the foot of my  bed seemed to invite me. I had brought with me in my portmanteau a sheaf  of letters, letters that I had purposely left unanswered in order that I  might answer them on KEEB HALL note-paper. These the footman had neatly  laid beside the blotting-pad on that little writing-table at the foot  of the bed. I regretted that the notepaper stacked there had no ducal  coronet on it. What matter? The address sufficed. If I hadn’t yet made a  good impression on the people who were staying here, I could at any rate  make one on the people who weren’t. I sat down. I set to work. I wrote a  prodigious number of fluent and graceful notes.    ‘Some of these were to strangers who wanted my autograph. I was always  delighted to send my autograph, and never perfunctory in the manner of  sending it.... “Dear Madam,” I remember writing to somebody that night,  “were it not that you make your request for it so charmingly, I should  hesitate to send you that which rarity alone can render valuable.--Yours  truly, Hilary Maltby.” I remember reading this over and wondering  whether the word “render” looked rather commercial. It was in the act  of wondering thus that I raised my eyes from the note-paper and saw,  through the bars of the brass bedstead, the naked sole of a large human  foot--saw beyond it the calf of a great leg; a nightshirt; and the face  of Stephen Braxton. I did not move.      ‘I thought of making a dash for the door, dashing out into the corridor,  shouting at the top of my voice for help. I sat quite still.    ‘What kept me to my chair was the fear that if I tried to reach the door  Braxton would spring off the bed to intercept me. If I sat quite still  perhaps he wouldn’t move. I felt that if he moved I should collapse  utterly.    ‘I watched him, and he watched me. He lay there with his body  half-raised, one elbow propped on the pillow, his jaw sunk on his  breast; and from under his black brows he watched me steadily.    ‘No question of mere nerves now. That hope was gone. No mere optical  delusion, this abiding presence. Here Braxton was. He and I were  together in the bright, silent room. How long would he be content to  watch me?    ‘Eleven nights ago he had given me one horrible look. It was this look  that I had to meet, in infinite prolongation, now, not daring to shift  my eyes. He lay as motionless as I sat. I did not hear him breathing,  but I knew, by the rise and fall of his chest under his nightshirt,  that he was breathing heavily. Suddenly I started to my feet. For he had  moved. He had raised one hand slowly. He was stroking his chin. And  as he did so, and as he watched me, his mouth gradually slackened to a  grin. It was worse, it was more malign, this grin, than the scowl that  remained with it; and its immediate effect on me was an impulse that was  as hard to resist as it was hateful. The window was open. It was nearer  to me than the door. I could have reached it in time....    ‘Well, I live to tell the tale. I stood my ground. And there dawned on  me now a new fact in regard to my companion. I had all the while been  conscious of something abnormal in his attitude--a lack of ease in his  gross possessiveness. I saw now the reason for this effect. The pillow  on which his elbow rested was still uniformly puffed and convex; like  a pillow untouched. His elbow rested but on the very surface of it,  not changing the shape of it at all. His body made not the least furrow  along the bed.... He had no weight.    ‘I knew that if I leaned forward and thrust my hand between those brass  rails, to clutch his foot, I should clutch--nothing. He wasn’t tangible.  He was realistic. He wasn’t real. He was opaque. He wasn’t solid.    ‘Odd as it may seem to you, these certainties took the edge off my  horror. During that walk with Lady Rodfitten, I had been appalled by the  doubt that haunted me. But now the very confirmation of that doubt gave  me a sort of courage: I could cope better with anything to-night than  with actual Braxton. And the measure of the relief I felt is that I sat  down again on my chair.    ‘More than once there came to me a wild hope that the thing might be an  optical delusion, after all. Then would I shut my eyes tightly, shaking  my head sharply; but, when I looked again, there the presence was, of  course. It--he--not actual Braxton but, roughly speaking, Braxton--had  come to stay. I was conscious of intense fatigue, taut and alert though  every particle of me was; so that I became, in the course of that  ghastly night, conscious of a great envy also. For some time before the  dawn came in through the window, Braxton’s eyes had been closed; little  by little now his head drooped sideways, then fell on his forearm and  rested there. He was asleep.    ‘Cut off from sleep, I had a great longing for smoke. I had cigarettes  on me, I had matches on me. But I didn’t dare to strike a match. The  sound might have waked Braxton up. In slumber he was less terrible,  though perhaps more odious. I wasn’t so much afraid now as indignant.  “It’s intolerable,” I sat saying to myself, “utterly intolerable!”    ‘I had to bear it, nevertheless. I was aware that I had, in some degree,  brought it on myself. If I hadn’t interfered and lied, actual Braxton  would have been here at Keeb, and I at this moment sleeping soundly. But  this was no excuse for Braxton. Braxton didn’t know what I had done. He  was merely envious of me. And--wanly I puzzled it out in the dawn--by  very force of the envy, hatred, and malice in him he had projected  hither into my presence this simulacrum of himself. I had known that he  would be thinking of me. I had known that the thought of me at Keeb Hall  would be of the last bitterness to his most sacred feelings. But--I had  reckoned without the passionate force and intensity of the man’s nature.    ‘If by this same strength and intensity he had merely projected himself  as an invisible guest under the Duchess’ roof--if his feat had been  wholly, as perhaps it was in part, a feat of mere wistfulness and  longing--then I should have felt really sorry for him; and my conscience  would have soundly rated me in his behalf. But no; if the wretched  creature HAD been invisible to me, I shouldn’t have thought of Braxton  at all--except with gladness that he wasn’t here. That he was visible to  me, and to me alone, wasn’t any sign of proper remorse within me. It was  but the gauge of his incredible ill-will.    ‘Well, it seemed to me that he was avenged--with a vengeance. There I  sat, hot-browed from sleeplessness, cold in the feet, stiff in the legs,  cowed and indignant all through--sat there in the broadening daylight,  and in that new evening suit of mine with the Braxtonised shirtfront  and waistcoat that by day were more than ever loathsome. Literature’s  Ambassador at Keeb.... I rose gingerly from my chair, and caught  sight of my face, of my Braxtonised cheek, in the mirror. I heard  the twittering of birds in distant trees. I saw through my window the  elaborate landscape of the Duke’s grounds, all soft in the grey bloom of  early morning. I think I was nearer to tears than I had ever been since  I was a child. But the weakness passed. I turned towards the personage  on my bed, and, summoning all such power as was in me, WILLED him to be  gone. My effort was not without result--an inadequate result. Braxton  turned in his sleep.    ‘I resumed my seat, and... and... sat up staring and blinking, at a tall  man with red hair. “I must have fallen asleep,” I said. “Yessir,” he  replied; and his toneless voice touched in me one or two springs  of memory: I was at Keeb; this was the footman who looked after me.  But--why wasn’t I in bed? Had I--no, surely it had been no nightmare.  Surely I had SEEN Braxton on that white bed.    ‘The footman was impassively putting away my smoking-suit. I was too  dazed to wonder what he thought of me. Nor did I attempt to stifle a  cry when, a moment later, turning in my chair, I beheld Braxton leaning  moodily against the mantelpiece. “Are you unwell sir?” asked the footman.  “No,” I said faintly, “I’m quite well.”--“Yessir. Will you wear the blue  suit or the grey?”--“The grey.”--“Yessir.”--It seemed almost incredible  that HE didn’t see Braxton; HE didn’t appear to me one whit more solid  than the night-shirted brute who stood against the mantelpiece and  watched him lay out my things.--“Shall I let your bath-water run  now sir?”--“Please, yes.”--“Your bathroom’s the second door to the left  sir.”--He went out with my bath-towel and sponge, leaving me alone with  Braxton.    ‘I rose to my feet, mustering once more all the strength that was in  me. Hoping against hope, with set teeth and clenched hands, I faced him,  thrust forth my will at him, with everything but words commanded him to  vanish--to cease to be.    ‘Suddenly, utterly, he vanished. And you can imagine the truly exquisite  sense of triumph that thrilled me and continued to thrill me till I went  into the bathroom and found him in my bath.    ‘Quivering with rage, I returned to my bedroom. “Intolerable,” I heard  myself repeating like a parrot that knew no other word. A bath was just  what I had needed. Could I have lain for a long time basking in very  hot water, and then have sponged myself with cold water, I should have  emerged calm and brave; comparatively so, at any rate. I should have  looked less ghastly, and have had less of a headache, and something of  an appetite, when I went down to breakfast. Also, I shouldn’t have been  the very first guest to appear on the scene. There were five or six  round tables, instead of last night’s long table. At the further end  of the room the butler and two other servants were lighting the little  lamps under the hot dishes. I didn’t like to make myself ridiculous by  running away. On the other hand, was it right for me to begin breakfast  all by myself at one of these round tables? I supposed it was. But  I dreaded to be found eating, alone in that vast room, by the first  downcomer. I sat dallying with dry toast and watching the door. It  occurred to me that Braxton might occur at any moment. Should I be able  to ignore him?    ‘Some man and wife--a very handsome couple--were the first to appear.  They nodded and said “good morning” when they noticed me on their way to  the hot dishes. I rose--uncomfortably, guiltily--and sat down again. I  rose again when the wife drifted to my table, followed by the husband  with two steaming plates. She asked me if it wasn’t a heavenly morning,  and I replied with nervous enthusiasm that it was. She then ate kedgeree  in silence. “You just finishing, what?” the husband asked, looking at  my plate. “Oh, no--no--only just beginning,” I assured him, and helped  myself to butter. He then ate kedgeree in silence. He looked like some  splendid bull, and she like some splendid cow, grazing. I envied them  their eupeptic calm. I surmised that ten thousand Braxtons would not  have prevented THEM from sleeping soundly by night and grazing steadily  by day. Perhaps their stolidity infected me a little. Or perhaps what  braced me was the great quantity of strong tea that I consumed. Anyhow  I had begun to feel that if Braxton came in now I shouldn’t blench nor  falter.    ‘Well, I wasn’t put to the test. Plenty of people drifted in, but  Braxton wasn’t one of them. Lady Rodfitten--no, she didn’t drift, she  marched, in; and presently, at an adjacent table, she was drawing a  comparison, in clarion tones, between Jean and Edouard de Reszke. It  seemed to me that her own voice had much in common with Edouard’s. Even  more was it akin to a military band. I found myself beating time to it  with my foot. Decidedly, my spirits had risen. I was in a mood to face  and outface anything. When I rose from the table and made my way to the  door, I walked with something of a swing--to the tune of Lady Rodfitten.    ‘My buoyancy didn’t last long, though. There was no swing in my walk  when, a little later, I passed out on to the spectacular terrace. I had  seen my enemy again, and had beaten a furious retreat. No doubt I should  see him yet again soon--here, perhaps, on this terrace. Two of the  guests were bicycling slowly up and down the long paven expanse, both of  them smiling with pride in the new delicious form of locomotion. There  was a great array of bicycles propped neatly along the balustrade. I  recognised my own among them. I wondered whether Braxton had projected  from Clifford’s Inn an image of his own bicycle. He may have done so;  but I’ve no evidence that he did. I myself was bicycling when next I saw  him; but he, I remember, was on foot.    ‘This was a few minutes later. I was bicycling with dear Lady Rodfitten.  She seemed really to like me. She had come out and accosted me heartily  on the terrace, asking me, because of my sticking-plaster, with whom I  had fought a duel since yesterday. I did not tell her with whom, and  she had already branched off on the subject of duelling in general. She  regretted the extinction of duelling in England, and gave cogent  reasons for her regret. Then she asked me what my next book was to be.  I confided that I was writing a sort of sequel--“Ariel Returns to  Mayfair.” She shook her head, said with her usual soundness that sequels  were very dangerous things, and asked me to tell her “briefly” the lines  along which I was working. I did so. She pointed out two or three weak  points in my scheme. She said she could judge better if I would let  her see my manuscript. She asked me to come and lunch with her next  Friday--“just our two selves”--at Rodfitten House, and to bring my  manuscript with me. Need I say that I walked on air?    ‘“And now,” she said strenuously, “let us take a turn on our bicycles.”   By this time there were a dozen riders on the terrace, all of them  smiling with pride and rapture. We mounted and rode along together. The  terrace ran round two sides of the house, and before we came to the end  of it these words had provisionally marshalled themselves in my mind:                            TO                      ELEANOR               COUNTESS OF RODFITTEN             THIS BOOK WHICH OWES ALL               TO HER WISE COUNSEL            AND UNWEARYING SUPERVISION              IS GRATEFULLY DEDICATED                  BY HER FRIEND                    THE AUTHOR      ‘Smiled to masonically by the passing bicyclists, and smiling  masonically to them in return, I began to feel that the rest of my visit  would run smooth, if only--    ‘“Let’s go a little faster. Let’s race!” said Lady Rodfitten; and we did  so--“just our two selves.” I was on the side nearer to the balustrade,  and it was on that side that Braxton suddenly appeared from nowhere,  solid-looking as a rock, his arms akimbo, less than three yards ahead  of me, so that I swerved involuntarily, sharply, striking broadside the  front wheel of Lady Rodfitten and collapsing with her, and with a crash  of machinery, to the ground.    ‘I wasn’t hurt. She had broken my fall. I wished I was dead. She  was furious. She sat speechless with fury. A crowd had quickly  collected--just as in the case of a street accident. She accused me now  to the crowd. She said I had done it on purpose. She said such terrible  things of me that I think the crowd’s sympathy must have veered towards  me. She was assisted to her feet. I tried to be one of the assistants.  “Don’t let him come near me!” she thundered. I caught sight of Braxton  on the fringe of the crowd, grinning at me. “It was all HIS fault,”   I madly cried, pointing at him. Everybody looked at Mr. Balfour,  just behind whom Braxton was standing. There was a general murmur  of surprise, in which I have no doubt Mr. Balfour joined. He gave a  charming, blank, deprecating smile. “I mean--I can’t explain what I  mean,” I groaned. Lady Rodfitten moved away, refusing support, limping  terribly, towards the house. The crowd followed her, solicitous. I stood  helplessly, desperately, where I was.    ‘I stood an outlaw, a speck on the now empty terrace. Mechanically  I picked up my straw hat, and wheeled the two bent bicycles to the  balustrade. I suppose Mr. Balfour has a charming nature. For he  presently came out again--on purpose, I am sure, to alleviate my misery.  He told me that Lady Rodfitten had suffered no harm. He took me for a  stroll up and down the terrace, talking thoughtfully and enchantingly  about things in general. Then, having done his deed of mercy, this Good  Samaritan went back into the house. My eyes followed him with gratitude;  but I was still bleeding from wounds beyond his skill. I escaped down  into the gardens. I wanted to see no one. Still more did I want to be  seen by no one. I dreaded in every nerve of me my reappearance among  those people. I walked ever faster and faster, to stifle thought; but in  vain. Why hadn’t I simply ridden THROUGH Braxton? I was aware of being  now in the park, among great trees and undulations of wild green ground.  But Nature did not achieve the task that Mr. Balfour had attempted; and  my anguish was unassuaged.    ‘I paused to lean against a tree in the huge avenue that led to the huge  hateful house. I leaned wondering whether the thought of re-entering  that house were the more hateful because I should have to face my  fellow-guests or because I should probably have to face Braxton. A  church bell began ringing somewhere. And anon I was aware of another  sound--a twitter of voices. A consignment of hatted and parasoled ladies  was coming fast adown the avenue. My first impulse was to dodge behind  my tree. But I feared that I had been observed; so that what was left to  me of self-respect compelled me to meet these ladies.    ‘The Duchess was among them. I had seen her from afar at breakfast,  but not since. She carried a prayer-book, which she waved to me as I  approached. I was a disastrous guest, but still a guest, and nothing  could have been prettier than her smile. “Most of my men this week,”   she said, “are Pagans, and all the others have dispatch-boxes to go  through--except the dear old Duke of Mull, who’s a member of the Free  Kirk. You’re Pagan, of course?”    ‘I said--and indeed it was a heart-cry--that I should like very much to  come to church. “If I shan’t be in the way,” I rather abjectly added.  It didn’t strike me that Braxton would try to intercept me. I don’t know  why, but it never occurred to me, as I walked briskly along beside the  Duchess, that I should meet him so far from the house. The church was in  a corner of the park, and the way to it was by a side path that branched  off from the end of the avenue. A little way along, casting its shadow  across the path, was a large oak. It was from behind this tree, when we  came to it, that Braxton sprang suddenly forth and tripped me up with  his foot.    ‘Absurd to be tripped up by the mere semblance of a foot? But remember,  I was walking quickly, and the whole thing happened in a flash of  time. It was inevitable that I should throw out my hands and come down  headlong--just as though the obstacle had been as real as it looked.  Down I came on palms and knee-caps, and up I scrambled, very much hurt  and shaken and apologetic. “POOR Mr. Maltby! REALLY--!” the Duchess  wailed for me in this latest of my mishaps. Some other lady chased my  straw hat, which had bowled far ahead. Two others helped to brush me.  They were all very kind, with a quaver of mirth in their concern for me.  I looked furtively around for Braxton, but he was gone. The palms of my  hands were abraded with gravel. The Duchess said I must on no account  come to church NOW. I was utterly determined to reach that sanctuary. I  marched firmly on with the Duchess. Come what might on the way, I wasn’t  going to be left out here. I was utterly bent on winning at least one  respite.    ‘Well, I reached the little church without further molestation. To be  there seemed almost too good to be true. The organ, just as we entered,  sounded its first notes. The ladies rustled into the front pew. I,  being the one male of the party, sat at the end of the pew, beside the  Duchess. I couldn’t help feeling that my position was a proud one. But I  had gone through too much to take instant pleasure in it, and was beset  by thoughts of what new horror might await me on the way back to  the house. I hoped the Service would not be brief. The swelling and  dwindling strains of the “voluntary” on the small organ were strangely  soothing. I turned to give an almost feudal glance to the simple  villagers in the pews behind, and saw a sight that cowed my soul.    ‘Braxton was coming up the aisle. He came slowly, casting a tourist’s  eye at the stained-glass windows on either side. Walking heavily, yet  with no sound of boots on the pavement, he reached our pew. There,  towering and glowering, he halted, as though demanding that we should  make room for him. A moment later he edged sullenly into the pew.  Instinctively I had sat tight back, drawing my knees aside, in a shudder  of revulsion against contact. But Braxton did not push past me. What he  did was to sit slowly and fully down on me.    ‘No, not down ON me. Down THROUGH me--and around me. What befell me  was not mere ghastly contact with the intangible. It was inclusion,  envelopment, eclipse. What Braxton sat down on was not I, but the seat  of the pew; and what he sat back against was not my face and chest, but  the back of the pew. I didn’t realise this at the moment. All I knew was  a sudden black blotting-out of all things; an infinite and impenetrable  darkness. I dimly conjectured that I was dead. What was wrong with me,  in point of fact, was that my eyes, with the rest of me, were inside  Braxton. You remember what a great hulking fellow Braxton was. I  calculate that as we sat there my eyes were just beneath the roof of his  mouth. Horrible!    ‘Out of the unfathomable depths of that pitch darkness, I could yet hear  the “voluntary” swelling and dwindling, just as before. It was by this  I knew now that I wasn’t dead. And I suppose I must have craned my head  forward, for I had a sudden glimpse of things--a close quick downward  glimpse of a pepper-and-salt waistcoat and of two great hairy hands  clasped across it. Then darkness again. Either I had drawn back my head,  or Braxton had thrust his forward; I don’t know which. “Are you all  right?” the Duchess’ voice whispered, and no doubt my face was ashen.  “Quite,” whispered my voice. But this pathetic monosyllable was the last  gasp of the social instinct in me. Suddenly, as the “voluntary” swelled  to its close, there was a great sharp shuffling noise. The congregation  had risen to its feet, at the entry of choir and vicar. Braxton had  risen, leaving me in daylight. I beheld his towering back. The Duchess,  beside him, glanced round at me. But I could not, dared not, stand up  into that presented back, into that great waiting darkness. I did but  clutch my hat from beneath the seat and hurry distraught down the aisle,  out through the porch, into the open air.    ‘Whither? To what goal? I didn’t reason. I merely fled--like Orestes;  fled like an automaton along the path we had come by. And was followed?  Yes, yes. Glancing back across my shoulder, I saw that brute some  twenty yards behind me, gaining on me. I broke into a sharper run. A few  sickening moments later, he was beside me, scowling down into my face.    ‘I swerved, dodged, doubled on my tracks, but he was always at me. Now  and again, for lack of breath, I halted, and he halted with me. And  then, when I had got my wind, I would start running again, in the insane  hope of escaping him. We came, by what twisting and turning course  I know not, to the great avenue, and as I stood there in an agony of  panting I had a dazed vision of the distant Hall. Really I had quite  forgotten I was staying at the Duke of Hertfordshire’s. But Braxton  hadn’t forgotten. He planted himself in front of me. He stood between me  and the house.    ‘Faint though I was, I could almost have laughed. Good heavens! was THAT  all he wanted: that I shouldn’t go back there? Did he suppose I wanted  to go back there--with HIM? Was I the Duke’s prisoner on parole? What  was there to prevent me from just walking off to the railway station? I  turned to do so.    ‘He accompanied me on my way. I thought that when once I had passed  through the lodge gates he might vanish, satisfied. But no, he didn’t  vanish. It was as though he suspected that if he let me out of his  sight I should sneak back to the house. He arrived with me, this quiet  companion of mine, at the little railway station. Evidently he meant to  see me off. I learned from an elderly and solitary porter that the next  train to London was the 4.3.    ‘Well, Braxton saw me off by the 4.3. I reflected, as I stepped up into  an empty compartment, that it wasn’t yet twenty-four hours ago since I,  or some one like me, had alighted at that station.    ‘The guard blew his whistle; the engine shrieked, and the train jolted  forward and away; but I did not lean out of the window to see the last  of my attentive friend.    ‘Really not twenty-four hours ago? Not twenty-four years?’      Maltby paused in his narrative. ‘Well, well,’ he said, ‘I don’t want you  to think I overrate the ordeal of my visit to Keeb. A man of stronger  nerve than mine, and of greater resourcefulness, might have coped  successfully with Braxton from first to last--might have stayed on till  Monday, making a very favourable impression on every one all the while.  Even as it was, even after my manifold failures and sudden flight, I  don’t say my position was impossible. I only say it seemed so to me. A  man less sensitive than I, and less vain, might have cheered up after  writing a letter of apology to his hostess, and have resumed his normal  existence as though nothing very terrible had happened, after all. I  wrote a few lines to the Duchess that night; but I wrote amidst the  preparations for my departure from England: I crossed the Channel next  morning. Throughout that Sunday afternoon with Braxton at the Keeb  railway station, pacing the desolate platform with him, waiting in  the desolating waiting-room with him, I was numb to regrets, and was  thinking of nothing but the 4.3. On the way to Victoria my brain worked  and my soul wilted. Every incident in my stay at Keeb stood out clear  to me; a dreadful, a hideous pattern. I had done for myself, so far as  THOSE people were concerned. And now that I had sampled THEM, what cared  I for others? “Too low for a hawk, too high for a buzzard.” That homely  old saying seemed to sum me up. And suppose I COULD still take pleasure  in the company of my own old upper-middle class, how would that class  regard me now? Gossip percolates. Little by little, I was sure, the  story of my Keeb fiasco would leak down into the drawing-room of Mrs.  Foster-Dugdale. I felt I could never hold up my head in any company  where anything of that story was known. Are you quite sure you never  heard anything?’    I assured Maltby that all I had known was the great bare fact of his  having stayed at Keeb Hall.    ‘It’s curious,’ he reflected. ‘It’s a fine illustration of the loyalty  of those people to one another. I suppose there was a general agreement  for the Duchess’ sake that nothing should be said about her queer guest.  But even if I had dared hope to be so efficiently hushed up, I couldn’t  have not fled. I wanted to forget. I wanted to leap into some void,  far away from all reminders. I leapt straight from Ryder Street into  Vaule-la-Rochette, a place of which I had once heard that it was  the least frequented seaside-resort in Europe. I leapt leaving no  address--leapt telling my landlord that if a suit-case and a portmanteau  arrived for me he could regard them, them and their contents, as his own  for ever. I daresay the Duchess wrote me a kind little letter, forcing  herself to express a vague hope that I would come again “some other  time.” I daresay Lady Rodfitten did NOT write reminding me of my promise  to lunch on Friday and bring “Ariel Returns to Mayfair” with me. I  left that manuscript at Ryder Street; in my bedroom grate; a shuffle of  ashes. Not that I’d yet given up all thought of writing. But I certainly  wasn’t going to write now about the two things I most needed to forget.  I wasn’t going to write about the British aristocracy, nor about any  kind of supernatural presence.... I did write a novel--my last--while I  was at Vaule. “Mr. and Mrs. Robinson.” Did you ever come across a copy  of it?    I nodded gravely.    ‘Ah; I wasn’t sure,’ said Maltby, ‘whether it was ever published. A  dreary affair, wasn’t it? I knew a great deal about suburban life.  But--well, I suppose one can’t really understand what one doesn’t love,  and one can’t make good fun without real understanding. Besides, what  chance of virtue is there for a book written merely to distract  the author’s mind? I had hoped to be healed by sea and sunshine and  solitude. These things were useless. The labour of “Mr. and Mrs.  Robinson” did help, a little. When I had finished it, I thought I might  as well send it off to my publisher. He had given me a large sum of  money, down, after “Ariel,” for my next book--so large that I was rather  loth to disgorge. In the note I sent with the manuscript, I gave no  address, and asked that the proofs should be read in the office. I  didn’t care whether the thing were published or not. I knew it would be  a dead failure if it were. What mattered one more drop in the foaming  cup of my humiliation? I knew Braxton would grin and gloat. I didn’t  mind even that.’    ‘Oh, well,’ I said, ‘Braxton was in no mood for grinning and gloating.  “The Drones” had already appeared.’    Maltby had never heard of ‘The Drones’--which I myself had remembered  only in the course of his disclosures. I explained to him that it was  Braxton’s second novel, and was by way of being a savage indictment  of the British aristocracy; that it was written in the worst possible  taste, but was so very dull that it fell utterly flat; that Braxton  had forthwith taken, with all of what Maltby had called ‘the passionate  force and intensity of his nature,’ to drink, and had presently gone  under and not re-emerged.    Maltby gave signs of genuine, though not deep, emotion, and cited two  or three of the finest passages from ‘A Faun on the Cotswolds.’ He even  expressed a conviction that ‘The Drones’ must have been misjudged. He  said he blamed himself more than ever for yielding to that bad impulse  at that Soiree.    ‘And yet,’ he mused, ‘and yet, honestly, I can’t find it in my heart  to regret that I did yield. I can only wish that all had turned out as  well, in the end, for Braxton as for me. I wish he could have won out,  as I did, into a great and lasting felicity. For about a year after I  had finished “Mr. and Mrs. Robinson” I wandered from place to place,  trying to kill memory, shunning all places frequented by the English.  At last I found myself in Lucca. Here, if anywhere, I thought, might a  bruised and tormented spirit find gradual peace. I determined to move  out of my hotel into some permanent lodging. Not for felicity, not for  any complete restoration of self-respect, was I hoping; only for peace.  A “mezzano” conducted me to a noble and ancient house, of which, he  told me, the owner was anxious to let the first floor. It was in much  disrepair, but even so seemed to me very cheap. According to the simple  Luccan standard, I am rich. I took that first floor for a year, had it  repaired, and engaged two servants. My “padrona” inhabited the ground  floor. From time to time she allowed me to visit her there. She was  the Contessa Adriano-Rizzoli, the last of her line. She is the Contessa  Adriano-Rizzoli-Maltby. We have been married fifteen years.’    Maltby looked at his watch. He rose and took tenderly from the table  his great bunch of roses. ‘She is a lineal descendant,’ he said, ‘of the  Emperor Hadrian.’            ‘SAVONAROLA’ BROWN      I like to remember that I was the first to call him so, for, though he  always deprecated the nickname, in his heart he was pleased by it, I  know, and encouraged to go on.    Quite apart from its significance, he had reason to welcome it. He had  been unfortunate at the font. His parents, at the time of his birth,  lived in Ladbroke Crescent, XV. They must have been an extraordinarily  unimaginative couple, for they could think of no better name for their  child than Ladbroke. This was all very well for him till he went to  school. But you can fancy the indignation and delight of us boys at  finding among us a newcomer who, on his own confession, had been named  after a Crescent. I don’t know how it is nowadays, but thirty-five years  ago, certainly, schoolboys regarded the possession of ANY Christian name  as rather unmanly. As we all had these encumbrances, we had to wreak our  scorn on any one who was cumbered in a queer fashion. I myself, bearer  of a Christian name adjudged eccentric though brief, had had much to put  up with in my first term. Brown’s arrival, therefore, at the beginning  of my second term, was a good thing for me, and I am afraid I was very  prominent among his persecutors. Trafalgar Brown, Tottenham Court Brown,  Bond Brown--what names did we little brutes NOT cull for him from  the London Directory? Except how miserable we made his life, I do not  remember much about him as he was at that time, and the only important  part of the little else that I do recall is that already he showed  a strong sense for literature. For the majority of us Carthusians,  literature was bounded on the north by Whyte Melville, on the south by  Hawley Smart, on the east by the former, and on the west by the latter.  Little Brown used to read Harrison Ainsworth, Wilkie Collins, and other  writers whom we, had we assayed them, would have dismissed as ‘deep.’ It  has been said by Mr. Arthur Symons that ‘all art is a mode of escape.’  The art of letters did not, however, enable Brown to escape so far from  us as he would have wished. In my third term he did not reappear among  us. His parents had in some sort atoned. Unimaginative though they  were, it seems they could understand a tale of woe laid before them  circumstantially, and had engaged a private tutor for their boy. Fifteen  years elapsed before I saw him again.    This was at the second night of some play. I was dramatic critic for the  Saturday Review, and, weary of meeting the same lot of people over and  over again at first nights, had recently sent a circular to the managers  asking that I might have seats for second nights instead. I found that  there existed as distinct and invariable a lot of second-nighters as of  first-nighters. The second-nighters were less ‘showy’; but then, they  came rather to see than to be seen, and there was an air, that I liked,  of earnestness and hopefulness about them. I used to write a great deal  about the future of the British drama, and they, for their part, used  to think and talk a great deal about it. People who care about books  and pictures find much to interest and please them in the present. It  is only the students of the theatre who always fall back, or rather  forward, on the future. Though second-nighters do come to see, they  remain rather to hope and pray. I should have known anywhere, by the  visionary look in his eyes, that Brown was a confirmed second-nighter.    What surprises me is that I knew he was Brown. It is true that he  had not grown much in those fifteen years: his brow was still  disproportionate to his body, and he looked young to have become  ‘confirmed’ in any habit. But it is also true that not once in the past  ten years, at any rate, had he flitted through my mind and poised on my  conscience.    I hope that I and those other boys had long ago ceased from recurring to  him in nightmares. Cordial though the hand was that I offered him, and  highly civilised my whole demeanour, he seemed afraid that at any moment  I might begin to dance around him, shooting out my lips at him and  calling him Seven-Sisters Brown or something of that kind. It was only  after constant meetings at second nights, and innumerable entr’acte  talks about the future of the drama, that he began to trust me. In  course of time we formed the habit of walking home together as far as  Cumberland Place, at which point our ways diverged. I gathered that he  was still living with his parents, but he did not tell me where, for  they had not, as I learned by reference to the Red Book, moved from  Ladbroke Crescent.    I found his company restful rather than inspiring. His days were  spent in clerkship at one of the smaller Government Offices, his  evenings--except when there was a second night--in reading and writing.  He did not seem to know much, or to wish to know more, about life. Books  and plays, first editions and second nights, were what he cared for. On  matters of religion and ethics he was as little keen as he seemed to be  on human character in the raw; so that (though I had already suspected  him of writing, or meaning to write, a play) my eyebrows did rise when  he told me he meant to write a play about Savonarola.    He made me understand, however, that it was rather the name than the  man that had first attracted him. He said that the name was in itself a  great incentive to blank-verse. He uttered it to me slowly, in a voice  so much deeper than his usual voice, that I nearly laughed. For the  actual bearer of the name he had no hero-worship, and said it was by a  mere accident that he had chosen him as central figure. He had  thought of writing a tragedy about Sardanapalus; but the volume of the  “Encyclopedia Britannica” in which he was going to look up the main  facts about Sardanapalus happened to open at Savonarola. Hence a sudden  and complete peripety in the student’s mind. He told me he had read the  Encyclopedia’s article carefully, and had dipped into one or two of  the books there mentioned as authorities. He seemed almost to wish he  hadn’t. ‘Facts get in one’s way so,’ he complained. ‘History is one  thing, drama is another. Aristotle said drama was more philosophic than  history because it showed us what men WOULD do, not just what they DID.  I think that’s so true, don’t you? I want to show what Savonarola WOULD  have done if--’ He paused.    ‘If what?’    ‘Well, that’s just the point. I haven’t settled that yet. When I’ve  thought of a plot, I shall go straight ahead.’    I said I supposed he intended his tragedy rather for the study than for  the stage. This seemed to hurt him. I told him that what I meant was  that managers always shied at anything without ‘a strong feminine  interest.’ This seemed to worry him. I advised him not to think about  managers. He promised that he would think only about Savonarola.    I know now that this promise was not exactly kept by him; and he may  have felt slightly awkward when, some weeks later, he told me he had  begun the play. ‘I’ve hit on an initial idea,’ he said, ‘and that’s  enough to start with. I gave up my notion of inventing a plot in  advance. I thought it would be a mistake. I don’t want puppets on wires.  I want Savonarola to work out his destiny in his own way. Now that I  have the initial idea, what I’ve got to do is to make Savonarola LIVE.  I hope I shall be able to do this. Once he’s alive, I shan’t interfere  with him. I shall just watch him. Won’t it be interesting? He isn’t  alive yet. But there’s plenty of time. You see, he doesn’t come on at  the rise of the curtain. A Friar and a Sacristan come on and talk about  him. By the time they’ve finished, perhaps he’ll be alive. But they  won’t have finished yet. Not that they’re going to say very much. But I  write slowly.’    I remember the mild thrill I had when, one evening, he took me aside and  said in an undertone, ‘Savonarola has come on. Alive!’ For me the MS.  hereinafter printed has an interest that for you it cannot have, so  a-bristle am I with memories of the meetings I had with its author  throughout the nine years he took over it. He never saw me without  reporting progress, or lack of progress. Just what was going on, or  standing still, he did not divulge. After the entry of Savonarola,  he never told me what characters were appearing. ‘All sorts of people  appear,’ he would say rather helplessly. ‘They insist. I can’t prevent  them.’ I used to say it must be great fun to be a creative artist; but  at this he always shook his head: ‘I don’t create. THEY do. Savonarola  especially, of course. I just look on and record. I never know what’s  going to happen next.’ He had the advantage of me in knowing at any rate  what had happened last. But whenever I pled for a glimpse he would again  shake his head:    ‘The thing MUST be judged as a whole. Wait till I’ve come to the end of  the Fifth Act.’    So impatient did I become that, as the years went by, I used rather to  resent his presence at second nights. I felt he ought to be at his  desk. His, I used to tell him, was the only drama whose future ought  to concern him now. And in point of fact he had, I think, lost the true  spirit of the second-nighter, and came rather to be seen than to see.  He liked the knowledge that here and there in the auditorium, when he  entered it, some one would be saying ‘Who is that?’ and receiving the  answer ‘Oh, don’t you know? That’s “Savonarola” Brown.’ This sort of  thing, however, did not make him cease to be the modest, unaffected  fellow I had known. He always listened to the advice I used to offer  him, though inwardly he must have chafed at it. Myself a fidgety and  uninspired person, unable to begin a piece of writing before I know just  how it shall end, I had always been afraid that sooner or later Brown  would take some turning that led nowhither--would lose himself and come  to grief. This fear crept into my gladness when, one evening in the  spring of 1909, he told me he had finished the Fourth Act. Would he win  out safely through the Fifth?    He himself was looking rather glum; and, as we walked away from the  theatre, I said to him, ‘I suppose you feel rather like Thackeray when  he’d “killed the Colonel”: you’ve got to kill the Monk.’    ‘Not quite that,’ he answered. ‘But of course he’ll die very soon now. A  couple of years or so. And it does seem rather sad. It’s not merely that  he’s so full of life. He has been becoming much more HUMAN lately. At  first I only respected him. Now I have a real affection for him.’    This was an interesting glimpse at last, but I turned from it to my  besetting fear.    ‘Haven’t you,’ I asked, ‘any notion of HOW he is to die?’    Brown shook his head.    ‘But in a tragedy,’ I insisted, ‘the catastrophe MUST be led up to,  step by step. My dear Brown, the end of the hero MUST be logical and  rational.’    ‘I don’t see that,’ he said, as we crossed Piccadilly Circus. ‘In actual  life it isn’t so. What is there to prevent a motor-omnibus from knocking  me over and killing me at this moment?’    At that moment, by what has always seemed to me the strangest of  coincidences, and just the sort of thing that playwrights ought to  avoid, a motor-omnibus knocked Brown over and killed him.    He had, as I afterwards learned, made a will in which he appointed me  his literary executor. Thus passed into my hands the unfinished play by  whose name he had become known to so many people.      I hate to say that I was disappointed in it, but I had better confess  quite frankly that, on the whole, I was. Had Brown written it quickly  and read it to me soon after our first talk about it, it might in some  ways have exceeded my hopes. But he had become for me, by reason of that  quiet and unhasting devotion to his work while the years came and went,  a sort of hero; and the very mystery involving just what he was about  had addicted me to those ideas of magnificence which the unknown is said  always to foster.    Even so, however, I am not blind to the great merits of the play as it  stands. It is well that the writer of poetic drama should be a dramatist  and a poet. Here is a play that abounds in striking situations, and I  have searched it vainly for one line that does not scan. What I nowhere  feel is that I have not elsewhere been thrilled or lulled by the same  kind of thing. I do not go so far as to say that Brown inherited his  parents’ deplorable lack of imagination. But I do wish he had been less  sensitive than he was to impressions, or else had seen and read fewer  poetic dramas ancient and modern. Remembering that visionary look in  his eyes, remembering that he was as displeased as I by the work of all  living playwrights, and as dissatisfied with the great efforts of the  Elizabethans, I wonder that he was not more immune from influences.    Also, I cannot but wish still that he had faltered in his decision  to make no scenario. There is much to be said for the theory that a  dramatist should first vitalise his characters and then leave them  unfettered; but I do feel that Brown’s misused the confidence he reposed  in them. The labour of so many years has somewhat the air of being  a mere improvisation. Savonarola himself, after the First Act or so,  strikes me as utterly inconsistent. It may be that he is just complex,  like Hamlet. He does in the Fourth Act show traces of that Prince. I  suppose this is why he struck Brown as having become ‘more human.’ To me  he seems merely a poorer creature.    But enough of these reservations. In my anxiety for poor Brown’s sake  that you should not be disappointed, perhaps I have been carrying  tactfulness too far and prejudicing you against that for which I  specially want your favour. Here, without more ado, is          SAVONAROLA    A TRAGEDY    By L. Brown        ACT I      SCENE:    A Room in the Monastery of San Marco, Florence.    TIME: 1490, A.D.  A summer morning.      Enter the SACRISTAN and a FRIAR.      SACR.    Savonarola looks more grim to-day    Than ever.  Should I speak my mind, I’d say    That he was fashioning some new great scourge    To flay the backs of men.      FRI.                               ‘Tis even so.    Brother Filippo saw him stand last night    In solitary vigil till the dawn    Lept o’er the Arno, and his face was such    As men may wear in Purgatory--nay,    E’en in the inmost core of Hell’s own fires.      SACR.    I often wonder if some woman’s face,    Seen at some rout in his old worldling days,    Haunts him e’en now, e’en here, and urges him    To fierier fury ‘gainst the Florentines.      FRI.    Savonarola love-sick!  Ha, ha, ha!    Love-sick?  He, love-sick?  ‘Tis a goodly jest!    The CONfirm’d misogyn a ladies’ man!    Thou must have eaten of some strange red herb    That takes the reason captive.  I will swear    Savonarola never yet hath seen    A woman but he spurn’d her.  Hist!  He comes.      [Enter SAVONAROLA, rapt in thought.]      Give thee good morrow, Brother.      SACR.                                     And therewith    A multitude of morrows equal-good    Till thou, by Heaven’s grace, hast wrought the work    Nearest thine heart.      SAV.                          I thank thee, Brother, yet    I thank thee not, for that my thankfulness    (An such there be) gives thanks to Heaven alone.      FRI. [To SACR.]    ‘Tis a right answer he hath given thee.    Had Sav’narola spoken less than thus,    Methinks me, the less Sav’narola he.    As when the snow lies on yon Apennines,    White as the hem of Mary Mother’s robe,    And insusceptible to the sun’s rays,    Being harder to the touch than temper’d steel,    E’en so this great gaunt monk white-visaged    Upstands to Heaven and to Heav’n devotes    The scarped thoughts that crown the upper slopes    Of his abrupt and AUStere nature.      SACR.                                       Aye.      [Enter LUCREZIA BORGIA, ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI, and LEONARDO     DA VINCI.  LUC. is thickly veiled.]      ST. FRAN.    This is the place.      LUC. [Pointing at SAV.]                        And this the man! [Aside.] And I--    By the hot blood that courses i’ my veins    I swear it ineluctably--the woman!      SAV.    Who is this wanton?    [LUC. throws back her hood, revealing her face.  SAV. starts back,    gazing at her.]      ST. FRAN.                         Hush, Sir!  ‘Tis my little sister    The poisoner, right well-belov’d by all    Whom she as yet hath spared.  Hither she came    Mounted upon another little sister of mine--    A mare, caparison’d in goodly wise.    She--I refer now to Lucrezia--    Desireth to have word of thee anent    Some matter that befrets her.      SAV. [To LUC.]                                   Hence!  Begone!    Savonarola will not tempted be    By face of woman e’en tho’ ‘t be, tho’ ‘tis,    Surpassing fair.  All hope abandon therefore.    I charge thee: Vade retro, Satanas.      LEONARDO    Sirrah, thou speakst in haste, as is the way    Of monkish men.  The beauty of Lucrezia    Commends, not discommends, her to the eyes    Of keener thinkers than I take thee for.    I am an artist and an engineer,    Giv’n o’er to subtile dreams of what shall be    On this our planet.  I foresee a day    When men shall skim the earth i’ certain chairs    Not drawn by horses but sped on by oil    Or other matter, and shall thread the sky    Birdlike.      LUC.               It may be as thou sayest, friend,    Or may be not. [To SAV.] As touching this our errand,    I crave of thee, Sir Monk, an audience    Instanter.      FRI.                Lo!  Here Alighieri comes.    I had methought me he was still at Parma.      [Enter DANTE.]      ST. FRAN. [To DAN.]    How fares my little sister Beatrice?      DAN.    She died, alack, last sennight.      ST. FRAN.                                     Did she so?    If the condolences of men avail    Thee aught, take mine.      DAN.                            They are of no avail.      SAV. [To LUC.]    I do refuse thee audience.      LUC.                                Then why    Didst thou not say so promptly when I ask’d it?      SAV.    Full well thou knowst that I was interrupted    By Alighieri’s entry.    [Noise without.  Enter Guelfs and Ghibellines fighting.]                           What is this?      LUC.    I did not think that in this cloister’d spot    There would be so much doing.  I had look’d    To find Savonarola all alone    And tempt him in his uneventful cell.    Instead o’ which--Spurn’d am I?  I am I.    There was a time, Sir, look to ‘t!  O damnation!    What is ‘t?  Anon then!  These my toys, my gauds,    That in the cradle--aye, ‘t my mother’s breast--    I puled and lisped at,--‘Tis impossible,    Tho’, faith, ‘tis not so, forasmuch as ‘tis.    And I a daughter of the Borgias!--    Or so they told me.  Liars!  Flatterers!    Currying lick-spoons!  Where’s the Hell of ‘t then?    ‘Tis time that I were going.  Farewell, Monk,    But I’ll avenge me ere the sun has sunk.    [Exeunt LUC., ST. FRAN., and LEONARDO, followed by DAN.  SAV., having    watched LUC. out of sight, sinks to his knees, sobbing.  FRI. and SACR.    watch him in amazement.  Guelfs and Ghibellines continue fighting as    the Curtain falls.]        ACT II      TIME: Afternoon of same day.    SCENE:    Lucrezia’s Laboratory.  Retorts, test-tubes, etc.  On small    Renaissance table, up c., is a great poison-bowl, the contents of    which are being stirred by the FIRST APPRENTICE.  The SECOND APPRENTICE    stands by, watching him.      SECOND APP.    For whom is the brew destin’d?      FIRST APP.                                    I know not.    Lady Lucrezia did but lay on me    Injunctions as regards the making of ‘t,    The which I have obey’d.  It is compounded    Of a malignant and a deadly weed    Found not save in the Gulf of Spezia,    And one small phial of ‘t, I am advis’d,    Were more than ‘nough to slay a regiment    Of Messer Malatesta’s condottieri    In all their armour.      SECOND APP.                          I can well believe it.    Mark how the purple bubbles froth upon    The evil surface of its nether slime!      [Enter LUC.]      LUC. [To FIRST APP.]    Is ‘t done, Sir Sluggard?      FIRST APP.                               Madam, to a turn.      LUC.    Had it not been so, I with mine own hand    Would have outpour’d it down thy gullet, knave.    See, here’s a ring of cunningly-wrought gold      That I, on a dark night, did purchase from    A goldsmith on the Ponte Vecchio.    Small was his shop, and hoar of visage he.    I did bemark that from the ceiling’s beams    Spiders had spun their webs for many a year,    The which hung erst like swathes of gossamer    Seen in the shadows of a fairy glade,    But now most woefully were weighted o’er    With gather’d dust.  Look well now at the ring!    Touch’d here, behold, it opes a cavity    Capacious of three drops of yon fell stuff.    Dost heed?  Whoso then puts it on his finger    Dies, and his soul is from his body rapt    To Hell or Heaven as the case may be.    Take thou this toy and pour the three drops in.      [Hands ring to FIRST APP. and comes down c.]      So, Sav’narola, thou shalt learn that I    Utter no threats but I do make them good.    Ere this day’s sun hath wester’d from the view    Thou art to preach from out the Loggia    Dei Lanzi to the cits in the Piazza.    I, thy Lucrezia, will be upon the steps    To offer thee with phrases seeming-fair    That which shall seal thine eloquence for ever.    O mighty lips that held the world in spell    But would not meet these little lips of mine    In the sweet way that lovers use--O thin,    Cold, tight-drawn, bloodless lips, which natheless I    Deem of all lips the most magnifical    In this our city--      [Enter the Borgias’ FOOL.]                          Well, Fool, what’s thy latest?      FOOL    Aristotle’s or Zeno’s, Lady--‘tis neither latest nor last.  For,    marry, if the cobbler stuck to his last, then were his latest his last    in rebus ambulantibus.  Argal, I stick at nothing but cobble-stones,    which, by the same token, are stuck to the road by men’s fingers.      LUC.    How many crows may nest in a grocer’s jerkin?      FOOL    A full dozen at cock-crow, and something less under the dog-star, by    reason of the dew, which lies heavy on men taken by the scurvy.      LUC. [To FIRST APP.]    Methinks the Fool is a fool.      FOOL    And therefore, by auricular deduction, am I own twin to the Lady    Lucrezia!      [Sings.]      When pears hang green on the garden wall      With a nid, and a nod, and a niddy-niddy-o    Then prank you, lads and lasses all,        With a yea and a nay and a niddy-o.      But when the thrush flies out o’ the frost      With a nid, [etc.]    ‘Tis time for loons to count the cost,        With a yea [etc.]      [Enter the PORTER.]      PORTER    O my dear Mistress, there is one below    Demanding to have instant word of thee.    I told him that your Ladyship was not    At home.  Vain perjury!  He would not take    Nay for an answer.      LUC.                        Ah?  What manner of man    Is he?      PORTER            A personage the like of whom    Is wholly unfamiliar to my gaze.    Cowl’d is he, but I saw his great eyes glare    From their deep sockets in such wise as leopards    Glare from their caverns, crouching ere they spring    On their reluctant prey.      LUC.                              And what name gave he?      PORTER [After a pause.]    Something-arola.      LUC.                      Savon-? [PORTER nods.] Show him up.  [Exit PORTER.]      FOOL    If he be right astronomically, Mistress, then is he the greater dunce    in respect of true learning, the which goes by the globe.  Argal,    ‘twere better he widened his wind-pipe.      [Sings.]    Fly home, sweet self,    Nothing’s for weeping,    Hemp was not made    For lovers’ keeping, Lovers’ keeping,    Cheerly, cheerly, fly away.    Hew no more wood    While ash is glowing,    The longest grass    Is lovers’ mowing,    Lovers’ mowing,    Cheerly, [etc.]      [Re-enter PORTER, followed by SAV.  Exeunt PORTER, FOOL, and FIRST and    SECOND APPS.]      SAV.    I am no more a monk, I am a man    O’ the world.    [Throws off cowl and frock, and stands forth in the costume of a    Renaissance nobleman.  LUCREZIA looks him up and down.]      LUC.                   Thou cutst a sorry figure.      SAV.                                               That    Is neither here nor there.  I love you, Madam.      LUC.    And this, methinks, is neither there nor here,    For that my love of thee hath vanished,    Seeing thee thus beprankt.  Go pad thy calves!    Thus mightst thou, just conceivably, with luck,    Capture the fancy of some serving-wench.      SAV.    And this is all thou hast to say to me?      LUC.    It is.      SAV.            I am dismiss’d?      LUC.                             Thou art.      SAV.                                        ‘Tis well.    [Resumes frock and cowl.]    Savonarola is himself once more.      LUC.    And all my love for him returns to me    A thousandfold!      SAV.                     Too late!  My pride of manhood    Is wounded irremediably.  I’ll    To the Piazza, where my flock awaits me.    Thus do we see that men make great mistakes    But may amend them when the conscience wakes.    [Exit.]      LUC.    I’m half avenged now, but only half:    ‘Tis with the ring I’ll have the final laugh!    Tho’ love be sweet, revenge is sweeter far.    To the Piazza!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, har!    [Seizes ring, and exit.  Through open door are heard, as the Curtain    falls, sounds of a terrific hubbub in the Piazza.]        ACT III      SCENE:    The Piazza.    TIME: A few minutes anterior to close of preceding Act.      The Piazza is filled from end to end with a vast seething crowd that    is drawn entirely from the lower orders.  There is a sprinkling of    wild-eyed and dishevelled women in it.  The men are lantern-jawed,    with several days’ growth of beard.  Most of them carry rude weapons--    staves, bill-hooks, crow-bars, and the like--and are in as excited a    condition as the women.  Some of them are bare-headed, others affect a    kind of Phrygian cap.  Cobblers predominate.      Enter LORENZO DE MEDICI and COSIMO DE MEDICI.  They wear cloaks of scarlet    brocade, and, to avoid notice, hold masks to their faces.      COS.    What purpose doth the foul and greasy plebs    Ensue to-day here?      LOR.                        I nor know nor care.      COS.    How thrall’d thou art to the philosophy    Of Epicurus!  Naught that’s human I    Deem alien from myself. [To a COBBLER.] Make answer, fellow!    What empty hope hath drawn thee by a thread    Forth from the OBscene hovel where thou starvest?      COB.    No empty hope, your Honour, but the full    Assurance that to-day, as yesterday,    Savonarola will let loose his thunder    Against the vices of the idle rich    And from the brimming cornucopia    Of his immense vocabulary pour    Scorn on the lamentable heresies    Of the New Learning and on all the art    Later than Giotto.      COS.                        Mark how absolute    The knave is!      LOR.                   Then are parrots rational    When they regurgitate the thing they hear!    This fool is but an unit of the crowd,    And crowds are senseless as the vasty deep    That sinks or surges as the moon dictates.    I know these crowds, and know that any man    That hath a glib tongue and a rolling eye    Can as he willeth with them.    [Removes his mask and mounts steps of Loggia.]                                  Citizens!    [Prolonged yells and groans from the crowd.]    Yes, I am he, I am that same Lorenzo    Whom you have nicknamed the Magnificent.    [Further terrific yells, shakings of fists, brandishings of bill-    hooks, insistent cries of ‘Death to Lorenzo!’ ‘Down with the    Magnificent!’ Cobblers on fringe of crowd, down c., exhibit especially    all the symptoms of epilepsy, whooping-cough, and other ailments.]    You love not me.    [The crowd makes an ugly rush.  LOR. appears likely to be dragged down    and torn limb from limb, but raises one hand in nick of time, and    continues:]                      Yet I deserve your love.    [The yells are now variegated with dubious murmurs.  A cobbler down c.    thrusts his face feverishly in the face of another and repeats, in a    hoarse interrogative whisper, ‘Deserves our love?’]    Not for the sundry boons I have bestow’d    And benefactions I have lavished    Upon Firenze, City of the Flowers,    But for the love that in this rugged breast    I bear you.    [The yells have now died away, and there is a sharp fall in dubious    murmurs.  The cobbler down c. says, in an ear-piercing whisper, ‘The    love he bears us,’ drops his lower jaw, nods his head repeatedly, and    awaits in an intolerable state of suspense the orator’s next words.]                 I am not a blameless man,    [Some dubious murmurs.]    Yet for that I have lov’d you passing much,    Shall some things be forgiven me.    [Noises of cordial assent.]                                       There dwells    In this our city, known unto you all,    A man more virtuous than I am, and    A thousand times more intellectual;    Yet envy not I him, for--shall I name him?--    He loves not you.  His name? I will not cut    Your hearts by speaking it.  Here let it stay    On tip o’ tongue.    [Insistent clamour.]                       Then steel you to the shock!--    Savonarola.    [For a moment or so the crowd reels silently under the shock.  Cobbler    down c. is the first to recover himself and cry ‘Death to Savonarola!’    The cry instantly becomes general.  LOR. holds up his hand and    gradually imposes silence.]                 His twin bug-bears are    Yourselves and that New Learning which I hold    Less dear than only you.    [Profound sensation.  Everybody whispers ‘Than only you’ to everybody    else.  A woman near steps of Loggia attempts to kiss hem of LOR.’s    garment.]                              Would you but con    With me the old philosophers of Hellas,    Her fervent bards and calm historians,    You would arise and say ‘We will not hear    Another word against them!’    [The crowd already says this, repeatedly, with great emphasis.]                                 Take the Dialogues    Of Plato, for example.  You will find    A spirit far more truly Christian    In them than in the ravings of the sour-soul’d    Savonarola.    [Prolonged cries of ‘Death to the Sour-Souled Savonarola!’  Several    cobblers detach themselves from the crowd and rush away to read the    Platonic Dialogues.  Enter SAVONAROLA.  The crowd, as he makes his way    through it, gives up all further control of its feelings, and makes a    noise for which even the best zoologists might not find a good    comparison.  The staves and bill-hooks wave like twigs in a storm.    One would say that SAV. must have died a thousand deaths already.  He    is, however, unharmed and unruffled as he reaches the upper step of    the Loggia.  LOR. meanwhile has rejoined COS. in the Piazza.]      SAV.                Pax vobiscum, brothers!    [This does but exacerbate the crowd’s frenzy.]      VOICE OF A COBBLER    Hear his false lips cry Peace when there is no    Peace!      SAV.            Are not you ashamed, O Florentines,    [Renewed yells, but also some symptoms of manly shame.]    That hearken’d to Lorenzo and now reel    Inebriate with the exuberance    Of his verbosity?    [The crowd makes an obvious effort to pull itself together.]                       A man can fool    Some of the people all the time, and can    Fool all the people sometimes, but he cannot    Fool ALL the people ALL the time.    [Loud cheers.  Several cobblers clap one another on the back.  Cries    of ‘Death to Lorenzo!’  The meeting is now well in hand.]                                       To-day    I must adopt a somewhat novel course    In dealing with the awful wickedness    At present noticeable in this city.    I do so with reluctance.  Hitherto    I have avoided personalities.    But now my sense of duty forces me    To a departure from my custom of    Naming no names.  One name I must and shall    Name.    [All eyes are turned on LOR., who smiles uncomfortably.]           No, I do not mean Lorenzo.  He    Is ‘neath contempt.    [Loud and prolonged laughter, accompanied with hideous grimaces at LOR.    Exeunt LOR. and COS.]                         I name a woman’s name,    [The women in the crowd eye one another suspiciously.]    A name known to you all--four-syllabled,    Beginning with an L.    [Pause.  Enter hurriedly LUC., carrying the ring.  She stands,    unobserved by any one, on outskirt of crowd.  SAV. utters the name:]                          Lucrezia!      LUC. [With equal intensity.]    Savonarola!    [SAV. starts violently and stares in direction of her voice.]                 Yes, I come, I come!    [Forces her way to steps of Loggia.  The crowd is much bewildered, and    the cries of ‘Death to Lucrezia Borgia!’ are few and sporadic.]    Why didst thou call me?    [SAV. looks somewhat embarrassed.]                             What is thy distress?    I see it all!  The sanguinary mob    Clusters to rend thee!  As the antler’d stag,    With fine eyes glazed from the too-long chase,    Turns to defy the foam-fleck’d pack, and thinks,    In his last moment, of some graceful hind    Seen once afar upon a mountain-top,    E’en so, Savonarola, didst thou think,    In thy most dire extremity, of me.    And here I am!  Courage!  The horrid hounds    Droop tail at sight of me and fawn away    Innocuous.    [The crowd does indeed seem to have fallen completely under the sway    of LUC.’s magnetism, and is evidently convinced that it had been about    to make an end of the monk.]                Take thou, and wear henceforth,    As a sure talisman ‘gainst future perils,    This little, little ring.    [SAV. makes awkward gesture of refusal.  Angry murmurs from the crowd.    Cries of ‘Take thou the ring!’ ‘Churl!’ ‘Put it on!’ etc.    Enter the Borgias’ FOOL and stands unnoticed on fringe of crowd.]                               I hoped you ‘ld like it--    Neat but not gaudy.

6,The Magic Skinr,"her, unlaced her sandals and drew them off,  while her mistress lay carelessly back on her cushioned armchair beside  the fire, yawned, and scratched her head. Every movement was perfectly  natural; there was nothing whatever to indicate the secret sufferings or  emotions with which I had credited her.    “‘George must be in love!’ she remarked. ‘I shall dismiss him. He has  drawn the curtains again to-night. What does he mean by it?’    “All the blood in my veins rushed to my heart at this observation, but  no more was said about curtains.    “‘Life is very empty,’ the countess went on. ‘Ah! be careful not to  scratch me as you did yesterday. Just look here, I still have the marks  of your nails about me,’ and she held out a silken knee. She thrust her  bare feet into velvet slippers bound with swan’s-down, and unfastened  her dress, while Justine prepared to comb her hair.    “‘You ought to marry, madame, and have children.’    “‘Children!’ she cried; ‘it wants no more than that to finish me at  once; and a husband! What man is there to whom I could----? Was my hair  well arranged to-night?’    “‘Not particularly.’    “‘You are a fool!’    “‘That way of crimping your hair too much is the least becoming way  possible for you. Large, smooth curls suit you a great deal better.’    “‘Really?’    “‘Yes, really, madame; that wavy style only looks nice in fair hair.’    “‘Marriage? never, never! Marriage is a commercial arrangement, for  which I was never made.’    “What a disheartening scene for a lover! Here was a lonely woman,  without friends or kin, without the religion of love, without faith in  any affection. Yet however slightly she might feel the need to pour  out her heart, a craving that every human being feels, it could only  be satisfied by gossiping with her maid, by trivial and indifferent  talk.... I grieved for her.    “Justine unlaced her. I watched her carefully when she was at last  unveiled. Her maidenly form, in its rose-tinged whiteness, was visible  through her shift in the taper light, as dazzling as some silver statue  behind its gauze covering. No, there was no defect that need shrink from  the stolen glances of love. Alas, a fair form will overcome the stoutest  resolutions!    “The maid lighted the taper in the alabaster sconce that hung before  the bed, while her mistress sat thoughtful and silent before the fire.  Justine went for a warming-pan, turned down the bed, and helped to lay  her mistress in it; then, after some further time spent in punctiliously  rendering various services that showed how seriously Foedora respected  herself, her maid left her. The countess turned to and fro several  times, and sighed; she was ill at ease; faint, just perceptible sounds,  like sighs of impatience, escaped from her lips. She reached out a hand  to the table, and took a flask from it, from which she shook four or  five drops of some brown liquid into some milk before taking it; again  there followed some painful sighs, and the exclamation, ‘_Mon Dieu_!’    “The cry, and the tone in which it was uttered, wrung my heart. By  degrees she lay motionless. This frightened me; but very soon I heard  a sleeper’s heavy, regular breathing. I drew the rustling silk curtains  apart, left my post, went to the foot of the bed, and gazed at her with  feelings that I cannot define. She was so enchanting as she lay like a  child, with her arm above her head; but the sweetness of the fair,  quiet visage, surrounded by the lace, only irritated me. I had not been  prepared for the torture to which I was compelled to submit.    “‘_Mon Dieu_!’ that scrap of a thought which I understood not, but must  even take as my sole light, had suddenly modified my opinion of Foedora.  Trite or profoundly significant, frivolous or of deep import, the words  might be construed as expressive of either pleasure or pain, of physical  or of mental suffering. Was it a prayer or a malediction, a forecast or  a memory, a fear or a regret? A whole life lay in that utterance, a life  of wealth or of penury; perhaps it contained a crime!    “The mystery that lurked beneath this fair semblance of womanhood grew  afresh; there were so many ways of explaining Foedora, that she became  inexplicable. A sort of language seemed to flow from between her lips.  I put thoughts and feelings into the accidents of her breathing, whether  weak or regular, gentle, or labored. I shared her dreams; I would  fain have divined her secrets by reading them through her slumber. I  hesitated among contradictory opinions and decisions without number.  I could not deny my heart to the woman I saw before me, with the calm,  pure beauty in her face. I resolved to make one more effort. If I told  her the story of my life, my love, my sacrifices, might I not awaken  pity in her or draw a tear from her who never wept?    “As I set all my hopes on this last experiment, the sounds in the  streets showed that day was at hand. For a moment’s space I pictured  Foedora waking to find herself in my arms. I could have stolen softly  to her side and slipped them about her in a close embrace. Resolved  to resist the cruel tyranny of this thought, I hurried into the salon,  heedless of any sounds I might make; but, luckily, I came upon a secret  door leading to a little staircase. As I expected, the key was in the  lock; I slammed the door, went boldly out into the court, and gained  the street in three bounds, without looking round to see whether I was  observed.    “A dramatist was to read a comedy at the countess’ house in two days’  time; I went thither, intending to outstay the others, so as to make a  rather singular request to her; I meant to ask her to keep the following  evening for me alone, and to deny herself to other comers; but when I  found myself alone with her, my courage failed. Every tick of the clock  alarmed me. It wanted only a quarter of an hour of midnight.    “‘If I do not speak,’ I thought to myself, ‘I must smash my head against  the corner of the mantelpiece.’    “I gave myself three minutes’ grace; the three minutes went by, and  I did not smash my head upon the marble; my heart grew heavy, like a  sponge with water.    “‘You are exceedingly amusing,’ said she.    “‘Ah, madame, if you could but understand me!’ I answered.    “‘What is the matter with you?’ she asked. ‘You are turning pale.’    “‘I am hesitating to ask a favor of you.’    “Her gesture revived my courage. I asked her to make the appointment  with me.    “‘Willingly,’ she answered’ ‘but why will you not speak to me now?’    “‘To be candid with you, I ought to explain the full scope of your  promise: I want to spend this evening by your side, as if we were  brother and sister. Have no fear; I am aware of your antipathies; you  must have divined me sufficiently to feel sure that I should wish you  to do nothing that could be displeasing to you; presumption, moreover,  would not thus approach you. You have been a friend to me, you have  shown me kindness and great indulgence; know, therefore, that to-morrow  I must bid you farewell.--Do not take back your word,’ I exclaimed,  seeing her about to speak, and I went away.    “At eight o’clock one evening towards the end of May, Foedora and I were  alone together in her gothic boudoir. I feared no longer; I was secure  of happiness. My mistress should be mine, or I would seek a refuge in  death. I had condemned my faint-hearted love, and a man who acknowledges  his weakness is strong indeed.    “The countess, in her blue cashmere gown, was reclining on a sofa, with  her feet on a cushion. She wore an Oriental turban such as painters  assign to early Hebrews; its strangeness added an indescribable  coquettish grace to her attractions. A transitory charm seemed to have  laid its spell on her face; it might have furnished the argument that  at every instant we become new and unparalleled beings, without any  resemblance to the _us_ of the future or of the past. I had never yet  seen her so radiant.    “‘Do you know that you have piqued my curiosity?’ she said, laughing.    “‘I will not disappoint it,’ I said quietly, as I seated myself near  to her and took the hand that she surrendered to me. ‘You have a very  beautiful voice!’    “‘You have never heard me sing!’ she exclaimed, starting involuntarily  with surprise.    “‘I will prove that it is quite otherwise, whenever it is necessary. Is  your delightful singing still to remain a mystery? Have no fear, I do  not wish to penetrate it.’    “We spent about an hour in familiar talk. While I adopted the attitude  and manner of a man to whom Foedora must refuse nothing, I showed her  all a lover’s deference. Acting in this way, I received a favor--I was  allowed to kiss her hand. She daintily drew off the glove, and my whole  soul was dissolved and poured forth in that kiss. I was steeped in the  bliss of an illusion in which I tried to believe.    “Foedora lent herself most unexpectedly to my caress and my flatteries.  Do not accuse me of faint-heartedness; if I had gone a step beyond these  fraternal compliments, the claws would have been out of the sheath and  into me. We remained perfectly silent for nearly ten minutes. I was  admiring her, investing her with the charms she had not. She was mine  just then, and mine only,--this enchanting being was mine, as was  permissible, in my imagination; my longing wrapped her round and  held her close; in my soul I wedded her. The countess was subdued and  fascinated by my magnetic influence. Ever since I have regretted that  this subjugation was not absolute; but just then I yearned for her soul,  her heart alone, and for nothing else. I longed for an ideal and perfect  happiness, a fair illusion that cannot last for very long. At last I  spoke, feeling that the last hours of my frenzy were at hand.    “‘Hear me, madame. I love you, and you know it; I have said so a hundred  times; you must have understood me. I would not take upon me the airs  of a coxcomb, nor would I flatter you, nor urge myself upon you like a  fool; I would not owe your love to such arts as these! so I have been  misunderstood. What sufferings have I not endured for your sake! For  these, however, you were not to blame; but in a few minutes you shall  decide for yourself. There are two kinds of poverty, madame. One kind  openly walks the street in rags, an unconscious imitator of Diogenes,  on a scanty diet, reducing life to its simplest terms; he is happier,  maybe, than the rich; he has fewer cares at any rate, and accepts such  portions of the world as stronger spirits refuse. Then there is poverty  in splendor, a Spanish pauper, concealing the life of a beggar by his  title, his bravery, and his pride; poverty that wears a white waistcoat  and yellow kid gloves, a beggar with a carriage, whose whole career will  be wrecked for lack of a halfpenny. Poverty of the first kind belongs to  the populace; the second kind is that of blacklegs, of kings, and of men  of talent. I am neither a man of the people, nor a king, nor a swindler;  possibly I have no talent either, I am an exception. With the name I  bear I must die sooner than beg. Set your mind at rest, madame,’ I  said; ‘to-day I have abundance, I possess sufficient of the clay for my  needs’; for the hard look passed over her face which we wear whenever a  well-dressed beggar takes us by surprise. ‘Do you remember the day  when you wished to go to the Gymnase without me, never believing that I  should be there?’ I went on.    “She nodded.    “‘I had laid out my last five-franc piece that I might see you  there.--Do you recollect our walk in the Jardin des Plantes? The hire of  your cab took everything I had.’    “I told her about my sacrifices, and described the life I led; heated  not with wine, as I am to-day, but by the generous enthusiasm of my  heart, my passion overflowed in burning words; I have forgotten how the  feelings within me blazed forth; neither memory nor skill of mine  could possibly reproduce it. It was no colorless chronicle of blighted  affections; my love was strengthened by fair hopes; and such words came  to me, by love’s inspiration, that each had power to set forth a whole  life--like echoes of the cries of a soul in torment. In such tones the  last prayers ascend from dying men on the battlefield. I stopped, for  she was weeping. _Grand Dieu_! I had reaped an actor’s reward, the  success of a counterfeit passion displayed at the cost of five francs  paid at the theatre door. I had drawn tears from her.    “‘If I had known----’ she said.    “‘Do not finish the sentence,’ I broke in. ‘Even now I love you well  enough to murder you----’    “She reached for the bell-pull. I burst into a roar of laughter.    “‘Do not call any one,’ I said. ‘I shall leave you to finish your life  in peace. It would be a blundering kind of hatred that would murder you!  You need not fear violence of any kind; I have spent a whole night at  the foot of your bed without----’    “‘Monsieur----’ she said, blushing; but after that first impulse of  modesty that even the most hardened women must surely own, she flung a  scornful glance at me, and said:    “‘You must have been very cold.’    “‘Do you think that I set such value on your beauty, madame,’ I  answered, guessing the thoughts that moved her. ‘Your beautiful face is  for me a promise of a soul yet more beautiful. Madame, those to whom  a woman is merely a woman can always purchase odalisques fit for the  seraglio, and achieve their happiness at a small cost. But I aspired  to something higher; I wanted the life of close communion of heart  and heart with you that have no heart. I know that now. If you were to  belong to another, I could kill him. And yet, no; for you would love  him, and his death might hurt you perhaps. What agony this is!’ I cried.    “‘If it is any comfort to you,’ she retorted cheerfully, ‘I can assure  you that I shall never belong to any one----’    “‘So you offer an affront to God Himself,’ I interrupted; ‘and you  will be punished for it. Some day you will lie upon your sofa suffering  unheard-of ills, unable to endure the light or the slightest sound,  condemned to live as it were in the tomb. Then, when you seek the causes  of those lingering and avenging torments, you will remember the woes  that you distributed so lavishly upon your way. You have sown curses,  and hatred will be your reward. We are the real judges, the executioners  of a justice that reigns here below, which overrules the justice of man  and the laws of God.’    “‘No doubt it is very culpable in me not to love you,’ she said,  laughing. ‘Am I to blame? No. I do not love you; you are a man, that is  sufficient. I am happy by myself; why should I give up my way of living,  a selfish way, if you will, for the caprices of a master? Marriage is a  sacrament by virtue of which each imparts nothing but vexations to the  other. Children, moreover, worry me. Did I not faithfully warn you about  my nature? Why are you not satisfied to have my friendship? I wish I  could make you amends for all the troubles I have caused you, through  not guessing the value of your poor five-franc pieces. I appreciate the  extent of your sacrifices; but your devotion and delicate tact can be  repaid by love alone, and I care so little for you, that this scene has  a disagreeable effect upon me.’    “‘I am fully aware of my absurdity,’ I said, unable to restrain my  tears. ‘Pardon me,’ I went on, ‘it was a delight to hear those cruel  words you have just uttered, so well I love you. O, if I could testify  my love with every drop of blood in me!’    “‘Men always repeat these classic formulas to us, more or less  effectively,’ she answered, still smiling. ‘But it appears very  difficult to die at our feet, for I see corpses of that kind about  everywhere. It is twelve o’clock. Allow me to go to bed.’    “‘And in two hours’ time you will cry to yourself, _Ah, mon Dieu_!’    “‘Like the day before yesterday! Yes,’ she said, ‘I was thinking of my  stockbroker; I had forgotten to tell him to convert my five per cent  stock into threes, and the three per cents had fallen during the day.’    “I looked at her, and my eyes glittered with anger. Sometimes a  crime may be a whole romance; I understood that just then. She was so  accustomed, no doubt, to the most impassioned declarations of this kind,  that my words and my tears were forgotten already.    “‘Would you marry a peer of France?’ I demanded abruptly.    “‘If he were a duke, I might.’    “I seized my hat and made her a bow.    “‘Permit me to accompany you to the door,’ she said, cutting irony in  her tones, in the poise of her head, and in her gesture.    “‘Madame----’    “‘Monsieur?’    “‘I shall never see you again.’    “‘I hope not,’ and she insolently inclined her head.    “‘You wish to be a duchess?’ I cried, excited by a sort of madness that  her insolence roused in me. ‘You are wild for honors and titles? Well,  only let me love you; bid my pen write and my voice speak for you alone;  be the inmost soul of my life, my guiding star! Then, only accept me  for your husband as a minister, a peer of France, a duke. I will make of  myself whatever you would have me be!’    “‘You made good use of the time you spent with the advocate,’ she said  smiling. ‘There is a fervency about your pleadings.’    “‘The present is yours,’ I cried, ‘but the future is mine! I only lose a  woman; you are losing a name and a family. Time is big with my revenge;  time will spoil your beauty, and yours will be a solitary death; and  glory waits for me!’    “‘Thanks for your peroration!’ she said, repressing a yawn; the wish  that she might never see me again was expressed in her whole bearing.    “That remark silenced me. I flung at her a glance full of hatred, and  hurried away.    “Foedora must be forgotten; I must cure myself of my infatuation, and  betake myself once more to my lonely studies, or die. So I set myself  tremendous tasks; I determined to complete my labors. For fifteen days I  never left my garret, spending whole nights in pallid thought. I worked  with difficulty, and by fits and starts, despite my courage and the  stimulation of despair. The music had fled. I could not exorcise the  brilliant mocking image of Foedora. Something morbid brooded over  every thought, a vague longing as dreadful as remorse. I imitated the  anchorites of the Thebaid. If I did not pray as they did, I lived a life  in the desert like theirs, hewing out my ideas as they were wont to hew  their rocks. I could at need have girdled my waist with spikes, that  physical suffering might quell mental anguish.    “One evening Pauline found her way into my room.    “‘You are killing yourself,’ she said imploringly; ‘you should go out  and see your friends----’    “‘Pauline, you were a true prophet; Foedora is killing me, I want to  die. My life is intolerable.’    “‘Is there only one woman in the world?’ she asked, smiling. ‘Why make  yourself so miserable in so short a life?’    “I looked at Pauline in bewilderment. She left me before I noticed her  departure; the sound of her words had reached me, but not their  sense. Very soon I had to take my Memoirs in manuscript to my  literary-contractor. I was so absorbed by my passion, that I could not  remember how I had managed to live without money; I only knew that the  four hundred and fifty francs due to me would pay my debts. So I went  to receive my salary, and met Rastignac, who thought me changed and  thinner.    “‘What hospital have you been discharged from?’ he asked.    “‘That woman is killing me,’ I answered; ‘I can neither despise her nor  forget her.’    “‘You had much better kill her, then perhaps you would think no more of  her,’ he said, laughing.    “‘I have often thought of it,’ I replied; ‘but though sometimes the  thought of a crime revives my spirits, of violence and murder, either or  both, I am really incapable of carrying out the design. The countess is  an admirable monster who would crave for pardon, and not every man is an  Othello.’    “‘She is like every woman who is beyond our reach,’ Rastignac  interrupted.    “‘I am mad,’ I cried; ‘I can feel the madness raging at times in my  brain. My ideas are like shadows; they flit before me, and I cannot  grasp them. Death would be preferable to this life, and I have carefully  considered the best way of putting an end to the struggle. I am not  thinking of the living Foedora in the Faubourg Saint Honore, but of my  Foedora here,’ and I tapped my forehead. ‘What to you say to opium?’    “‘Pshaw! horrid agonies,’ said Rastignac.    “‘Or charcoal fumes?’    “‘A low dodge.’    “‘Or the Seine?’    “‘The drag-nets, and the Morgue too, are filthy.’    “‘A pistol-shot?’    “‘And if you miscalculate, you disfigure yourself for life. Listen to  me,’ he went on, ‘like all young men, I have pondered over suicide.  Which of us hasn’t killed himself two or three times before he is  thirty? I find there is no better course than to use existence as a  means of pleasure. Go in for thorough dissipation, and your passion or  you will perish in it. Intemperance, my dear fellow, commands all forms  of death. Does she not wield the thunderbolt of apoplexy? Apoplexy is  a pistol-shot that does not miscalculate. Orgies are lavish in all  physical pleasures; is not that the small change for opium? And the riot  that makes us drink to excess bears a challenge to mortal combat with  wine. That butt of Malmsey of the Duke of Clarence’s must have had a  pleasanter flavor than Seine mud. When we sink gloriously under the  table, is not that a periodical death by drowning on a small scale? If  we are picked up by the police and stretched out on those chilly benches  of theirs at the police-station, do we not enjoy all the pleasures of  the Morgue? For though we are not blue and green, muddy and swollen  corpses, on the other hand we have the consciousness of the climax.    “‘Ah,’ he went on, ‘this protracted suicide has nothing in common with  the bankrupt grocer’s demise. Tradespeople have brought the river into  disrepute; they fling themselves in to soften their creditors’ hearts.  In your place I should endeavor to die gracefully; and if you wish  to invent a novel way of doing it, by struggling with life after this  manner, I will be your second. I am disappointed and sick of everything.  The Alsacienne, whom it was proposed that I should marry, had six toes  on her left foot; I cannot possibly live with a woman who has six toes!  It would get about to a certainty, and then I should be ridiculous.  Her income was only eighteen thousand francs; her fortune diminished  in quantity as her toes increased. The devil take it; if we begin an  outrageous sort of life, we may come on some bit of luck, perhaps!’    “Rastignac’s eloquence carried me away. The attractions of the plan  shone too temptingly, hopes were kindled, the poetical aspects of the  matter appealed to a poet.    “‘How about money?’ I said.    “‘Haven’t you four hundred and fifty francs?’    “‘Yes, but debts to my landlady and the tailor----’    “‘You would pay your tailor? You will never be anything whatever, not so  much as a minister.’    “‘But what can one do with twenty louis?’    “‘Go to the gaming-table.’    “I shuddered.    “‘You are going to launch out into what I call systematic dissipation,’  said he, noticing my scruples, ‘and yet you are afraid of a green  table-cloth.’    “‘Listen to me,’ I answered. ‘I promised my father never to set foot in  a gaming-house. Not only is that a sacred promise, but I still feel an  unconquerable disgust whenever I pass a gambling-hell; take the money  and go without me. While our fortune is at stake, I will set my own  affairs straight, and then I will go to your lodgings and wait for you.’    “That was the way I went to perdition. A young man has only to come  across a woman who will not love him, or a woman who loves him too well,  and his whole life becomes a chaos. Prosperity swallows up our energy  just as adversity obscures our virtues. Back once more in my Hotel de  Saint-Quentin, I gazed about me a long while in the garret where I had  led my scholar’s temperate life, a life which would perhaps have been  a long and honorable one, and that I ought not to have quitted for  the fevered existence which had urged me to the brink of a precipice.  Pauline surprised me in this dejected attitude.    “‘Why, what is the matter with you?’ she asked.    “I rose and quietly counted out the money owing to her mother, and added  to it sufficient to pay for six months’ rent in advance. She watched me  in some alarm.    “‘I am going to leave you, dear Pauline.’    “‘I knew it!’ she exclaimed.    “‘Listen, my child. I have not given up the idea of coming back. Keep  my room for me for six months. If I do not return by the fifteenth of  November, you will come into possession of my things. This sealed packet  of manuscript is the fair copy of my great work on “The Will,”’ I went  on, pointing to a package. ‘Will you deposit it in the King’s Library?  And you may do as you wish with everything that is left here.’    “Her look weighed heavily on my heart; Pauline was an embodiment of  conscience there before me.    “‘I shall have no more lessons,’ she said, pointing to the piano.    “I did not answer that.    “‘Will you write to me?’    “‘Good-bye, Pauline.’    “I gently drew her towards me, and set a kiss on that innocent fair brow  of hers, like snow that has not yet touched the earth--a father’s or a  brother’s kiss. She fled. I would not see Madame Gaudin, hung my key in  its wonted place, and departed. I was almost at the end of the Rue de  Cluny when I heard a woman’s light footstep behind me.    “‘I have embroidered this purse for you,’ Pauline said; ‘will you refuse  even that?’    “By the light of the street lamp I thought I saw tears in Pauline’s  eyes, and I groaned. Moved perhaps by a common impulse, we parted in  haste like people who fear the contagion of the plague.    “As I waited with dignified calmness for Rastignac’s return, his room  seemed a grotesque interpretation of the sort of life I was about to  enter upon. The clock on the chimney-piece was surmounted by a Venus  resting on her tortoise; a half-smoked cigar lay in her arms. Costly  furniture of various kinds--love tokens, very likely--was scattered  about. Old shoes lay on a luxurious sofa. The comfortable armchair into  which I had thrown myself bore as many scars as a veteran; the arms were  gnashed, the back was overlaid with a thick, stale deposit of pomade and  hair-oil from the heads of all his visitors. Splendor and squalor were  oddly mingled, on the walls, the bed, and everywhere. You might have  thought of a Neapolitan palace and the groups of lazzaroni about it. It  was the room of a gambler or a mauvais sujet, where the luxury exists  for one individual, who leads the life of the senses and does not  trouble himself over inconsistencies.    “There was a certain imaginative element about the picture it presented.  Life was suddenly revealed there in its rags and spangles as  the incomplete thing it really is, of course, but so vividly and  picturesquely; it was like a den where a brigand has heaped up all the  plunder in which he delights. Some pages were missing from a copy of  Byron’s poems: they had gone to light a fire of a few sticks for this  young person, who played for stakes of a thousand francs, and had not  a faggot; he kept a tilbury, and had not a whole shirt to his back. Any  day a countess or an actress or a run of luck at ecarte might set him up  with an outfit worthy of a king. A candle had been stuck into the green  bronze sheath of a vestaholder; a woman’s portrait lay yonder, torn out  of its carved gold setting. How was it possible that a young man, whose  nature craved excitement, could renounce a life so attractive by reason  of its contradictions; a life that afforded all the delights of war in  the midst of peace? I was growing drowsy when Rastignac kicked the door  open and shouted:    “‘Victory! Now we can take our time about dying.’    “He held out his hat filled with gold to me, and put it down on the  table; then we pranced round it like a pair of cannibals about to eat a  victim; we stamped, and danced, and yelled, and sang; we gave each other  blows fit to kill an elephant, at sight of all the pleasures of the  world contained in that hat.    “‘Twenty-seven thousand francs,’ said Rastignac, adding a few bank-notes  to the pile of gold. ‘That would be enough for other folk to live upon;  will it be sufficient for us to die on? Yes! we will breathe our last in  a bath of gold--hurrah!’ and we capered afresh.    “We divided the windfall. We began with double-napoleons, and came down  to the smaller coins, one by one. ‘This for you, this for me,’ we kept  saying, distilling our joy drop by drop.    “‘We won’t go to sleep,’ cried Rastignac. ‘Joseph! some punch!’    “He threw gold to his faithful attendant.    “‘There is your share,’ he said; ‘go and bury yourself if you can.’    “Next day I went to Lesage and chose my furniture, took the rooms that  you know in the Rue Taitbout, and left the decoration to one of the best  upholsterers. I bought horses. I plunged into a vortex of pleasures, at  once hollow and real. I went in for play, gaining and losing  enormous sums, but only at friends’ houses and in ballrooms; never in  gaming-houses, for which I still retained the holy horror of my early  days. Without meaning it, I made some friends, either through quarrels  or owing to the easy confidence established among those who are going  to the bad together; nothing, possibly, makes us cling to one another so  tightly as our evil propensities.    “I made several ventures in literature, which were flatteringly  received. Great men who followed the profession of letters, having  nothing to fear from me, belauded me, not so much on account of my  merits as to cast a slur on those of their rivals.    “I became a ‘free-liver,’ to make use of the picturesque expression  appropriated by the language of excess. I made it a point of honor not  to be long about dying, and that my zeal and prowess should eclipse  those displayed by all others in the jolliest company. I was always  spruce and carefully dressed. I had some reputation for cleverness.  There was no sign about me of the fearful way of living which makes a  man into a mere disgusting apparatus, a funnel, a pampered beast.    “Very soon Debauch rose before me in all the majesty of its horror, and  I grasped all that it meant. Those prudent, steady-going characters who  are laying down wine in bottles for their heirs, can barely conceive,  it is true, of so wide a theory of life, nor appreciate its normal  condition; but when will you instill poetry into the provincial  intellect? Opium and tea, with all their delights, are merely drugs to  folk of that calibre.    “Is not the imperfect sybarite to be met with even in Paris itself, that  intellectual metropolis? Unfit to endure the fatigues of pleasure, this  sort of person, after a drinking bout, is very much like those worthy  bourgeois who fall foul of music after hearing a new opera by Rossini.  Does he not renounce these courses in the same frame of mind that leads  an abstemious man to forswear Ruffec pates, because the first one,  forsooth, gave him the indigestion?    “Debauch is as surely an art as poetry, and is not for craven spirits.  To penetrate its mysteries and appreciate its charms, conscientious  application is required; and as with every path of knowledge, the way is  thorny and forbidding at the outset. The great pleasures of humanity are  hedged about with formidable obstacles; not its single enjoyments, but  enjoyment as a system, a system which establishes seldom experienced  sensations and makes them habitual, which concentrates and multiplies  them for us, creating a dramatic life within our life, and imperatively  demanding a prompt and enormous expenditure of vitality. War, Power,  Art, like Debauch, are all forms of demoralization, equally remote from  the faculties of humanity, equally profound, and all are alike difficult  of access. But when man has once stormed the heights of these grand  mysteries, does he not walk in another world? Are not generals,  ministers, and artists carried, more or less, towards destruction by  the need of violent distractions in an existence so remote from ordinary  life as theirs?    “War, after all, is the Excess of bloodshed, as the Excess of  self-interest produces Politics. Excesses of every sort are brothers.  These social enormities possess the attraction of the abyss; they draw  towards themselves as St. Helena beckoned Napoleon; we are fascinated,  our heads swim, we wish to sound their depths though we cannot  account for the wish. Perhaps the thought of Infinity dwells in these  precipices, perhaps they contain some colossal flattery for the soul of  man; for is he not, then, wholly absorbed in himself?    “The wearied artist needs a complete contrast to his paradise of  imaginings and of studious hours; he either craves, like God, the  seventh day of rest, or with Satan, the pleasures of hell; so that  his senses may have free play in opposition to the employment of his  faculties. Byron could never have taken for his relaxation to the  independent gentleman’s delights of boston and gossip, for he was a  poet, and so must needs pit Greece against Mahmoud.    “In war, is not man an angel of extirpation, a sort of executioner on  a gigantic scale? Must not the spell be strong indeed that makes us  undergo such horrid sufferings so hostile to our weak frames, sufferings  that encircle every strong passion with a hedge of thorns? The tobacco  smoker is seized with convulsions, and goes through a kind of agony  consequent upon his excesses; but has he not borne a part in delightful  festivals in realms unknown? Has Europe ever ceased from wars? She  has never given herself time to wipe the stains from her feet that are  steeped in blood to the ankle. Mankind at large is carried away by fits  of intoxication, as nature has its accessions of love.    “For men in private life, for a vegetating Mirabeau dreaming of storms  in a time of calm, Excess comprises all things; it perpetually embraces  the whole sum of life; it is something better still--it is a duel with  an antagonist of unknown power, a monster, terrible at first sight, that  must be seized by the horns, a labor that cannot be imagined.    “Suppose that nature has endowed you with a feeble stomach or one of  limited capacity; you acquire a mastery over it and improve it; you  learn to carry your liquor; you grow accustomed to being drunk; you pass  whole nights without sleep; at last you acquire the constitution of a  colonel of cuirassiers; and in this way you create yourself afresh, as  if to fly in the face of Providence.    “A man transformed after this sort is like a neophyte who has at last  become a veteran, has accustomed his mind to shot and shell and his legs  to lengthy marches. When the monster’s hold on him is still uncertain,  and it is not yet known which will have the better of it, they roll over  and over, alternately victor and vanquished, in a world where everything  is wonderful, where every ache of the soul is laid to sleep, where only  the shadows of ideas are revived.    “This furious struggle has already become a necessity for us. The  prodigal has struck a bargain for all the enjoyments with which life  teems abundantly, at the price of his own death, like the mythical  persons in legends who sold themselves to the devil for the power of  doing evil. For them, instead of flowing quietly on in its monotonous  course in the depths of some counting-house or study, life is poured out  in a boiling torrent.    “Excess is, in short, for the body what the mystic’s ecstasy is for  the soul. Intoxication steeps you in fantastic imaginings every whit as  strange as those of ecstatics. You know hours as full of rapture as a  young girl’s dreams; you travel without fatigue; you chat pleasantly  with your friends; words come to you with a whole life in each, and  fresh pleasures without regrets; poems are set forth for you in a few  brief phrases. The coarse animal satisfaction, in which science has  tried to find a soul, is followed by the enchanted drowsiness that men  sigh for under the burden of consciousness. Is it not because they all  feel the need of absolute repose? Because Excess is a sort of toll that  genius pays to pain?    “Look at all great men; nature made them pleasure-loving or base, every  one. Some mocking or jealous power corrupted them in either soul or  body, so as to make all their powers futile, and their efforts of no  avail.    “All men and all things appear before you in the guise you choose,  in those hours when wine has sway. You are lord of all creation; you  transform it at your pleasure. And throughout this unceasing delirium,  Play may pour, at your will, its molten lead into your veins.    “Some day you will fall into the monster’s power. Then you will have, as  I had, a frenzied awakening, with impotence sitting by your pillow. Are  you an old soldier? Phthisis attacks you. A diplomatist? An aneurism  hangs death in your heart by a thread. It will perhaps be consumption  that will cry out to me, ‘Let us be going!’ as to Raphael of Urbino, in  old time, killed by an excess of love.    “In this way I have existed. I was launched into the world too early or  too late. My energy would have been dangerous there, no doubt, if I had  not have squandered it in such ways as these. Was not the world rid of  an Alexander, by the cup of Hercules, at the close of a drinking bout?    “There are some, the sport of Destiny, who must either have heaven or  hell, the hospice of St. Bernard or riotous excess. Only just now  I lacked the heart to moralize about those two,” and he pointed to  Euphrasia and Aquilina. “They are types of my own personal history,  images of my life! I could scarcely reproach them; they stood before me  like judges.    “In the midst of this drama that I was enacting, and while my  distracting disorder was at its height, two crises supervened; each  brought me keen and abundant pangs. The first came a few days after I  had flung myself, like Sardanapalus, on my pyre. I met Foedora under the  peristyle of the Bouffons. We both were waiting for our carriages.    “‘Ah! so you are living yet?’    “That was the meaning of her smile, and probably of the spiteful words  she murmured in the ear of her cicisbeo, telling him my history no  doubt, rating mine as a common love affair. She was deceived, yet she  was applauding her perspicacity. Oh, that I should be dying for her,  must still adore her, always see her through my potations, see her still  when I was overcome with wine, or in the arms of courtesans; and know  that I was a target for her scornful jests! Oh, that I should be unable  to tear the love of her out of my breast and to fling it at her feet!    “Well, I quickly exhausted my funds, but owing to those three years  of discipline, I enjoyed the most robust health, and on the day that I  found myself without a penny I felt remarkably well. In order to carry  on the process of dying, I signed bills at short dates, and the day came  when they must be met. Painful excitements! but how they quicken the  pulses of youth! I was not prematurely aged; I was young yet, and full  of vigor and life.    “At my first debt all my virtues came to life; slowly and despairingly  they seemed to pace towards me; but I could compound with them--they  were like aged aunts that begin with a scolding and end by bestowing  tears and money upon you.    “Imagination was less yielding; I saw my name bandied about through  every city in Europe. ‘One’s name is oneself’ says Eusebe Salverte.  After these excursions I returned to the room I had never quitted, like  a doppelganger in a German tale, and came to myself with a start.    “I used to see with indifference a banker’s messenger going on his  errands through the streets of Paris, like a commercial Nemesis, wearing  his master’s livery--a gray coat and a silver badge; but now I hated the  species in advance. One of them came one morning to ask me to meet some  eleven bills that I had scrawled my name upon. My signature was worth  three thousand francs! Taking me altogether, I myself was not worth  that amount. Sheriff’s deputies rose up before me, turning their callous  faces upon my despair, as the hangman regards the criminal to whom he  says, ‘It has just struck half-past three.’ I was in the power of their  clerks; they could scribble my name, drag it through the mire, and jeer  at it. I was a defaulter. Has a debtor any right to himself? Could  not other men call me to account for my way of living? Why had I eaten  puddings _a la chipolata_? Why had I iced my wine? Why had I slept, or  walked, or thought, or amused myself when I had not paid them?    “At any moment, in the middle of a poem, during some train of thought,  or while I was gaily breakfasting in the pleasant company of my friends,  I might look to see a gentleman enter in a coat of chestnut-brown, with  a shabby hat in his hand. This gentleman’s appearance would signify my  debt, the bill I had drawn; the spectre would compel me to leave the  table to speak to him, blight my spirits, despoil me of my cheerfulness,  of my mistress, of all I possessed, down to my very bedstead.    “Remorse itself is more easily endured. Remorse does not drive us into  the street nor into the prison of Sainte-Pelagie; it does not force  us into the detestable sink of vice. Remorse only brings us to the  scaffold, where the executioner invests us with a certain dignity; as we  pay the extreme penalty, everybody believes in our innocence; but people  will not credit a penniless prodigal with a single virtue.    “My debts had other incarnations. There is the kind that goes about on  two feet, in a green cloth coat, and blue spectacles, carrying umbrellas  of various hues; you come face to face with him at the corner of  some street, in the midst of your mirth. These have the detestable  prerogative of saying, ‘M. de Valentin owes me something, and does  not pay. I have a hold on him. He had better not show me any offensive  airs!’ You must bow to your creditors, and moreover bow politely. ‘When  are you going to pay me?’ say they. And you must lie, and beg money of  another man, and cringe to a fool seated on his strong-box, and receive  sour looks in return from these horse-leeches; a blow would be less  hateful; you must put up with their crass ignorance and calculating  morality. A debt is a feat of the imaginative that they cannot  appreciate. A borrower is often carried away and over-mastered by  generous impulses; nothing great, nothing magnanimous can move or  dominate those who live for money, and recognize nothing but money. I  myself held money in abhorrence.    “Or a bill may undergo a final transformation into some meritorious  old man with a family dependent upon him. My creditor might be a living  picture for Greuze, a paralytic with his children round him, a soldier’s  widow, holding out beseeching hands to me. Terrible creditors are  these with whom we are forced to sympathize, and when their claims are  satisfied we owe them a further debt of assistance.    “The night before the bills fell due, I lay down with the false calm of  those who sleep before their approaching execution, or with a duel in  prospect, rocked as they are by delusive hopes. But when I woke, when  I was cool and collected, when I found myself imprisoned in a banker’s  portfolio, and floundering in statements covered with red ink--then my  debts sprang up everywhere, like grasshoppers, before my eyes. There  were my debts, my clock, my armchairs; my debts were inlaid in the very  furniture which I liked best to use. These gentle inanimate slaves were  to fall prey to the harpies of the Chatelet, were to be carried off by  the broker’s men, and brutally thrown on the market. Ah, my property was  a part of myself!    “The sound of the door-bell rang through my heart; while it seemed to  strike at me, where kings should be struck at--in the head. Mine was a  martyrdom, without heaven for its reward. For a magnanimous nature, debt  is a hell, and a hell, moreover, with sheriff’s officers and brokers in  it. An undischarged debt is something mean and sordid; it is a beginning  of knavery; it is something worse, it is a lie; it prepares the way for  crime, and brings together the planks for the scaffold. My bills  were protested. Three days afterwards I met them, and this is how it  happened.    “A speculator came, offering to buy the island in the Loire belonging  to me, where my mother lay buried. I closed with him. When I went to  his solicitor to sign the deeds, I felt a cavern-like chill in the dark  office that made me shudder; it was the same cold dampness that had laid  hold upon me at the brink of my father’s grave. I looked upon this as  an evil omen. I seemed to see the shade of my mother, and to hear her  voice. What power was it that made my own name ring vaguely in my ears,  in spite of the clamor of bells?    “The money paid down for my island, when all my debts were discharged,  left me in possession of two thousand francs. I could now have returned  to the scholar’s tranquil life, it is true; I could have gone back to  my garret after having gained an experience of life, with my head filled  with the results of extensive observation, and with a certain sort of  reputation attaching to me. But Foedora’s hold upon her victim was not  relaxed. We often met. I compelled her admirers to sound my name in her  ears, by dint of astonishing them with my cleverness and success, with  my horses and equipages. It all found her impassive and uninterested; so  did an ugly phrase of Rastignac’s, ‘He is killing himself for you.’    “I charged the world at large with my revenge, but I was not happy.  While I was fathoming the miry depths of life, I only recognized the  more keenly at all times the happiness of reciprocal affection; it was  a shadow that I followed through all that befell me in my extravagance,  and in my wildest moments. It was my misfortune to be deceived in my  fairest beliefs, to be punished by ingratitude for benefiting others,  and to receive uncounted pleasures as the reward of my errors--a  sinister doctrine, but a true one for the prodigal!    “The contagious leprosy of Foedora’s vanity had taken hold of me at  last. I probed my soul, and found it cankered and rotten. I bore the  marks of the devil’s claw upon my forehead. It was impossible to me  thenceforward to do without the incessant agitation of a life fraught  with danger at every moment, or to dispense with the execrable  refinements of luxury. If I had possessed millions, I should still have  gambled, reveled, and racketed about. I wished never to be alone with  myself, and I must have false friends and courtesans, wine and good  cheer to distract me. The ties that attach a man to family life had been  permanently broken for me. I had become a galley-slave of pleasure,  and must accomplish my destiny of suicide. During the last days of my  prosperity, I spent every night in the most incredible excesses; but  every morning death cast me back upon life again. I would have taken  a conflagration with as little concern as any man with a life annuity.  However, I at last found myself alone with a twenty-franc piece; I  bethought me then of Rastignac’s luck----    “Eh, eh!----” Raphael exclaimed, interrupting himself, as he remembered  the talisman and drew it from his pocket. Perhaps he was wearied by the  long day’s strain, and had no more strength left wherewith to pilot his  head through the seas of wine and punch; or perhaps, exasperated by this  symbol of his own existence, the torrent of his own eloquence gradually  overwhelmed him. Raphael became excited and elated and like one  completely deprived of reason.    “The devil take death!” he shouted, brandishing the skin; “I mean to  live! I am rich, I have every virtue; nothing will withstand me. Who  would not be generous, when everything is in his power? Aha! Aha! I  wished for two hundred thousand livres a year, and I shall have them.  Bow down before me, all of you, wallowing on the carpets like swine in  the mire! You all belong to me--a precious property truly! I am rich; I  could buy you all, even the deputy snoring over there. Scum of society,  give me your benediction! I am the Pope.”    Raphael’s vociferations had been hitherto drowned by a thorough-bass  of snores, but now they became suddenly audible. Most of the sleepers  started up with a cry, saw the cause of the disturbance on his feet,  tottering uncertainly, and cursed him in concert for a drunken brawler.    “Silence!” shouted Raphael. “Back to your kennels, you dogs! Emile, I  have riches, I will give you Havana cigars!”    “I am listening,” the poet replied. “Death or Foedora! On with you! That  silky Foedora deceived you. Women are all daughters of Eve. There is  nothing dramatic about that rigmarole of yours.”    “Ah, but you were sleeping, slyboots.”    “No--‘Death or Foedora!’--I have it!”    “Wake up!” Raphael shouted, beating Emile with the piece of shagreen as  if he meant to draw electric fluid out of it.    “_Tonnerre_!” said Emile, springing up and flinging his arms round  Raphael; “my friend, remember the sort of women you are with.”    “I am a millionaire!”    “If you are not a millionaire, you are most certainly drunk.”    “Drunk with power. I can kill you!--Silence! I am Nero! I am  Nebuchadnezzar!”    “But, Raphael, we are in queer company, and you ought to keep quiet for  the sake of your own dignity.”    “My life has been silent too long. I mean to have my revenge now on the  world at large. I will not amuse myself by squandering paltry five-franc  pieces; I will reproduce and sum up my epoch by absorbing human  lives, human minds, and human souls. There are the treasures of  pestilence--that is no paltry kind of wealth, is it? I will wrestle with  fevers--yellow, blue, or green--with whole armies, with gibbets. I can  possess Foedora--Yet no, I do not want Foedora; she is a disease; I am  dying of Foedora. I want to forget Foedora.”    “If you keep on calling out like this, I shall take you into the  dining-room.”    “Do you see this skin? It is Solomon’s will. Solomon belongs to me--a  little varlet of a king! Arabia is mine, Arabia Petraea to boot; and the  universe, and you too, if I choose. If I choose--Ah! be careful. I can  buy up all our journalist’s shop; you shall be my valet. You shall be  my valet, you shall manage my newspaper. Valet! _valet_, that is to say,  free from aches and pains, because he has no brains.”    At the word, Emile carried Raphael off into the dining-room.    “All right,” he remarked; “yes, my friend, I am your valet. But you  are about to be editor-in-chief of a newspaper; so be quiet, and behave  properly, for my sake. Have you no regard for me?”    “Regard for you! You shall have Havana cigars, with this bit of  shagreen: always with this skin, this supreme bit of shagreen. It is  a cure for corns, and efficacious remedy. Do you suffer? I will remove  them.”    “Never have I known you so senseless----”    “Senseless, my friend? Not at all. This skin contracts whenever I form a  wish--‘tis a paradox. There is a Brahmin underneath it! The Brahmin must  be a droll fellow, for our desires, look you, are bound to expand----”    “Yes, yes----”    “I tell you----”    “Yes, yes, very true, I am quite of your opinion--our desires  expand----”    “The skin, I tell you.”    “Yes.”    “You don’t believe me. I know you, my friend; you are as full of lies as  a new-made king.”    “How can you expect me to follow your drunken maunderings?”    “I will bet you I can prove it. Let us measure it----”    “Goodness! he will never get off to sleep,” exclaimed Emile, as he  watched Raphael rummaging busily in the dining-room.    Thanks to the peculiar clearness with which external objects are  sometimes projected on an inebriated brain, in sharp contrast to its own  obscure imaginings, Valentin found an inkstand and a table-napkin, with  the quickness of a monkey, repeating all the time:    “Let us measure it! Let us measure it!”    “All right,” said Emile; “let us measure it!”    The two friends spread out the table-napkin and laid the Magic Skin upon  it. As Emile’s hand appeared to be steadier than Raphael’s, he drew a  line with pen and ink round the talisman, while his friend said:    “I wished for an income of two hundred thousand livres, didn’t I? Well,  when that comes, you will observe a mighty diminution of my chagrin.”    “Yes--now go to sleep. Shall I make you comfortable on that sofa? Now  then, are you all right?”    “Yes, my nursling of the press. You shall amuse me; you shall drive  the flies away from me. The friend of adversity should be the friend of  prosperity. So I will give you some Hava--na--cig----”    “Come, now, sleep. Sleep off your gold, you millionaire!”    “You! sleep off your paragraphs! Good-night! Say good-night to  Nebuchadnezzar!--Love! Wine! France!--glory and tr--treas----”    Very soon the snorings of the two friends were added to the music with  which the rooms resounded--an ineffectual concert! The lights went out  one by one, their crystal sconces cracking in the final flare. Night  threw dark shadows over this prolonged revelry, in which Raphael’s  narrative had been a second orgy of speech, of words without ideas, of  ideas for which words had often been lacking.    Towards noon, next day, the fair Aquilina bestirred herself. She yawned  wearily. She had slept with her head upon a painted velvet footstool,  and her cheeks were mottled over by contact with the surface. Her  movement awoke Euphrasia, who suddenly sprang up with a hoarse cry; her  pretty face, that had been so fresh and fair in the evening, was sallow  now and pallid; she looked like a candidate for the hospital. The rest  awoke also by degrees, with portentous groanings, to feel themselves  over in every stiffened limb, and to experience the infinite varieties  of weariness that weighed upon them.    A servant came in to throw back the shutters and open the windows.  There they all stood, brought back to consciousness by the warm rays  of sunlight that shone upon the sleepers’ heads. Their movements during  slumber had disordered the elaborately arranged hair and toilettes of  the women. They presented a ghastly spectacle in the bright daylight.  Their hair fell ungracefully about them; their eyes, lately so  brilliant, were heavy and dim; the expression of their faces was  entirely changed. The sickly hues, which daylight brings out so  strongly, were frightful. An olive tint had crept over the lymphatic  faces, so fair and soft when in repose; the dainty red lips were  grown pale and dry, and bore tokens of the degradation of excess. Each  disowned his mistress of the night before; the women looked wan and  discolored, like flowers trampled under foot by a passing procession.    The men who scorned them looked even more horrible. Those human faces  would have made you shudder. The hollow eyes with the dark circles round  them seemed to see nothing; they were dull with wine and stupefied with  heavy slumbers that had been exhausting rather than refreshing. There  was an indescribable ferocious and stolid bestiality about these haggard  faces, where bare physical appetite appeared shorn of all the poetical  illusion with which the intellect invests it. Even these fearless  champions, accustomed to measure themselves with excess, were struck  with horror at this awakening of vice, stripped of its disguises, at  being confronted thus with sin, the skeleton in rags, lifeless and  hollow, bereft of the sophistries of the intellect and the enchantments  of luxury. Artists and courtesans scrutinized in silence and with  haggard glances the surrounding disorder, the rooms where everything had  been laid waste, at the havoc wrought by heated passions.    Demoniac laughter broke out when Taillefer, catching the smothered  murmurs of his guests, tried to greet them with a grin. His darkly  flushed, perspiring countenance loomed upon this pandemonium, like the  image of a crime that knows no remorse (see _L’Auberge rouge_). The  picture was complete. A picture of a foul life in the midst of luxury, a  hideous mixture of the pomp and squalor of humanity; an awakening after  the frenzy of Debauch has crushed and squeezed all the fruits of life in  her strong hands, till nothing but unsightly refuse is left to her, and  lies in which she believes no longer. You might have thought of Death  gloating over a family stricken with the plague.    The sweet scents and dazzling lights, the mirth and the excitement  were all no more; disgust with its nauseous sensations and searching  philosophy was there instead. The sun shone in like truth, the pure  outer air was like virtue; in contrast with the heated atmosphere, heavy  with the fumes of the previous night of revelry.    Accustomed as they were to their life, many of the girls thought of  other days and other wakings; pure and innocent days when they looked  out and saw the roses and honeysuckle about the casement, and the fresh  countryside without enraptured by the glad music of the skylark; while  earth lay in mists, lighted by the dawn, and in all the glittering  radiance of dew. Others imagined the family breakfast, the father and  children round the table, the innocent laughter, the unspeakable charm  that pervaded it all, the simple hearts and their meal as simple.    An artist mused upon his quiet studio, on his statue in its severe  beauty, and the graceful model who was waiting for him. A young man  recollected a lawsuit on which the fortunes of a family hung, and an  important transaction that needed his presence. The scholar regretted  his study and that noble work that called for him. Emile appeared just  then as smiling, blooming, and fresh as the smartest assistant in a  fashionable shop.    “You are all as ugly as bailiffs. You won’t be fit for anything to-day,  so this day is lost, and I vote for breakfast.”    At this Taillefer went out to give some orders. The women went languidly  up to the mirrors to set their toilettes in order. Each one shook  herself. The wilder sort lectured the steadier ones. The courtesans made  fun of those who looked unable to continue the boisterous festivity;  but these wan forms revived all at once, stood in groups, and talked  and smiled. Some servants quickly and adroitly set the furniture and  everything else in its place, and a magnificent breakfast was got ready.    The guests hurried into the dining-room. Everything there bore indelible  marks of yesterday’s excess, it is true, but there were at any rate some  traces of ordinary, rational existence, such traces as may be found in a  sick man’s dying struggles. And so the revelry was laid away and buried,  like carnival of a Shrove Tuesday, by masks wearied out with dancing,  drunk with drunkenness, and quite ready to be persuaded of the pleasures  of lassitude, lest they should be forced to admit their exhaustion.    As soon as these bold spirits surrounded the capitalist’s  breakfast-table, Cardot appeared. He had left the rest to make a night  of it after the dinner, and finished the evening after his own fashion  in the retirement of domestic life. Just now a sweet smile wandered over  his features. He seemed to have a presentiment that there would be some  inheritance to sample and divide, involving inventories and engrossing;  an inheritance rich in fees and deeds to draw up, and something as juicy  as the trembling fillet of beef in which their host had just plunged his  knife.    “Oh, ho! we are to have breakfast in the presence of a notary,” cried  Cursy.    “You have come here just at the right time,” said the banker, indicating  the breakfast; “you can jot down the numbers, and initial off all the  dishes.”    “There is no will to make here, but contracts of marriage there may be,  perhaps,” said the scholar, who had made a satisfactory arrangement for  the first time in twelve months.    “Oh! Oh!”    “Ah! Ah!”    “One moment,” cried Cardot, fairly deafened by a chorus of wretched  jokes. “I came here on serious business. I am bringing six millions for  one of you.” (Dead silence.) “Monsieur,” he went on, turning to Raphael,  who at the moment was unceremoniously wiping his eyes on a corner of the  table-napkin, “was not your mother a Mlle. O’Flaharty?”    “Yes,” said Raphael mechanically enough; “Barbara Marie.”    “Have you your certificate of birth about you,” Cardot went on, “and  Mme. de Valentin’s as well?”    “I believe so.”    “Very well then, monsieur; you are the sole heir of Major O’Flaharty,  who died in August 1828 at Calcutta.”    “An _incalcuttable_ fortune,” said the critic.    “The Major having bequeathed several amounts to public institutions in  his will, the French Government sent in a claim for the remainder to  the East India Company,” the notary continued. “The estate is clear and  ready to be transferred at this moment. I have been looking in vain for  the heirs and assigns of Mlle. Barbara Marie O’Flaharty for a fortnight  past, when yesterday at dinner----”    Just then Raphael suddenly staggered to his feet; he looked like a man  who has just received a blow. Acclamation took the form of silence, for  stifled envy had been the first feeling in every breast, and all eyes  devoured him like flames. Then a murmur rose, and grew like the voice of  a discontented audience, or the first mutterings of a riot, as everybody  made some comment on this news of great wealth brought by the notary.    This abrupt subservience of fate brought Raphael thoroughly to his  senses. He immediately spread out the table-napkin with which he had  lately taken the measure of the piece of shagreen. He heeded nothing as  he laid the talisman upon it, and shuddered involuntarily at the sight  of a slight difference between the present size of the skin and the  outline traced upon the linen.    “Why, what is the matter with him?” Taillefer cried. “He comes by his  fortune very cheaply.”    “_Soutiens-le Chatillon_!” said Bixiou to Emile. “The joy will kill  him.”    A ghastly white hue overspread every line of the wan features of the  heir-at-law. His face was drawn, every outline grew haggard; the hollows  in his livid countenance grew deeper, and his eyes were fixed and  staring. He was facing Death.    The opulent banker, surrounded by faded women, and faces with satiety  written on them, the enjoyment that had reached the pitch of agony, was  a living illustration of his own life.    Raphael looked thrice at the talisman, which lay passively within the  merciless outlines on the table-napkin; he tried not to believe it,  but his incredulity vanished utterly before the light of an inner  presentiment. The whole world was his; he could have all things, but the  will to possess them was utterly extinct. Like a traveler in the midst  of the desert, with but a little water left to quench his thirst, he  must measure his life by the draughts he took of it. He saw what every  desire of his must cost him in the days of his life. He believed in the  powers of the Magic Skin at last, he listened to every breath he drew;  he felt ill already; he asked himself:    “Am I not consumptive? Did not my mother die of a lung complaint?”    “Aha, Raphael! what fun you will have! What will you give me?” asked  Aquilina.    “Here’s to the death of his uncle, Major O’Flaharty! There is a man for  you.”    “He will be a peer of France.”    “Pooh! what is a peer of France since July?” said the amateur critic.    “Are you going to take a box at the Bouffons?”    “You are going to treat us all, I hope?” put in Bixiou.    “A man of his sort will be sure to do things in style,” said Emile.    The hurrah set up by the jovial assembly rang in Valentin’s ears, but he  could not grasp the sense of a single word. Vague thoughts crossed him  of the Breton peasant’s life of mechanical labor, without a wish of any  kind; he pictured him burdened with a family, tilling the soil, living  on buckwheat meal, drinking cider out of a pitcher, believing in the  Virgin and the King, taking the sacrament at Easter, dancing of a Sunday  on the green sward, and understanding never a word of the rector’s  sermon. The actual scene that lay before him, the gilded furniture, the  courtesans, the feast itself, and the surrounding splendors, seemed to  catch him by the throat and made him cough.    “Do you wish for some asparagus?” the banker cried.    “_I wish for nothing_!” thundered Raphael.    “Bravo!” Taillefer exclaimed; “you understand your position; a  fortune confers the privilege of being impertinent. You are one of us.  Gentlemen, let us drink to the might of gold! M. Valentin here, six  times a millionaire, has become a power. He is a king, like all the  rich; everything is at his disposal, everything lies under his feet.  From this time forth the axiom that ‘all Frenchmen are alike in the eyes  of the law,’ is for him a fib at the head of the Constitutional Charter.  He is not going to obey the law--the law is going to obey him. There are  neither scaffolds nor executioners for millionaires.”    “Yes, there are,” said Raphael; “they are their own executioners.”    “Here is another victim of prejudices!” cried the banker.    “Let us drink!” Raphael said, putting the talisman into his pocket.    “What are you doing?” said Emile, checking his movement. “Gentlemen,” he  added, addressing the company, who were rather taken aback by Raphael’s  behavior, “you must know that our friend Valentin here--what am I  saying?--I mean my Lord Marquis de Valentin--is in the possession of  a secret for obtaining wealth. His wishes are fulfilled as soon as he  knows them. He will make us all rich together, or he is a flunkey, and  devoid of all decent feeling.”    “Oh, Raphael dear, I should like a set of pearl ornaments!” Euphrasia  exclaimed.    “If he has any gratitude in him, he will give me a couple of carriages  with fast steppers,” said Aquilina.    “Wish for a hundred thousand a year for me!”    “Indian shawls!”    “Pay my debts!”    “Send an apoplexy to my uncle, the old stick!”    “Ten thousand a year in the funds, and I’ll cry quits with you,  Raphael!”    “Deeds of gift and no mistake,” was the notary’s comment.    “He ought, at least, to rid me of the gout!”    “Lower the funds!” shouted the banker.    These phrases flew about like the last discharge of rockets at the end  of a display of fireworks; and were uttered, perhaps, more in earnest  than in jest.    “My good friend,” Emile said solemnly, “I shall be quite satisfied with  an income of two hundred thousand livres. Please to set about it at  once.”    “Do you not know the cost, Emile?” asked Raphael.    “A nice excuse!” the poet cried; “ought we not to sacrifice ourselves  for our friends?”    “I have almost a mind to wish that you all were dead,” Valentin made  answer, with a dark, inscrutable look at his boon companions.    “Dying people are frightfully cruel,” said Emile, laughing. “You are  rich now,” he went on gravely; “very well, I will give you two months at  most before you grow vilely selfish. You are so dense already that  you cannot understand a joke. You have only to go a little further to  believe in your Magic Skin.”    Raphael kept silent, fearing the banter of the company; but he drank  immoderately, trying to drown in intoxication the recollection of his  fatal power.          III. THE AGONY    In the early days of December an old man of some seventy years of age  pursued his way along the Rue de Varenne, in spite of the falling rain.  He peered up at the door of each house, trying to discover the address  of the Marquis Raphael de Valentin, in a simple, childlike fashion,  and with the abstracted look peculiar to philosophers. His face plainly  showed traces of a struggle between a heavy mortification and an  authoritative nature; his long, gray hair hung in disorder about a face  like a piece of parchment shriveling in the fire. If a painter had come  upon this curious character, he would, no doubt, have transferred him  to his sketchbook on his return, a thin, bony figure, clad in black, and  have inscribed beneath it: “Classical poet in search of a rhyme.”   When he had identified the number that had been given to him, this  reincarnation of Rollin knocked meekly at the door of a splendid  mansion.    “Is Monsieur Raphael in?” the worthy man inquired of the Swiss in  livery.    “My Lord the Marquis sees nobody,” said the servant, swallowing a huge  morsel that he had just dipped in a large bowl of coffee.    “There is his carriage,” said the elderly stranger, pointing to a fine  equipage that stood under the wooden canopy that sheltered the steps  before the house, in place of a striped linen awning. “He is going out;  I will wait for him.”    “Then you might wait here till to-morrow morning, old boy,” said the  Swiss. “A carriage is always waiting for monsieur. Please to go away. If  I were to let any stranger come into the house without orders, I should  lose an income of six hundred francs.”    A tall old man, in a costume not unlike that of a subordinate in the  Civil Service, came out of the vestibule and hurried part of the  way down the steps, while he made a survey of the astonished elderly  applicant for admission.    “What is more, here is M. Jonathan,” the Swiss remarked; “speak to him.”    Fellow-feeling of some kind, or curiosity, brought the two old men  together in a central space in the great entrance-court. A few blades of  grass were growing in the crevices of the pavement; a terrible silence  reigned in that great house. The sight of Jonathan’s face would have  made you long to understand the mystery that brooded over it, and that  was announced by the smallest trifles about the melancholy place.    When Raphael inherited his uncle’s vast estate, his first care had been  to seek out the old and devoted servitor of whose affection he knew that  he was secure. Jonathan had wept tears of joy at the sight of his young  master, of whom he thought he had taken a final farewell; and when the  marquis exalted him to the high office of steward, his happiness could  not be surpassed. So old Jonathan became an intermediary power between  Raphael and the world at large. He was the absolute disposer of his  master’s fortune, the blind instrument of an unknown will, and a sixth  sense, as it were, by which the emotions of life were communicated to  Raphael.    “I should like to speak with M. Raphael, sir,” said the elderly person  to Jonathan, as he climbed up the steps some way, into a shelter from  the rain.    “To speak with my Lord the Marquis?” the steward cried. “He scarcely  speaks even to me, his foster-father!”    “But I am likewise his foster-father,” said the old man. “If your wife  was his foster-mother, I fed him myself with the milk of the Muses. He  is my nursling, my child, carus alumnus! I formed his mind, cultivated  his understanding, developed his genius, and, I venture to say it, to  my own honor and glory. Is he not one of the most remarkable men of our  epoch? He was one of my pupils in two lower forms, and in rhetoric. I am  his professor.”    “Ah, sir, then you are M. Porriquet?”    “Exactly, sir, but----”    “Hush! hush!” Jonathan called to two underlings, whose voices broke the  monastic silence that shrouded the house.    “But is the Marquis ill, sir?” the professor continued.    “My dear sir,” Jonathan replied, “Heaven only knows what is the matter  with my master. You see, there are not a couple of houses like ours  anywhere in Paris. Do you understand? Not two houses. Faith, that  there are not. My Lord the Marquis had this hotel purchased for him; it  formerly belonged to a duke and a peer of France; then he spent three  hundred thousand francs over furnishing it. That’s a good deal, you  know, three hundred thousand francs! But every room in the house is a  perfect wonder. ‘Good,’ said I to myself when I saw this magnificence;  ‘it is just like it used to be in the time of my lord, his late  grandfather; and the young marquis is going to entertain all Paris  and the Court!’ Nothing of the kind! My lord refused to see any one  whatever. ‘Tis a funny life that he leads, M. Porriquet, you understand.  An _inconciliable_ life. He rises every day at the same time. I am the  only person, you see, that may enter his room. I open all the shutters  at seven o’clock, summer or winter. It is all arranged very oddly. As I  come in I say to him:    “‘You must get up and dress, my Lord Marquis.’    “Then he rises and dresses himself. I have to give him his  dressing-gown, and it is always after the same pattern, and of the same  material. I am obliged to replace it when it can be used no longer,  simply to save him the trouble of asking for a new one. A queer fancy!  As a matter of fact, he has a thousand francs to spend every day, and  he does as he pleases, the dear child. And besides, I am so fond of him  that if he gave me a box on the ear on one side, I should hold out the  other to him! The most difficult things he will tell me to do, and yet I  do them, you know! He gives me a lot of trifles to attend to, that I  am well set to work! He reads the newspapers, doesn’t he? Well, my  instructions are to put them always in the same place, on the same  table. I always go at the same hour and shave him myself; and don’t I  tremble! The cook would forfeit the annuity of a thousand crowns that  he is to come into after my lord’s death, if breakfast is not served  _inconciliably_ at ten o’clock precisely. The menus are drawn up for the  whole year round, day after day. My Lord the Marquis has not a thing  to wish for. He has strawberries whenever there are any, and he has the  earliest mackerel to be had in Paris. The programme is printed every  morning. He knows his dinner by rote. In the next place, he dresses  himself at the same hour, in the same clothes, the same linen, that  I always put on the same chair, you understand? I have to see that he  always has the same cloth; and if it should happen that his coat came  to grief (a mere supposition), I should have to replace it by another  without saying a word about it to him. If it is fine, I go in and say to  my master:    “‘You ought to go out, sir.’    “He says Yes, or No. If he has a notion that he will go out, he doesn’t  wait for his horses; they are always ready harnessed; the coachman stops  there _inconciliably_, whip in hand, just as you see him out there.  In the evening, after dinner, my master goes one day to the Opera, the  other to the Ital----no, he hasn’t yet gone to the Italiens, though,  for I could not find a box for him until yesterday. Then he comes in at  eleven o’clock precisely, to go to bed. At any time in the day when  he has nothing to do, he reads--he is always reading, you see--it is a  notion he has. My instructions are to read the _Journal de la Librairie_  before he sees it, and to buy new books, so that he finds them on his  chimney-piece on the very day that they are published. I have orders to  go into his room every hour or so, to look after the fire and everything  else, and to see that he wants nothing. He gave me a little book, sir,  to learn off by heart, with all my duties written in it--a regular  catechism! In summer I have to keep a cool and even temperature with  blocks of ice and at all seasons to put fresh flowers all about. He is  rich! He has a thousand francs to spend every day; he can indulge his  fancies! And he hadn’t even necessaries for so long, poor child! He  doesn’t annoy anybody; he is as good as gold; he never opens his mouth,  for instance; the house and garden are absolutely silent. In short, my  master has not a single wish left; everything comes in the twinkling  of an eye, if he raises his hand, and _instanter_. Quite right, too.  If servants are not looked after, everything falls into confusion. You  would never believe the lengths he goes about things. His rooms are  all--what do you call it?--er--er--_en suite_. Very well; just suppose,  now, that he opens his room door or the door of his study; presto! all  the other doors fly open of themselves by a patent contrivance; and then  he can go from one end of the house to the other and not find a single  door shut; which is all very nice and pleasant and convenient for us  great folk! But, on my word, it cost us a lot of money! And, after all,  M. Porriquet, he said to me at last:    “‘Jonathan, you will look after me as if I were a baby in long clothes,’  Yes, sir, ‘long clothes!’ those were his very words. ‘You will think of  all my requirements for me.’ I am the master, so to speak, and he is  the servant, you understand? The reason of it? Ah, my word, that is just  what nobody on earth knows but himself and God Almighty. It is quite  _inconciliable_!”    “He is writing a poem!” exclaimed the old professor.    “You think he is writing a poem, sir? It’s a very absorbing affair,  then! But, you know, I don’t think he is. He often tells me that he  wants to live like a _vergetation_; he wants to _vergetate_. Only  yesterday he was looking at a tulip while he was dressing, and he said  to me:    “‘There is my own life--I am _vergetating_, my poor Jonathan.’ Now, some  of them insist that that is monomania. It is _inconciliable_!”    “All this makes it very clear to me, Jonathan,” the professor answered,  with a magisterial solemnity that greatly impressed the old servant,  “that your master is absorbed in a great work. He is deep in  vast meditations, and has no wish to be distracted by the petty  preoccupations of ordinary life. A man of genius forgets everything  among his intellectual labors. One day the famous Newton----”    “Newton?--oh, ah! I don’t know the name,” said Jonathan.    “Newton, a great geometrician,” Porriquet went on, “once sat for  twenty-four hours leaning his elbow on the table; when he emerged from  his musings, he was a day out in his reckoning, just as if he had been  sleeping. I will go to see him, dear lad; I may perhaps be of some use  to him.”    “Not for a moment!” Jonathan cried. “Not though you were King of  France--I mean the real old one. You could not go in unless you forced  the doors open and walked over my body. But I will go and tell him you  are here, M. Porriquet, and I will put it to him like this, ‘Ought he  to come up?’ And he will say Yes or No. I never say, ‘Do you wish?’  or ‘Will you?’ or ‘Do you want?’ Those words are scratched out of the  dictionary. He let out at me once with a ‘Do you want to kill me?’ he  was so very angry.”    Jonathan left the old schoolmaster in the vestibule, signing to him to  come no further, and soon returned with a favorable answer. He led the  old gentleman through one magnificent room after another, where every  door stood open. At last Porriquet beheld his pupil at some distance  seated beside the fire.    Raphael was reading the paper. He sat in an armchair wrapped in a  dressing-gown with some large pattern on it. The intense melancholy that  preyed upon him could be discerned in his languid posture and feeble  frame; it was depicted on his brow and white face; he looked like some  plant bleached by darkness. There was a kind of effeminate grace about  him; the fancies peculiar to wealthy invalids were also noticeable. His  hands were soft and white, like a pretty woman’s; he wore his fair hair,  now grown scanty, curled about his temples with a refinement of vanity.    The Greek cap that he wore was pulled to one side by the weight of its  tassel; too heavy for the light material of which it was made. He  had let the paper-knife fall at his feet, a malachite blade with gold  mounting, which he had used to cut the leaves of the book. The amber  mouthpiece of a magnificent Indian hookah lay on his knee; the enameled  coils lay like a serpent in the room, but he had forgotten to draw out  its fresh perfume. And yet there was a complete contradiction between  the general feebleness of his young frame and the blue eyes, where all  his vitality seemed to dwell; an extraordinary intelligence seemed to  look out from them and to grasp everything at once.    That expression was painful to see. Some would have read despair in  it, and others some inner conflict terrible as remorse. It was the  inscrutable glance of helplessness that must perforce consign its  desires to the depths of its own heart; or of a miser enjoying in  imagination all the pleasures that his money could procure for him,  while he declines to lessen his hoard; the look of a bound Prometheus,  of the fallen Napoleon of 1815, when he learned at the Elysee the  strategical blunder that his enemies had made, and asked for twenty-four  hours of command in vain; or rather it was the same look that Raphael  had turned upon the Seine, or upon his last piece of gold at the  gaming-table only a few months ago.    He was submitting his intelligence and his will to the homely  common-sense of an old peasant whom fifty years of domestic service had  scarcely civilized. He had given up all the rights of life in order to  live; he had despoiled his soul of all the romance that lies in a wish;  and almost rejoiced at thus becoming a sort of automaton. The better to  struggle with the cruel power that he had challenged, he had followed  Origen’s example, and had maimed and chastened his imagination.    The day after he had seen the diminution of the Magic Skin, at his  sudden accession of wealth, he happened to be at his notary’s house. A  well-known physician had told them quite seriously, at dessert, how  a Swiss attacked by consumption had cured himself. The man had never  spoken a word for ten years, and had compelled himself to draw six  breaths only, every minute, in the close atmosphere of a cow-house,  adhering all the time to a regimen of exceedingly light diet. “I will be  like that man,” thought Raphael to himself. He wanted life at any price,  and so he led the life of a machine in the midst of all the luxury  around him.    The old professor confronted this youthful corpse and shuddered; there  seemed something unnatural about the meagre, enfeebled frame. In the  Marquis, with his eager eyes and careworn forehead, he could hardly  recognize the fresh-cheeked and rosy pupil with the active limbs,  whom he remembered. If the worthy classicist, sage critic, and general  preserver of the traditions of correct taste had read Byron, he would  have thought that he had come on a Manfred when he looked to find Childe  Harold.    “Good day, pere Porriquet,” said Raphael, pressing the old  schoolmaster’s frozen fingers in his own damp ones; “how are you?”    “I am very well,” replied the other, alarmed by the touch of that  feverish hand. “But how about you?”    “Oh, I am hoping to keep myself in health.”    “You are engaged in some great work, no doubt?”    “No,” Raphael answered. “Exegi monumemtum, pere Porriquet; I have  contributed an important page to science, and have now bidden her  farewell for ever. I scarcely know where my manuscript is.”    “The style is no doubt correct?” queried the schoolmaster. “You, I hope,  would never have adopted the barbarous language of the new school, which  fancies it has worked such wonders by discovering Ronsard!”    “My work treats of physiology pure and simple.”    “Oh, then, there is no more to be said,” the schoolmaster answered.  “Grammar must yield to the exigencies of discovery. Nevertheless, young  man, a lucid and harmonious style--the diction of Massillon, of M. de  Buffon, of the great Racine--a classical style, in short, can never  spoil anything----But, my friend,” the schoolmaster interrupted  himself, “I was forgetting the object of my visit, which concerns my own  interests.”    Too late Raphael recalled to mind the verbose eloquence and elegant  circumlocutions which in a long professorial career had grown habitual  to his old tutor, and almost regretted that he had admitted him; but  just as he was about to wish to see him safely outside, he promptly  suppressed his secret desire with a stealthy glance at the Magic Skin.  It hung there before him, fastened down upon some white material,  surrounded by a red line accurately traced about its prophetic outlines.  Since that fatal carouse, Raphael had stifled every least whim, and  had lived so as not to cause the slightest movement in the terrible  talisman. The Magic Skin was like a tiger with which he must live  without exciting its ferocity. He bore patiently, therefore, with the  old schoolmaster’s prolixity.    Porriquet spent an hour in telling him about the persecutions directed  against him ever since the Revolution of July. The worthy man, having  a liking for strong governments, had expressed the patriotic wish that  grocers should be left to their counters, statesmen to the management of  public business, advocates to the Palais de Justice, and peers of France  to the Luxembourg; but one of the popularity-seeking ministers of the  Citizen King had ousted him from his chair, on an accusation of Carlism,  and the old man now found himself without pension or post, and with no  bread to eat. As he played the part of guardian angel to a poor nephew,  for whose schooling at Saint Sulpice he was paying, he came less on his  own account than for his adopted child’s sake, to entreat his former  pupil’s interest with the new minister. He did not ask to be reinstated,  but only for a position at the head of some provincial school.    QRaphael had fallen a victim to unconquerable drowsiness by the time  that the worthy man’s monotonous voice ceased to sound in his ears.  Civility had compelled him to look at the pale and unmoving eyes of  the deliberate and tedious old narrator, till he himself had reached  stupefaction, magnetized in an inexplicable way by the power of inertia.    “Well, my dear pere Porriquet,” he said, not very certain what the  question was to which he was replying, “but I can do nothing for you,  nothing at all. _I wish very heartily_ that you may succeed----”    All at once, without seeing the change wrought on the old man’s sallow  and wrinkled brow by these conventional phrases, full of indifference  and selfishness, Raphael sprang to his feet like a startled roebuck.  He saw a thin white line between the black piece of hide and the red  tracing about it, and gave a cry so fearful that the poor professor was  frightened by it.    “Old fool! Go!” he cried. “You will be appointed as headmaster! Couldn’t  you have asked me for an annuity of a thousand crowns rather than a  murderous wish? Your visit would have cost me nothing. There are a  hundred thousand situations to be had in France, but I have only  one life. A man’s life is worth more than all the situations in the  world.--Jonathan!”    Jonathan appeared.    “This is your doing, double-distilled idiot! What made you suggest  that I should see M. Porriquet?” and he pointed to the old man, who was  petrified with fright. “Did I put myself in your hands for you to tear  me in pieces? You have just shortened my life by ten years! Another  blunder of this kind, and you will lay me where I have laid my father.  Would I not far rather have possessed the beautiful Foedora? And I have  obliged that old hulk instead--that rag of humanity! I had money enough  for him. And, moreover, if all the Porriquets in the world were dying of  hunger, what is that to me?”    Raphael’s face was white with anger; a slight froth marked his trembling  lips; there was a savage gleam in his eyes. The two elders shook with  terror in his presence like two children at the sight of a snake. The  young man fell back in his armchair, a kind of reaction took place in  him, the tears flowed fast from his angry eyes.    “Oh, my life!” he cried, “that fair life of mine. Never to know a kindly  thought again, to love no more; nothing is left to me!”    He turned to the professor and went on in a gentle voice--“The harm  is done, my old friend. Your services have been well repaid; and my  misfortune has at any rate contributed to the welfare of a good and  worthy man.”    His tones betrayed so much feeling that the almost unintelligible  words drew tears from the two old men, such tears as are shed over some  pathetic song in a foreign tongue.    “He is epileptic,” muttered Porriquet.    “I understand your kind intentions, my friend,” Raphael answered  gently. “You would make excuses for me. Ill-health cannot be helped, but  ingratitude is a grievous fault. Leave me now,” he added. “To-morrow or  the next day, or possibly to-night, you will receive your appointment;  Resistance has triumphed over Motion. Farewell.”    The old schoolmaster went away, full of keen apprehension as to  Valentin’s sanity. A thrill of horror ran through him; there had been  something supernatural, he thought, in the scene he had passed through.  He could hardly believe his own impressions, and questioned them like  one awakened from a painful dream.    “Now attend to me, Jonathan,” said the young man to his old servant.  “Try to understand the charge confided to you.”    “Yes, my Lord Marquis.”    “I am as a man outlawed from humanity.”    “Yes, my Lord Marquis.”    “All the pleasures of life disport themselves round my bed of death,  and dance about me like fair women; but if I beckon to them, I must die.  Death always confronts me. You must be the barrier between the world and  me.”    “Yes, my Lord Marquis,” said the old servant, wiping the drops of  perspiration from his wrinkled forehead. “But if you don’t wish to  see pretty women, how will you manage at the Italiens this evening? An  English family is returning to London, and I have taken their box for  the rest of the season, and it is in a splendid position--superb; in the  first row.”    Raphael, deep in his own deep musings, paid no attention to him.    “Do you see that splendid equipage, a brougham painted a dark brown  color, but with the arms of an ancient and noble family shining from  the panels? As it rolls past, all the shop-girls admire it, and look  longingly at the yellow satin lining, the rugs from la Savonnerie,  the daintiness and freshness of every detail, the silken cushions and  tightly-fitting glass windows. Two liveried footmen are mounted behind  this aristocratic carriage; and within, a head lies back among  the silken cushions, the feverish face and hollow eyes of Raphael,  melancholy and sad. Emblem of the doom of wealth! He flies across Paris  like a rocket, and reaches the peristyle of the Theatre Favart. The  passers-by make way for him; the two footmen help him to alight, an  envious crowd looking on the while.”    “What has that fellow done to be so rich?” asks a poor law-student, who  cannot listen to the magical music of Rossini for lack of a five-franc  piece.    Raphael walked slowly along the gangway; he expected no enjoyment from  these pleasures he had once coveted so eagerly. In the interval before  the second act of Semiramide he walked up and down in the lobby, and  along the corridors, leaving his box, which he had not yet entered, to  look after itself. The instinct of property was dead within him already.  Like all invalids, he thought of nothing but his own sufferings. He was  leaning against the chimney-piece in the greenroom. A group had gathered  about it of dandies, young and old, of ministers, of peers without  peerages, and peerages without peers, for so the Revolution of July had  ordered matters. Among a host of adventurers and journalists, in fact,  Raphael beheld a strange, unearthly figure a few paces away among  the crowd. He went towards this grotesque object to see it better,  half-closing his eyes with exceeding superciliousness.    “What a wonderful bit of painting!” he said to himself. The stranger’s  hair and eyebrows and a Mazarin tuft on the chin had been dyed black,  but the result was a spurious, glossy, purple tint that varied its hues  according to the light; the hair had been too white, no doubt, to  take the preparation. Anxiety and cunning were depicted in the narrow,  insignificant face, with its wrinkles incrusted by thick layers of red  and white paint. This red enamel, lacking on some portions of his face,  strongly brought out his natural feebleness and livid hues. It was  impossible not to smile at this visage with the protuberant forehead  and pointed chin, a face not unlike those grotesque wooden figures that  German herdsmen carve in their spare moments.    An attentive observer looking from Raphael to this elderly Adonis would  have remarked a young man’s eyes set in a mask of age, in the case of  the Marquis, and in the other case the dim eyes of age peering forth  from behind a mask of youth. Valentin tried to recollect when and  where he had seen this little old man before. He was thin, fastidiously  cravatted, booted and spurred like one-and-twenty; he crossed his arms  and clinked his spurs as if he possessed all the wanton energy of  youth. He seemed to move about without constraint or difficulty. He  had carefully buttoned up his fashionable coat, which disguised his  powerful, elderly frame, and gave him the appearance of an antiquated  coxcomb who still follows the fashions.    For Raphael this animated puppet possessed all the interest of an  apparition. He gazed at it as if it had been some smoke-begrimed  Rembrandt, recently restored and newly framed. This idea found him a  clue to the truth among his confused recollections; he recognized the  dealer in antiquities, the man to whom he owed his calamities!    A noiseless laugh broke just then from the fantastical personage,  straightening the line of his lips that stretched across a row of  artificial teeth. That laugh brought out, for Raphael’s heated fancy, a  strong resemblance between the man before him and the type of head  that painters have assigned to Goethe’s Mephistopheles. A crowd  of superstitious thoughts entered Raphael’s sceptical mind; he  was convinced of the powers of the devil and of all the sorcerer’s  enchantments embodied in mediaeval tradition, and since worked up by  poets. Shrinking in horror from the destiny of Faust, he prayed for the  protection of Heaven with all the ardent faith of a dying man in God and  the Virgin. A clear, bright radiance seemed to give him a glimpse of  the heaven of Michael Angelo or of Raphael of Urbino: a venerable  white-bearded man, a beautiful woman seated in an aureole above the  clouds and winged cherub heads. Now he had grasped and received the  meaning of those imaginative, almost human creations; they seemed to  explain what had happened to him, to leave him yet one hope.    But when the greenroom of the Italiens returned upon his sight he  beheld, not the Virgin, but a very handsome young person. The execrable  Euphrasia, in all the splendor of her toilette, with its orient pearls,  had come thither, impatient for her ardent, elderly admirer. She was  insolently exhibiting herself with her defiant face and glittering  eyes to an envious crowd of stockbrokers, a visible testimony to the  inexhaustible wealth that the old dealer permitted her to squander.    Raphael recollected the mocking wish with which he had accepted the old  man’s luckless gift, and tasted all the sweets of revenge when he beheld  the spectacle of sublime wisdom fallen to such a depth as this,  wisdom for which such humiliation had seemed a thing impossible. The  centenarian greeted Euphrasia with a ghastly smile, receiving her  honeyed words in reply. He offered her his emaciated arm, and went  twice or thrice round the greenroom with her; the envious glances and  compliments with which the crowd received his mistress delighted him; he  did not see the scornful smiles, nor hear the caustic comments to which  he gave rise.    “In what cemetery did this young ghoul unearth that corpse of hers?”   asked a dandy of the Romantic faction.    Euphrasia began to smile. The speaker was a slender, fair-haired youth,  with bright blue eyes, and a moustache. His short dress coat, hat tilted  over one ear, and sharp tongue, all denoted the species.    “How many old men,” said Raphael to himself, “bring an upright,  virtuous, and hard-working life to a close in folly! His feet are cold  already, and he is making love.”    “Well, sir,” exclaimed Valentin, stopping the merchant’s progress, while  he stared hard at Euphrasia, “have you quite forgotten the stringent  maxims of your philosophy?”    “Ah, I am as happy now as a young man,” said the other, in a cracked  voice. “I used to look at existence from a wrong standpoint. One hour of  love has a whole life in it.”    The playgoers heard the bell ring, and left the greenroom to take their  places again. Raphael and the old merchant separated. As he entered  his box, the Marquis saw Foedora sitting exactly opposite to him on the  other side of the theatre. The Countess had probably only just come, for  she was just flinging off her scarf to leave her throat uncovered, and  was occupied with going through all the indescribable manoeuvres of a  coquette arranging herself. All eyes were turned upon her. A young peer  of France had come with her; she asked him for the lorgnette she had  given him to carry. Raphael knew the despotism to which his successor  had resigned himself, in her gestures, and in the way she treated her  companion. He was also under the spell no doubt, another dupe beating  with all the might of a real affection against the woman’s cold  calculations, enduring all the tortures from which Valentin had luckily  freed himself.    Foedora’s face lighted up with indescribable joy. After directing her  lorgnette upon every box in turn, to make a rapid survey of all the  dresses, she was conscious that by her toilette and her beauty she had  eclipsed the loveliest and best-dressed women in Paris. She laughed  to show her white teeth; her head with its wreath of flowers was never  still, in her quest of admiration. Her glances went from one box to  another, as she diverted herself with the awkward way in which a Russian  princess wore her bonnet, or over the utter failure of a bonnet with  which a banker’s daughter had disfigured herself.    All at once she met Raphael’s steady gaze and turned pale, aghast at the  intolerable contempt in her rejected lover’s eyes. Not one of her exiled  suitors had failed to own her power over them; Valentin alone was proof  against her attractions. A power that can be defied with impunity is  drawing to its end. This axiom is as deeply engraved on the heart of  woman as in the minds of kings. In Raphael, therefore, Foedora saw the  deathblow of her influence and her ability to please. An epigram of his,  made at the Opera the day before, was already known in the salons of  Paris. The biting edge of that terrible speech had already given the  Countess an incurable wound. We know how to cauterize a wound, but we  know of no treatment as yet for the stab of a phrase. As every other  woman in the house looked by turns at her and at the Marquis, Foedora  would have consigned them all to the oubliettes of some Bastille; for in  spite of her capacity for dissimulation, her discomfiture was discerned  by her rivals. Her unfailing consolation had slipped from her at last.  The delicious thought, “I am the most beautiful,” the thought that at  all times had soothed every mortification, had turned into a lie.    At the opening of the second act a woman took up her position not very  far from Raphael, in a box that had been empty hitherto. A murmur of  admiration went up from the whole house. In that sea of human faces  there was a movement of every living wave; all eyes were turned upon the  stranger lady. The applause of young and old was so prolonged, that when  the orchestra began, the musicians turned to the audience to request  silence, and then they themselves joined in the plaudits and swelled the  confusion. Excited talk began in every box, every woman equipped herself  with an opera glass, elderly men grew young again, and polished the  glasses of their lorgnettes with their gloves. The enthusiasm subsided  by degrees, the stage echoed with the voices of the singers, and order  reigned as before. The aristocratic section, ashamed of having yielded  to a spontaneous feeling, again assumed their wonted politely frigid  manner. The well-to-do dislike to be astonished at anything; at the  first sight of a beautiful thing it becomes their duty to discover the  defect in it which absolves them from admiring it,--the feeling of all  ordinary minds. Yet a few still remained motionless and heedless of the  music, artlessly absorbed in the delight of watching Raphael’s neighbor.    Valentin noticed Taillefer’s mean, obnoxious countenance by Aquilina’s  side in a lower box, and received an approving smirk from him. Then he  saw Emile, who seemed to say from where he stood in the orchestra, “Just  look at that lovely creature there, close beside you!” Lastly, he saw  Rastignac, with Mme. de Nucingen and her daughter, twisting his gloves  like a man in despair, because he was tethered to his place, and could  not leave it to go any nearer to the unknown fair divinity.    Raphael’s life depended upon a covenant that he had made with himself,  and had hitherto kept sacred. He would give no special heed to any  woman whatever; and the better to guard against temptation, he used  a cunningly contrived opera-glass which destroyed the harmony of the  fairest features by hideous distortions. He had not recovered from the  terror that had seized on him in the morning when, at a mere expression  of civility, the Magic Skin had contracted so abruptly. So Raphael was  determined not to turn his face in the direction of his neighbor. He sat  imperturbable as a duchess with his back against the corner of the box,  thereby shutting out half of his neighbor’s view of the stage, appearing  to disregard her, and even to be unaware that a pretty woman sat there  just behind him.    His neighbor copied Valentin’s position exactly; she leaned her elbow  on the edge of her box and turned her face in three-quarter profile upon  the singers on the stage, as if she were sitting to a painter. These  two people looked like two estranged lovers still sulking, still turning  their backs upon each other, who will go into each other’s arms at the  first tender word.    Now and again his neighbor’s ostrich feathers or her hair came in  contact with Raphael’s head, giving him a pleasurable thrill, against  which he sternly fought. In a little while he felt the touch of the  soft frill of lace that went round her dress; he could hear the gracious  sounds of the folds of her dress itself, light rustling noises full of  enchantment; he could even feel her movements as she breathed; with the  gentle stir thus imparted to her form and to her draperies, it seemed  to Raphael that all her being was suddenly communicated to him in  an electric spark. The lace and tulle that caressed him imparted  the delicious warmth of her bare, white shoulders. By a freak in  the ordering of things, these two creatures, kept apart by social  conventions, with the abysses of death between them, breathed together  and perhaps thought of one another. Finally, the subtle perfume of aloes  completed the work of Raphael’s intoxication. Opposition heated his  imagination, and his fancy, become the wilder for the limits imposed  upon it, sketched a woman for him in outlines of fire. He turned  abruptly, the stranger made a similar movement, startled no doubt at  being brought in contact with a stranger; and they remained face to  face, each with the same thought.    “Pauline!”    “M. Raphael!”    Each surveyed the other, both of them petrified with astonishment.  Raphael noticed Pauline’s daintily simple costume. A woman’s experienced  eyes would have discerned and admired the outlines beneath the modest  gauze folds of her bodice and the lily whiteness of her throat. And  then her more than mortal clearness of soul, her maidenly modesty, her  graceful bearing, all were unchanged. Her sleeve was quivering with  agitation, for the beating of her heart was shaking her whole frame.    “Come to the Hotel de Saint-Quentin to-morrow for your papers,” she  said. “I will be there at noon. Be punctual.”    She rose hastily, and disappeared. Raphael thought of following Pauline,  feared to compromise her, and stayed. He looked at Foedora; she seemed  to him positively ugly. Unable to understand a single phrase of the  music, and feeling stifled in the theatre, he went out, and returned  home with a full heart.    “Jonathan,” he said to the old servant, as soon as he lay in bed,  “give me half a drop of laudanum on a piece of sugar, and don’t wake me  to-morrow till twenty minutes to twelve.”    “I want Pauline to love me!” he cried next morning, looking at the  talisman the while in unspeakable anguish.    The skin did not move in the least; it seemed to have lost its power to  shrink; doubtless it could not fulfil a wish fulfilled already.    “Ah!” exclaimed Raphael, feeling as if a mantle of lead had fallen away,  which he had worn ever since the day when the talisman had been given to  him; “so you are playing me false, you are not obeying me, the pact is  broken! I am free; I shall live. Then was it all a wretched joke?” But  he did not dare to believe in his own thought as he uttered it.    He dressed himself as simply as had formerly been his wont, and set out  on foot for his old lodging, trying to go back in fancy to the happy  days when he abandoned himself without peril to vehement desires, the  days when he had not yet condemned all human enjoyment. As he walked  he beheld Pauline--not the Pauline of the Hotel Saint-Quentin, but the  Pauline of last evening. Here was the accomplished mistress he had so  often dreamed of, the intelligent young girl with the loving nature and  artistic temperament, who understood poets, who understood poetry, and  lived in luxurious surroundings. Here, in short, was Foedora,  gifted with a great soul; or Pauline become a countess, and twice a  millionaire, as Foedora had been. When he reached the worn threshold,  and stood upon the broken step at the door, where in the old days he had  had so many desperate thoughts, an old woman came out of the room within  and spoke to him.    “You are M. Raphael de Valentin, are you not?”    “Yes, good mother,” he replied.    “You know your old room then,” she replied; “you are expected up there.”    “Does Mme. Gaudin still own the house?” Raphael asked.    “Oh no, sir. Mme. Gaudin is a baroness now. She lives in a fine house  of her own on the other side of the river. Her husband has come back.  My goodness, he brought back thousands and thousands. They say she could  buy up all the Quartier Saint-Jacques if she liked. She gave me her  basement room for nothing, and the remainder of her lease. Ah, she’s  a kind woman all the same; she is no more proud to-day than she was  yesterday.”    Raphael hurried up the staircase to his garret; as he reached the last  few steps he heard the sounds of a piano. Pauline was there, simply  dressed in a cotton gown, but the way that it was made, like the gloves,  hat, and shawl that she had thrown carelessly upon the bed, revealed a  change of fortune.    “Ah, there you are!” cried Pauline, turning her head, and rising with  unconcealed delight.    Raphael went to sit beside her, flushed, confused, and happy; he looked  at her in silence.    “Why did you leave us then?” she asked, dropping her eyes as the flush  deepened on his face. “What became of you?”    “Ah, I have been very miserable, Pauline; I am very miserable still.”    “Alas!” she said, filled with pitying tenderness. “I guessed your fate  yesterday when I saw you so well dressed, and apparently so wealthy; but  in reality? Eh, M. Raphael, is it as it always used to be with you?”    Valentin could not restrain the tears that sprang to his eyes.    “Pauline,” he exclaimed, “I----”    He went no further, love sparkled in his eyes, and his emotion  overflowed his face.    “Oh, he loves me! he loves me!” cried Pauline.    Raphael felt himself unable to say one word; he bent his head. The young  girl took his hand at this; she pressed it as she said, half sobbing and  half laughing:--    “Rich, rich, happy and rich! Your Pauline is rich. But I? Oh, I ought  to be very poor to-day. I have said, times without number, that I would  give all the wealth upon this earth for those words, ‘He loves me!’ O  my Raphael! I have millions. You like luxury, you will be glad; but you  must love me and my heart besides, for there is so much love for you  in my heart. You don’t know? My father has come back. I am a wealthy  heiress. Both he and my mother leave me completely free to decide my own  fate. I am free--do you understand?”    Seized with a kind of frenzy, Raphael grasped Pauline’s hands and kissed  them eagerly and vehemently, with an almost convulsive caress. Pauline  drew her hands away, laid them on Raphael’s shoulders, and drew him  towards her. They understood one another--in that close embrace, in  the unalloyed and sacred fervor of that one kiss without an  afterthought--the first kiss by which two souls take possession of each  other.    “Ah, I will not leave you any more,” said Pauline, falling back in her  chair. “I do not know how I come to be so bold!” she added, blushing.    “Bold, my Pauline? Do not fear it. It is love, love true and deep and  everlasting like my own, is it not?”    “Speak!” she cried. “Go on speaking, so long your lips have been dumb  for me.”    “Then you have loved me all along?”    “Loved you? _Mon Dieu_! How often I have wept here, setting your room  straight, and grieving for your poverty and my own. I would have sold  myself to the evil one to spare you one vexation! You are MY Raphael  to-day, really my own Raphael, with that handsome head of yours, and  your heart is mine too; yes, that above all, your heart--O wealth  inexhaustible! Well, where was I?” she went on after a pause. “Oh yes!  We have three, four, or five millions, I believe. If I were poor, I  should perhaps desire to bear your name, to be acknowledged as your  wife; but as it is, I would give up the whole world for you, I would  be your servant still, now and always. Why, Raphael, if I give you my  fortune, my heart, myself to-day, I do no more than I did that day when  I put a certain five-franc piece in the drawer there,” and she pointed  to the table. “Oh, how your exultation hurt me then!”    “Oh, why are you rich?” Raphael cried; “why is there no vanity in you? I  can do nothing for you.”    He wrung his hands in despair and happiness and love.    “When you are the Marquise de Valentin, I know that the title and the  fortune for thee, heavenly soul, will not be worth----”    “One hair of your head,” she cried.    “I have millions too. But what is wealth to either of us now? There is  my life--ah, that I can offer, take it.”    “Your love, Raphael, your love is all the world to me. Are your thoughts  of me? I am the happiest of the happy!”    “Can any one overhear us?” asked Raphael.    “Nobody,” she replied, and a mischievous gesture escaped her.    “Come, then!” cried Valentin, holding out his arms.    She sprang upon his knees and clasped her arms about his neck.    “Kiss me!” she cried, “after all the pain you have given me; to blot out  the memory of the grief that your joys have caused me; and for the sake  of the nights that I spent in painting hand-screens----”    “Those hand-screens of yours?”    “Now that we are rich, my darling, I can tell you all about it. Poor  boy! how easy it is to delude a clever man! Could you have had white  waistcoats and clean shirts twice a week for three francs every month to  the laundress? Why, you used to drink twice as much milk as your money  would have paid for. I deceived you all round--over firing, oil, and  even money. O Raphael mine, don’t have me for your wife, I am far too  cunning!” she said laughing.    “But how did you manage?”    “I used to work till two o’clock in the morning; I gave my mother half  the money made by my screens, and the other half went to you.”    They looked at one another for a moment, both bewildered by love and  gladness.    “Some day we shall have to pay for this happiness by some terrible  sorrow,” cried Raphael.    “Perhaps you are married?” said Pauline. “Oh, I will not give you up to  any other woman.”    “I am free, my beloved.”    “Free!” she repeated. “Free, and mine!”    She slipped down upon her knees, clasped her hands, and looked at  Raphael in an enthusiasm of devotion.    “I am afraid I shall go mad. How handsome you are!” she went on, passing  her fingers through her lover’s fair hair. “How stupid your Countess  Foedora is! How pleased I was yesterday with the homage they all paid to  me! SHE has never been applauded. Dear, when I felt your arm against my  back, I heard a vague voice within me that cried, ‘He is there!’ and I  turned round and saw you. I fled, for I longed so to throw my arms about  you before them all.”    “How happy you are--you can speak!” Raphael exclaimed. “My heart is  overwhelmed; I would weep, but I cannot. Do not draw your hand away.  I could stay here looking at you like this for the rest of my life, I  think; happy and content.”    “O my love, say that once more!”    “Ah, what are words?” answered Valentin, letting a hot tear fall on  Pauline’s hands. “Some time I will try to tell you of my love; just now  I can only feel it.”    “You,” she said, “with your lofty soul and your great genius, with that  heart of yours that I know so well; are you really mine, as I am yours?”    “For ever and ever, my sweet creature,” said Raphael in an uncertain  voice. “You shall be my wife, my protecting angel. My griefs have always  been dispelled by your presence, and my courage revived; that angelic  smile now on your lips has purified me, so to speak. A new life seems  about to begin for me. The cruel past and my wretched follies are hardly  more to me than evil dreams. At your side I breathe an atmosphere of  happiness, and I am pure. Be with me always,” he added, pressing her  solemnly to his beating heart.    “Death may come when it will,” said Pauline in ecstasy; “I have lived!”    Happy he who shall divine their joy, for he must have experienced it.    “I wish that no one might enter this dear garret again, my Raphael,”   said Pauline, after two hours of silence.    “We must have the door walled up, put bars across the window, and buy  the house,” the Marquis answered.    “Yes, we will,” she said. Then a moment later she added: “Our search for  your manuscripts has been a little lost sight of,” and they both laughed  like children.    “Pshaw! I don’t care a jot for the whole circle of the sciences,”   Raphael answered.    “Ah, sir, and how about glory?”    “I glory in you alone.”    “You used to be very miserable as you made these little scratches and  scrawls,” she said, turning the papers over.    “My Pauline----”    “Oh yes, I am your Pauline--and what then?”    “Where are you living now?”    “In the Rue Saint Lazare. And you?”    “In the Rue de Varenne.”    “What a long way apart we shall be until----” She stopped, and looked at  her lover with a mischievous and coquettish expression.    “But at the most we need only be separated for a fortnight,” Raphael  answered.    “Really! we are to be married in a fortnight?” and she jumped for joy  like a child.    “I am an unnatural daughter!” she went on. “I give no more thought to my  father or my mother, or to anything in the world. Poor love, you don’t  know that my father is very ill? He returned from the Indies in very  bad health. He nearly died at Havre, where we went to find him. Good  heavens!” she cried, looking at her watch; “it is three o’clock already!  I ought to be back again when he wakes at four. I am mistress of the  house at home; my mother does everything that I wish, and my father  worships me; but I will not abuse their kindness, that would be wrong.  My poor father! He would have me go to the Italiens yesterday. You will  come to see him to-morrow, will you not?”    “Will Madame la Marquise de Valentin honor me by taking my arm?”    “I am going to take the key of this room away with me,” she said. “Isn’t  our treasure-house a palace?”    “One more kiss, Pauline.”    “A thousand, _mon Dieu_!” she said, looking at Raphael. “Will it always  be like this? I feel as if I were dreaming.”    They went slowly down the stairs together, step for step, with arms  closely linked, trembling both of them beneath their load of joy. Each  pressing close to the other’s side, like a pair of doves, they reached  the Place de la Sorbonne, where Pauline’s carriage was waiting.    “I want to go home with you,” she said. “I want to see your own room and  your study, and to sit at the table where you work. It will be like old  times,” she said, blushing.    She spoke to the servant. “Joseph, before returning home I am going to  the Rue de Varenne. It is a quarter-past three now, and I must be back  by four o’clock. George must hurry the horses.” And so in a few moments  the lovers came to Valentin’s abode.    “How glad I am to have seen all this for myself!” Pauline cried,  creasing the silken bed-curtains in Raphael’s room between her fingers.  “As I go to sleep, I shall be here in thought. I shall imagine your dear  head on the pillow there. Raphael, tell me, did no one advise you about  the furniture of your hotel?”    “No one whatever.”    “Really? It was not a woman who----”    “Pauline!”    “Oh, I know I am fearfully jealous. You have good taste. I will have a  bed like yours to-morrow.”    Quite beside himself with happiness, Raphael caught Pauline in his arms.    “Oh, my father!” she said; “my father----”    “I will take you back to him,” cried Valentin, “for I want to be away  from you as little as possible.”    “How loving you are! I did not venture to suggest it----”    “Are you not my life?”    It would be tedious to set down accurately the charming prattle of the  lovers, for tones and looks and gestures that cannot be rendered alone  gave it significance. Valentin went back with Pauline to her own door,  and returned with as much happiness in his heart as mortal man can know.    When he was seated in his armchair beside the fire, thinking over the  sudden and complete way in which his wishes had been fulfilled, a cold  shiver went through him, as if the blade of a dagger had been plunged  into his breast--he thought of the Magic Skin, and saw that it had  shrunk a little. He uttered the most tremendous of French oaths, without  any of the Jesuitical reservations made by the Abbess of Andouillettes,  leant his head against the back of the chair, and sat motionless, fixing  his unseeing eyes upon the bracket of the curtain pole.    “Good God!” he cried; “every wish! Every desire of mine! Poor  Pauline!----”    He took a pair of compasses and measured the extent of existence that  the morning had cost him.    “I have scarcely enough for two months!” he said.    A cold sweat broke out over him; moved by an ungovernable spasm of rage,  he seized the Magic Skin, exclaiming:    “I am a perfect fool!”    He rushed out of the house and across the garden, and flung the talisman  down a well.    “_Vogue la galere_,” cried he. “The devil take all this nonsense.”    So Raphael gave himself up to the happiness of being beloved, and led  with Pauline the life of heart and heart. Difficulties which it would  be somewhat tedious to describe had delayed their marriage, which was to  take place early in March. Each was sure of the other; their affection  had been tried, and happiness had taught them how strong it was. Never  has love made two souls, two natures, so absolutely one. The more they  came to know of each other, the more they loved. On either side there  was the same hesitating delicacy, the same transports of joy such as  angels know; there were no clouds in their heaven; the will of either  was the other’s law.    Wealthy as they both were, they had not a caprice which they could not  gratify, and for that reason had no caprices. A refined taste, a feeling  for beauty and poetry, was instinct in the soul of the bride; her  lover’s smile was more to her than all the pearls of Ormuz. She  disdained feminine finery; a muslin dress and flowers formed her most  elaborate toilette.    Pauline and Raphael shunned every one else, for solitude was abundantly  beautiful to them. The idlers at the Opera, or at the Italiens, saw this  charming and unconventional pair evening after evening. Some gossip  went the round of the salons at first, but the harmless lovers were  soon forgotten in the course of events which took place in Paris; their  marriage was announced at length to excuse them in the eyes of the  prudish; and as it happened, their servants did not babble; so their  bliss did not draw down upon them any very severe punishment.    One morning towards the end of February, at the time when the  brightening days bring a belief in the nearness of the joys of spring,  Pauline and Raphael were breakfasting together in a small conservatory,  a kind of drawing-room filled with flowers, on a level with the garden.  The mild rays of the pale winter sunlight, breaking through the thicket  of exotic plants, warmed the air somewhat. The vivid contrast made by  the varieties of foliage, the colors of the masses of flowering shrubs,  the freaks of light and shadow, gladdened the eyes. While all the rest  of Paris still sought warmth from its melancholy hearth, these two were  laughing in a bower of camellias, lilacs, and blossoming heath. Their  happy faces rose above lilies of the valley, narcissus blooms, and  Bengal roses. A mat of plaited African grass, variegated like a carpet,  lay beneath their feet in this luxurious conservatory. The walls,  covered with a green linen material, bore no traces of damp. The  surfaces of the rustic wooden furniture shone with cleanliness. A  kitten, attracted by the odor of milk, had established itself upon the  table; it allowed Pauline to bedabble it in coffee; she was playing  merrily with it, taking away the cream that she had just allowed the  kitten to sniff at, so as to exercise its patience, and keep up the  contest. She burst out laughing at every antic, and by the comical  remarks she constantly made, she hindered Raphael from perusing the  paper; he had dropped it a dozen times already. This morning picture  seemed to overflow with inexpressible gladness, like everything that is  natural and genuine.    Raphael, still pretending to read his paper, furtively watched Pauline  with the cat--his Pauline, in the dressing-gown that hung carelessly  about her; his Pauline, with her hair loose on her shoulders, with a  tiny, white, blue-veined foot peeping out of a velvet slipper. It was  pleasant to see her in this negligent dress; she was delightful as some  fanciful picture by Westall; half-girl, half-woman, as she seemed to  be, or perhaps more of a girl than a woman, there was no alloy in  the happiness she enjoyed, and of love she knew as yet only its first  ecstasy. When Raphael, absorbed in happy musing, had forgotten the  existence of the newspaper, Pauline flew upon it, crumpled it up into  a ball, and threw it out into the garden; the kitten sprang after the  rotating object, which spun round and round, as politics are wont to do.  This childish scene recalled Raphael to himself. He would have gone on  reading, and felt for the sheet he no longer possessed. Joyous laughter  rang out like the song of a bird, one peal leading to another.    “I am quite jealous of the paper,” she said, as she wiped away the tears  that her childlike merriment had brought into her eyes. “Now, is it not  a heinous offence,” she went on, as she became a woman all at once, “to  read Russian proclamations in my presence, and to attend to the prosings  of the Emperor Nicholas rather than to looks and words of love!”    “I was not reading, my dear angel; I was looking at you.”    Just then the gravel walk outside the conservatory rang with the sound  of the gardener’s heavily nailed boots.    “I beg your pardon, my Lord Marquis--and yours, too, madame--if I am  intruding, but I have brought you a curiosity the like of which I never  set eyes on. Drawing a bucket of water just now, with due respect, I  got out this strange salt-water plant. Here it is. It must be thoroughly  used to water, anyhow, for it isn’t saturated or even damp at all. It is  as dry as a piece of wood, and has not swelled a bit. As my Lord Marquis  certainly knows a great deal more about things than I do, I thought I  ought to bring it, and that it would interest him.”    Therewith the gardener showed Raphael the inexorable piece of skin;  there were barely six square inches of it left.    “Thanks, Vaniere,” Raphael said. “The thing is very curious.”    “What is the matter with you, my angel; you are growing quite white!”   Pauline cried.    “You can go, Vaniere.”    “Your voice frightens me,” the girl went on; “it is so strangely  altered. What is it? How are you feeling? Where is the pain? You are in  pain!--Jonathan! here! call a doctor!” she cried.    “Hush, my Pauline,” Raphael answered, as he regained composure. “Let us  get up and go. Some flower here has a scent that is too much for me. It  is that verbena, perhaps.”    Pauline flew upon the innocent plant, seized it by the stalk, and flung  it out into the garden; then, with all the might of the love between  them, she clasped Raphael in a close embrace, and with languishing  coquetry raised her red lips to his for a kiss.    “Dear angel,” she cried, “when I saw you turn so white, I understood  that I could not live on without you; your life is my life too. Lay your  hand on my back, Raphael mine; I feel a chill like death. The feeling  of cold is there yet. Your lips are burning. How is your hand?--Cold as  ice,” she added.    “Mad girl!” exclaimed Raphael.    “Why that tear? Let me drink it.”    “O Pauline, Pauline, you love me far too much!”    “There is something very extraordinary going on in your mind, Raphael!  Do not dissimulate. I shall very soon find out your secret. Give that to  me,” she went on, taking the Magic Skin.    “You are my executioner!” the young man exclaimed, glancing in horror at  the talisman.    “How changed your voice is!” cried Pauline, as she dropped the fatal  symbol of destiny.    “Do you love me?” he asked.    “Do I love you? Is there any doubt?”    “Then, leave me, go away!”    The poor child went.    “So!” cried Raphael, when he was alone. “In an enlightened age, when we  have found out that diamonds are a crystallized form of charcoal, at  a time when everything is made clear, when the police would hale a new  Messiah before the magistrates, and submit his miracles to the Academie  des Sciences--in an epoch when we no longer believe in anything but a  notary’s signature--that I, forsooth, should believe in a sort of _Mene,  Tekel, Upharsin_! No, by Heaven, I will not believe that the Supreme  Being would take pleasure in torturing a harmless creature.--Let us see  the learned about it.”    Between the Halle des Vins, with its extensive assembly of barrels, and  the Salpetriere, that extensive seminary of drunkenness, lies a small  pond, which Raphael soon reached. All sorts of ducks of rare varieties  were there disporting themselves; their colored markings shone in the  sun like the glass in cathedral windows. Every kind of duck in the  world was represented, quacking, dabbling, and moving about--a kind  of parliament of ducks assembled against its will, but luckily without  either charter or political principles, living in complete immunity from  sportsmen, under the eyes of any naturalist that chanced to see them.    “That is M. Lavrille,” said one of the keepers to Raphael, who had asked  for that high priest of zoology.    The Marquis saw a short man buried in profound reflections, caused by  the appearance of a pair of ducks. The man of science was middle-aged;  he had a pleasant face, made pleasanter still by a kindly expression,  but an absorption in scientific ideas engrossed his whole person. His  peruke was strangely turned up, by being constantly raised to scratch  his head; so that a line of white hair was left plainly visible, a  witness to an enthusiasm for investigation, which, like every other  strong passion, so withdraws us from mundane considerations, that we  lose all consciousness of the “I” within us. Raphael, the student and  man of science, looked respectfully at the naturalist, who devoted his  nights to enlarging the limits of human knowledge, and whose very errors  reflected glory upon France; but a she-coxcomb would have laughed,  no doubt, at the break of continuity between the breeches and striped  waistcoat worn by the man of learning; the interval, moreover, was  modestly filled by a shirt which had been considerably creased, for  he stooped and raised himself by turns, as his zoological observations  required.    After the first interchange of civilities, Raphael thought it necessary  to pay M. Lavrille a banal compliment upon his ducks.    “Oh, we are well off for ducks,” the naturalist replied. “The genus,  moreover, as you doubtless know, is the most prolific in the order  of palmipeds. It begins with the swan and ends with the zin-zin duck,  comprising in all one hundred and thirty-seven very distinct varieties,  each having its own name, habits, country, and character, and every one  no more like another than a white man is like a negro. Really, sir,  when we dine off a duck, we have no notion for the most part of the vast  extent----”    He interrupted himself as he saw a small pretty duck come up to the  surface of the pond.    “There you see the cravatted swan, a poor native of Canada; he has come  a very long way to show us his brown and gray plumage and his little  black cravat! Look, he is preening himself. That one is the famous eider  duck that provides the down, the eider-down under which our fine ladies  sleep; isn’t it pretty? Who would not admire the little pinkish white  breast and the green beak? I have just been a witness, sir,” he went on,  “to a marriage that I had long despaired of bringing about; they have  paired rather auspiciously, and I shall await the results very eagerly.  This will be a hundred and thirty-eighth species, I flatter myself, to  which, perhaps, my name will be given. That is the newly matched pair,”   he said, pointing out two of the ducks; “one of them is a laughing goose  (_anas albifrons_), and the other the great whistling duck, Buffon’s  _anas ruffina_. I have hesitated a long while between the whistling  duck, the duck with white eyebrows, and the shoveler duck (_anas  clypeata_). Stay, that is the shoveler--that fat, brownish black rascal,  with the greenish neck and that coquettish iridescence on it. But the  whistling duck was a crested one, sir, and you will understand that I  deliberated no longer. We only lack the variegated black-capped duck  now. These gentlemen here, unanimously claim that that variety of  duck is only a repetition of the curve-beaked teal, but for my own  part,”--and the gesture he made was worth seeing. It expressed at once  the modesty and pride of a man of science; the pride full of obstinacy,  and the modesty well tempered with assurance.    “I don’t think it is,” he added. “You see, my dear sir, that we are not  amusing ourselves here. I am engaged at this moment upon a monograph on  the genus duck. But I am at your disposal.”    While they went towards a rather pleasant house in the Rue du Buffon,  Raphael submitted the skin to M. Lavrille’s inspection.    “I know the product,” said the man of science, when he had turned his  magnifying glass upon the talisman. “It used to be used for covering  boxes. The shagreen is very old. They prefer to use skate’s skin  nowadays for making sheaths. This, as you are doubtless aware, is the  hide of the _raja sephen_, a Red Sea fish.”    “But this, sir, since you are so exceedingly good----”    “This,” the man of science interrupted, as he resumed, “this is quite  another thing; between these two shagreens, sir, there is a difference  just as wide as between sea and land, or fish and flesh. The fish’s skin  is harder, however, than the skin of the land animal. This,” he said, as  he indicated the talisman, “is, as you doubtless know, one of the most  curious of zoological products.”    “But to proceed----” said Raphael.    “This,” replied the man of science, as he flung himself down into his  armchair, “is an ass’ skin, sir.”    “Yes, I know,” said the young man.    “A very rare variety of ass found in Persia,” the naturalist continued,  “the onager of the ancients, equus asinus, the _koulan_ of the Tartars;  Pallas went out there to observe it, and has made it known to science,  for as a matter of fact the animal for a long time was believed to be  mythical. It is mentioned, as you know, in Holy Scripture; Moses forbade  that it should be coupled with its own species, and the onager is yet  more famous for the prostitutions of which it was the object, and which  are often mentioned by the prophets of the Bible. Pallas, as you know  doubtless, states in his _Act. Petrop._ tome II., that these bizarre  excesses are still devoutly believed in among the Persians and the  Nogais as a sovereign remedy for lumbago and sciatic gout. We poor  Parisians scarcely believe that. The Museum has no example of the  onager.    “What a magnificent animal!” he continued. “It is full of mystery;  its eyes are provided with a sort of burnished covering, to which the  Orientals attribute the powers of fascination; it has a glossier and  finer coat than our handsomest horses possess, striped with more or less  tawny bands, very much like the zebra’s hide. There is something pliant  and silky about its hair, which is sleek to the touch. Its powers of  sight vie in precision and accuracy with those of man; it is rather  larger than our largest domestic donkeys, and is possessed of  extraordinary courage. If it is surprised by any chance, it defends  itself against the most dangerous wild beasts with remarkable success;  the rapidity of its movements can only be compared with the flight of  birds; an onager, sir, would run the best Arab or Persian horses to  death. According to the father of the conscientious Doctor Niebuhr,  whose recent loss we are deploring, as you doubtless know, the ordinary  average pace of one of these wonderful creatures would be seven thousand  geometric feet per hour. Our own degenerate race of donkeys can give no  idea of the ass in his pride and independence. He is active and spirited  in his demeanor; he is cunning and sagacious; there is grace about the  outlines of his head; every movement is full of attractive charm. In  the East he is the king of beasts. Turkish and Persian superstition even  credits him with a mysterious origin; and when stories of the prowess  attributed to him are told in Thibet or in Tartary, the speakers mingle  Solomon’s name with that of this noble animal. A tame onager, in short,  is worth an enormous amount; it is well-nigh impossible to catch them  among the mountains, where they leap like roebucks, and seem as if they  could fly like birds. Our myth of the winged horse, our Pegasus, had its  origin doubtless in these countries, where the shepherds could see the  onager springing from one rock to another. In Persia they breed asses  for the saddle, a cross between a tamed onager and a she-ass, and they  paint them red, following immemorial tradition. Perhaps it was this  custom that gave rise to our own proverb, ‘Surely as a red donkey.’ At  some period when natural history was much neglected in France, I think a  traveler must have brought over one of these strange beasts that endures  servitude with such impatience. Hence the adage. The skin that you  have laid before me is the skin of an onager. Opinions differ as to the  origin of the name. Some claim that _Chagri_ is a Turkish word; others  insist that _Chagri_ must be the name of the place where this animal  product underwent the chemical process of preparation so clearly  described by Pallas, to which the peculiar graining that we admire is  due; Martellens has written to me saying that _Chaagri_ is a river----”    “I thank you, sir, for the information that you have given me; it would  furnish an admirable footnote for some Dom Calmet or other, if such  erudite hermits yet exist; but I have had the honor of pointing out to  you that this scrap was in the first instance quite as large as that  map,” said Raphael, indicating an open atlas to Lavrille; “but it has  shrunk visibly in three months’ time----”    “Quite so,” said the man of science. “I understand. The remains of any  substance primarily organic are naturally subject to a process of  decay. It is quite easy to understand, and its progress depends upon  atmospherical conditions. Even metals contract and expand appreciably,  for engineers have remarked somewhat considerable interstices between  great blocks of stone originally clamped together with iron bars. The  field of science is boundless, but human life is very short, so that we  do not claim to be acquainted with all the phenomena of nature.”    “Pardon the question that I am about to ask you, sir,” Raphael began,  half embarrassed, “but are you quite sure that this piece of skin is  subject to the ordinary laws of zoology, and that it can be stretched?”    “Certainly----oh, bother!----” muttered M. Lavrille, trying to stretch  the talisman. “But if you, sir, will go to see Planchette,” he added,  “the celebrated professor of mechanics, he will certainly discover some  method of acting upon this skin, of softening and expanding it.”    “Ah, sir, you are the preserver of my life,” and Raphael took leave of  the learned naturalist and hurried off to Planchette, leaving the worthy  Lavrille in his study, all among the bottles and dried plants that  filled it up.    Quite unconsciously Raphael brought away with him from this visit,  all of science that man can grasp, a terminology to wit. Lavrille, the  worthy man, was very much like Sancho Panza giving to Don Quixote the  history of the goats; he was entertaining himself by making out a list  of animals and ticking them off. Even now that his life was nearing its  end, he was scarcely acquainted with a mere fraction of the countless  numbers of the great tribes that God has scattered, for some unknown  end, throughout the ocean of worlds.    Raphael was well pleased. “I shall keep my ass well in hand,” cried he.  Sterne had said before his day, “Let us take care of our ass, if we wish  to live to old age.” But it is such a fantastic brute!    Planchette was a tall, thin man, a poet of a surety, lost in one  continual thought, and always employed in gazing into the bottomless  abyss of Motion. Commonplace minds accuse these lofty intellects of  madness; they form a misinterpreted race apart that lives in a wonderful  carelessness of luxuries or other people’s notions. They will spend  whole days at a stretch, smoking a cigar that has gone out, and enter  a drawing-room with the buttons on their garments not in every case  formally wedded to the button-holes. Some day or other, after a long  time spent in measuring space, or in accumulating Xs under Aa-Gg, they  succeed in analyzing some natural law, and resolve it into its elemental  principles, and all on a sudden the crowd gapes at a new machine; or it  is a handcart perhaps that overwhelms us with astonishment by the apt  simplicity of its construction. The modest man of science smiles at  his admirers, and remarks, “What is that invention of mine? Nothing  whatever. Man cannot create a force; he can but direct it; and science  consists in learning from nature.”    The mechanician was standing bolt upright, planted on both feet, like  some victim dropped straight from the gibbet, when Raphael broke in upon  him. He was intently watching an agate ball that rolled over a sun-dial,  and awaited its final settlement. The worthy man had received neither  pension nor decoration; he had not known how to make the right use of  his ability for calculation. He was happy in his life spent on the watch  for a discovery; he had no thought either of reputation, of the outer  world, nor even of himself, and led the life of science for the sake of  science.    “It is inexplicable,” he exclaimed. “Ah, your servant, sir,” he went on,  becoming aware of Raphael’s existence. “How is your mother? You must go  and see my wife.”    “And I also could have lived thus,” thought Raphael, as he recalled the  learned man from his meditations by asking of him how to produce any  effect on the talisman, which he placed before him.    “Although my credulity must amuse you, sir,” so the Marquis ended, “I  will conceal nothing from you. That skin seems to me to be endowed with  an insuperable power of resistance.”    “People of fashion, sir, always treat science rather superciliously,”   said Planchette. “They all talk to us pretty much as the _incroyable_  did when he brought some ladies to see Lalande just after an eclipse,  and remarked, ‘Be so good as to begin it over again!’ What effect do you  want to produce? The object of the science of mechanics is either the  application or the neutralization of the laws of motion. As for motion  pure and simple, I tell you humbly, that we cannot possibly define it.  That disposed of, unvarying phenomena have been observed which accompany  the actions of solids and fluids. If we set up the conditions by  which these phenomena are brought to pass, we can transport bodies or  communicate locomotive power to them at a predetermined rate of speed.  We can project them, divide them up in a few or an infinite number of  pieces, accordingly as we break them or grind them to powder; we can  twist bodies or make them rotate, modify, compress, expand, or extend  them. The whole science, sir, rests upon a single fact.    “You see this ball,” he went on; “here it lies upon this slab. Now,  it is over there. What name shall we give to what has taken place,  so natural from a physical point of view, so amazing from a moral?  Movement, locomotion, changing of place? What prodigious vanity lurks  underneath the words. Does a name solve the difficulty? Yet it is the  whole of our science for all that. Our machines either make direct use  of this agency, this fact, or they convert it. This trifling phenomenon,  applied to large masses, would send Paris flying. We can increase speed  by an expenditure of force, and augment the force by an increase of  speed. But what are speed and force? Our science is as powerless to tell  us that as to create motion. Any movement whatever is an immense power,  and man does not create power of any kind. Everything is movement,  thought itself is a movement, upon movement nature is based. Death is a  movement whose limitations are little known. If God is eternal, be  sure that He moves perpetually; perhaps God is movement. That is  why movement, like God is inexplicable, unfathomable, unlimited,  incomprehensible, intangible. Who has ever touched, comprehended, or  measured movement? We feel its effects without seeing it; we can even  deny them as we can deny the existence of a God. Where is it? Where  is it not? Whence comes it? What is its source? What is its end? It  surrounds us, it intrudes upon us, and yet escapes us. It is evident as  a fact, obscure as an abstraction; it is at once effect and cause. It  requires space, even as we, and what is space? Movement alone recalls  it to us; without movement, space is but an empty meaningless word.  Like space, like creation, like the infinite, movement is an insoluble  problem which confounds human reason; man will never conceive it,  whatever else he may be permitted to conceive.    “Between each point in space occupied in succession by that ball,”   continued the man of science, “there is an abyss confronting human  reason, an abyss into which Pascal fell. In order to produce any  effect upon an unknown substance, we ought first of all to study that  substance; to know whether, in accordance with its nature, it will be  broken by the force of a blow, or whether it will withstand it; if it  breaks in pieces, and you have no wish to split it up, we shall not  achieve the end proposed. If you want to compress it, a uniform impulse  must be communicated to all the particles of the substance, so as to  diminish the interval that separates them in an equal degree. If you  wish to expand it, we should try to bring a uniform eccentric force to  bear on every molecule; for unless we conform accurately to this law,  we shall have breaches in continuity. The modes of motion, sir, are  infinite, and no limit exists to combinations of movement. Upon what  effect have you determined?”    “I want any kind of pressure that is strong enough to expand the skin  indefinitely,” began Raphael, quite of out patience.    “Substance is finite,” the mathematician put in, “and therefore will not  admit of indefinite expansion, but pressure will necessarily increase  the extent of surface at the expense of the thickness, which will be  diminished until the point is reached when the material gives out----”    “Bring about that result, sir,” Raphael cried, “and you will have earned  millions.”    “Then I should rob you of your money,” replied the other, phlegmatic as  a Dutchman. “I am going to show you, in a word or two, that a machine  can be made that is fit to crush Providence itself in pieces like a fly.  It would reduce a man to the conditions of a piece of waste paper; a  man--boots and spurs, hat and cravat, trinkets and gold, and all----”    “What a fearful machine!”    “Instead of flinging their brats into the water, the Chinese ought  to make them useful in this way,” the man of science went on, without  reflecting on the regard man has for his progeny.    Quite absorbed by his idea, Planchette took an empty flower-pot, with a  hole in the bottom, and put it on the surface of the dial, then he  went to look for a little clay in a corner of the garden. Raphael stood  spellbound, like a child to whom his nurse is telling some wonderful  story. Planchette put the clay down upon the slab, drew a pruning-knife  from his pocket, cut two branches from an elder tree, and began to  clean them of pith by blowing through them, as if Raphael had not been  present.    “There are the rudiments of the apparatus,” he said. Then he connected  one of the wooden pipes with the bottom of the flower-pot by way of  a clay joint, in such a way that the mouth of the elder stem was just  under the hole of the flower-pot; you might have compared it to a big  tobacco-pipe. He spread a bed of clay over the surface of the slab, in a  shovel-shaped mass, set down the flower-pot at the wider end of it, and  laid the pipe of the elder stem along the portion which represented the  handle of the shovel. Next he put a lump of clay at the end of the elder  stem and therein planted the other pipe, in an upright position, forming  a second elbow which connected it with the first horizontal pipe in such  a manner that the air, or any given fluid in circulation, could flow  through this improvised piece of mechanism from the mouth of the  vertical tube, along the intermediate passages, and so into the large  empty flower-pot.    “This apparatus, sir,” he said to Raphael, with all the gravity of an  academician pronouncing his initiatory discourse, “is one of the great  Pascal’s grandest claims upon our admiration.”    “I don’t understand.”    The man of science smiled. He went up to a fruit-tree and took down a  little phial in which the druggist had sent him some liquid for catching  ants; he broke off the bottom and made a funnel of the top, carefully  fitting it to the mouth of the vertical hollowed stem that he had set in  the clay, and at the opposite end to the great reservoir, represented  by the flower-pot. Next, by means of a watering-pot, he poured in  sufficient water to rise to the same level in the large vessel and in  the tiny circular funnel at the end of the elder stem.    Raphael was thinking of his piece of skin.    “Water is considered to-day, sir, to be an incompressible body,” said  the mechanician; “never lose sight of that fundamental principle; still  it can be compressed, though only so very slightly that we should regard  its faculty for contracting as a zero. You see the amount of surface  presented by the water at the brim of the flower-pot?”    “Yes, sir.”    “Very good; now suppose that that surface is a thousand times larger  than the orifice of the elder stem through which I poured the liquid.  Here, I am taking the funnel away----”    “Granted.”    “Well, then, if by any method whatever I increase the volume of that  quantity of water by pouring in yet more through the mouth of the little  tube; the water thus compelled to flow downwards would rise in the  reservoir, represented by the flower-pot, until it reached the same  level at either end.”    “That is quite clear,” cried Raphael.    “But there is this difference,” the other went on. “Suppose that the  thin column of water poured into the little vertical tube there exerts  a force equal, say, to a pound weight, for instance, its action will  be punctually communicated to the great body of the liquid, and will be  transmitted to every part of the surface represented by the water in the  flower-pot so that at the surface there will be a thousand columns of  water, every one pressing upwards as if they were impelled by a force  equal to that which compels the liquid to descend in the vertical tube;  and of necessity they reproduce here,” said Planchette, indicating to  Raphael the top of the flower-pot, “the force introduced over there, a  thousand-fold,” and the man of science pointed out to the marquis the  upright wooden pipe set in the clay.    “That is quite simple,” said Raphael.    Planchette smiled again.    “In other words,” he went on, with the mathematician’s natural stubborn  propensity for logic, “in order to resist the force of the incoming  water, it would be necessary to exert, upon every part of the large  surface, a force equal to that brought into action in the vertical  column, but with this difference--if the column of liquid is a foot in  height, the thousand little columns of the wide surface will only have a  very slight elevating power.    “Now,” said Planchette, as he gave a fillip to his bits of stick,  “let us replace this funny little apparatus by steel tubes of suitable  strength and dimensions; and if you cover the liquid surface of the  reservoir with a strong sliding plate of metal, and if to this metal  plate you oppose another, solid enough and strong enough to resist any  test; if, furthermore, you give me the power of continually adding water  to the volume of liquid contents by means of the little vertical tube,  the object fixed between the two solid metal plates must of necessity  yield to the tremendous crushing force which indefinitely compresses it.  The method of continually pouring in water through a little tube, like  the manner of communicating force through the volume of the liquid to a  small metal plate, is an absurdly primitive mechanical device. A brace  of pistons and a few valves would do it all. Do you perceive, my dear  sir,” he said taking Valentin by the arm, “there is scarcely a substance  in existence that would not be compelled to dilate when fixed in between  these two indefinitely resisting surfaces?”    “What! the author of the _Lettres provinciales_ invented it?” Raphael  exclaimed.    “He and no other, sir. The science of mechanics knows no simpler nor  more beautiful contrivance. The opposite principle, the capacity of  expansion possessed by water, has brought the steam-engine into  being. But water will only expand up to a certain point, while its  incompressibility, being a force in a manner negative, is, of necessity,  infinite.”    “If this skin is expanded,” said Raphael, “I promise you to erect a  colossal statue to Blaise Pascal; to found a prize of a hundred thousand  francs to be offered every ten years for the solution of the grandest  problem of mechanical science effected during the interval; to find  dowries for all your cousins and second cousins, and finally to build an  asylum on purpose for impoverished or insane mathematicians.”    “That would be exceedingly useful,” Planchette replied. “We will go to  Spieghalter to-morrow, sir,” he continued, with the serenity of a man  living on a plane wholly intellectual. “That distinguished mechanic has  just completed, after my own designs, an improved mechanical arrangement  by which a child could get a thousand trusses of hay inside his cap.”    “Then good-bye till to-morrow.”    “Till to-morrow, sir.”    “Talk of mechanics!” cried Raphael; “isn’t it the greatest of the  sciences? The other fellow with his onagers, classifications, ducks, and  species, and his phials full of bottled monstrosities, is at best only  fit for a billiard-marker in a saloon.”    The next morning Raphael went off in great spirits to find Planchette,  and together they set out for the Rue de la Sante--auspicious  appellation! Arrived at Spieghalter’s, the young man found himself in a  vast foundry; his eyes lighted upon a multitude of glowing and roaring  furnaces. There was a storm of sparks, a deluge of nails, an ocean  of pistons, vices, levers, valves, girders, files, and nuts; a sea of  melted metal, baulks of timber and bar-steel. Iron filings filled your  throat. There was iron in the atmosphere; the men were covered with it;  everything reeked of iron. The iron seemed to be a living organism; it  became a fluid, moved, and seemed to shape itself intelligently after  every fashion, to obey the worker’s every caprice. Through the uproar  made by the bellows, the crescendo of the falling hammers, and the  shrill sounds of the lathes that drew groans from the steel, Raphael  passed into a large, clean, and airy place where he was able to inspect  at his leisure the great press that Planchette had told him about. He  admired the cast-iron beams, as one might call them, and the twin bars  of steel coupled together with indestructible bolts.    “If you were to give seven rapid turns to that crank,” said Spieghalter,  pointing out a beam of polished steel, “you would make a steel bar spurt  out in thousands of jets, that would get into your legs like needles.”    “The deuce!” exclaimed Raphael.    Planchette himself slipped the piece of skin between the metal plates  of the all-powerful press; and, brimful of the certainty of a scientific  conviction, he worked the crank energetically.    “Lie flat, all of you; we are dead men!” thundered Spieghalter, as he  himself fell prone on the floor.    A hideous shrieking sound rang through the workshops. The water in  the machine had broken the chamber, and now spouted out in a jet of  incalculable force; luckily it went in the direction of an old furnace,  which was overthrown, enveloped and carried away by a waterspout.    “Ha!” remarked Planchette serenely, “the piece of skin is as safe and  sound as my eye. There was a flaw in your reservoir somewhere, or a  crevice in the large tube----”    “No, no; I know my reservoir. The devil is in your contrivance, sir; you  can take it away,” and the German pounced upon a smith’s hammer, flung  the skin down on an anvil, and, with all the strength that rage gives,  dealt the talisman the most formidable blow that had ever resounded  through his workshops.    “There is not so much as a mark on it!” said Planchette, stroking the  perverse bit of skin.    The workmen hurried in. The foreman took the skin and buried it in the  glowing coal of a forge, while, in a semi-circle round the fire, they  all awaited the action of a huge pair of bellows. Raphael, Spieghalter,  and Professor Planchette stood in the midst of the grimy expectant  crowd. Raphael, looking round on faces dusted over with iron filings,  white eyes, greasy blackened clothing, and hairy chests, could have  fancied himself transported into the wild nocturnal world of German  ballad poetry. After the skin had been in the fire for ten minutes, the  foreman pulled it out with a pair of pincers.    “Hand it over to me,” said Raphael.    The foreman held it out by way of a joke. The Marquis readily handled  it; it was cool and flexible between his fingers. An exclamation of  alarm went up; the workmen fled in terror. Valentin was left alone with  Planchette in the empty workshop.    “There is certainly something infernal in the thing!” cried Raphael,  in desperation. “Is no human power able to give me one more day of  existence?”    “I made a mistake, sir,” said the mathematician, with a penitent  expression; “we ought to have subjected that peculiar skin to the action  of a rolling machine. Where could my eyes have been when I suggested  compression!”    “It was I that asked for it,” Raphael answered.    The mathematician heaved a sigh of relief, like a culprit acquitted by a  dozen jurors. Still, the strange problem afforded by the skin interested  him; he meditated a moment, and then remarked:    “This unknown material ought to be treated chemically by re-agents. Let  us call on Japhet--perhaps the chemist may have better luck than the  mechanic.”    Valentin urged his horse into a rapid trot, hoping to find the chemist,  the celebrated Japhet, in his laboratory.    “Well, old friend,” Planchette began, seeing Japhet in his armchair,  examining a precipitate; “how goes chemistry?”    “Gone to sleep. Nothing new at all. The Academie, however, has  recognized the existence of salicine, but salicine, asparagine,  vauqueline, and digitaline are not really discoveries----”    “Since you cannot invent substances,” said Raphael, “you are obliged to  fall back on inventing names.”    “Most emphatically true, young man.”    “Here,” said Planchette, addressing the chemist, “try to analyze this  composition; if you can extract any element whatever from it, I christen  it diaboline beforehand, for we have just smashed a hydraulic press in  trying to compress it.”    “Let’s see! let’s have a look at it!” cried the delighted chemist; “it  may, perhaps, be a fresh element.”    “It is simply a piece of the skin of an ass, sir,” said Raphael.    “Sir!” said the illustrious chemist sternly.    “I am not joking,” the Marquis answered, laying the piece of skin before  him.    Baron Japhet applied the nervous fibres of his tongue to the skin; he  had skill in thus detecting salts, acids, alkalis, and gases. After  several experiments, he remarked:    “No taste whatever! Come, we will give it a little fluoric acid to  drink.”    Subjected to the influence of this ready solvent of animal tissue, the  skin underwent no change whatsoever.    “It is not shagreen at all!” the chemist cried. “We will treat this  unknown mystery as a mineral, and try its mettle by dropping it in a  crucible where I have at this moment some red potash.”    Japhet went out, and returned almost immediately.    “Allow me to cut away a bit of this strange substance, sir,” he said to  Raphael; “it is so extraordinary----”    “A bit!” exclaimed Raphael; “not so much as a hair’s-breadth. You may  try, though,” he added, half banteringly, half sadly.    The chemist broke a razor in his desire to cut the skin; he tried to  break it by a powerful electric shock; next he submitted it to the  influence of a galvanic battery; but all the thunderbolts his science  wotted of fell harmless on the dreadful talisman.    It was seven o’clock in the evening. Planchette, Japhet, and Raphael,  unaware of the flight of time, were awaiting the outcome of a final  experiment. The Magic Skin emerged triumphant from a formidable  encounter in which it had been engaged with a considerable quantity of  chloride of nitrogen.    “It is all over with me,” Raphael wailed. “It is the finger of God! I  shall die!----” and he left the two amazed scientific men.    “We must be very careful not to talk about this affair at the Academie;  our colleagues there would laugh at us,” Planchette remarked to the  chemist, after a long pause, in which they looked at each other without  daring to communicate their thoughts. The learned pair looked like  two Christians who had issued from their tombs to find no God in the  heavens. Science had been powerless; acids, so much clear water; red  potash had been discredited; the galvanic battery and electric shock had  been a couple of playthings.    “A hydraulic press broken like a biscuit!” commented Planchette.    “I believe in the devil,” said the Baron Japhet, after a moment’s  silence.    “And I in God,” replied Planchette.    Each spoke in character. The universe for a mechanician is a machine  that requires an operator; for chemistry--that fiendish employment of  decomposing all things--the world is a gas endowed with the power of  movement.    “We cannot deny the fact,” the chemist replied.    “Pshaw! those gentlemen the doctrinaires have invented a nebulous  aphorism for our consolation--Stupid as a fact.”    “Your aphorism,” said the chemist, “seems to me as a fact very stupid.”    They began to laugh, and went off to dine like folk for whom a miracle  is nothing more than a phenomenon.    Valentin reached his own house shivering with rage and consumed with  anger. He had no more faith in anything. Conflicting thoughts shifted  and surged to and fro in his brain, as is the case with every man  brought face to face with an inconceivable fact. He had readily  believed in some hidden flaw in Spieghalter’s apparatus; he had not been  surprised by the incompetence and failure of science and of fire;  but the flexibility of the skin as he handled it, taken with its  stubbornness when all means of destruction that man possesses had  been brought to bear upon it in vain--these things terrified him. The  incontrovertible fact made him dizzy.    “I am mad,” he muttered. “I have had no food since the morning, and yet  I am neither hungry nor thirsty, and there is a fire in my breast that  burns me.”    He put back the skin in the frame where it had been enclosed but lately,  drew a line in red ink about the actual configuration of the talisman,  and seated himself in his armchair.    “Eight o’clock already!” he exclaimed. “To-day has gone like a dream.”    He leaned his elbow on the arm of the chair, propped his head with  his left hand, and so remained, lost in secret dark reflections and  consuming thoughts that men condemned to die bear away with them.    “O Pauline!” he cried. “Poor child! there are gulfs that love can never  traverse, despite the strength of his wings.”    Just then he very distinctly heard a smothered sigh, and knew by one  of the most tender privileges of passionate love that it was Pauline’s  breathing.    “That is my death warrant,” he said to himself. “If she were there, I  should wish to die in her arms.”    A burst of gleeful and hearty laughter made him turn his face towards  the bed; he saw Pauline’s face through the transparent curtains, smiling  like a child for gladness over a successful piece of mischief. Her  pretty hair fell over her shoulders in countless curls; she looked like  a Bengal rose upon a pile of white roses.    “I cajoled Jonathan,” said she. “Doesn’t the bed belong to me, to me who  am your wife? Don’t scold me, darling; I only wanted to surprise you, to  sleep beside you. Forgive me for my freak.”    She sprang out of bed like a kitten, showed herself gleaming in her lawn  raiment, and sat down on Raphael’s knee.    “Love, what gulf were you talking about?” she said, with an anxious  expression apparent upon her face.    “Death.”    “You hurt me,” she answered. “There are some thoughts upon which we,  poor women that we are, cannot dwell; they are death to us. Is it  strength of love in us, or lack of courage? I cannot tell. Death does  not frighten me,” she began again, laughingly. “To die with you, both  together, to-morrow morning, in one last embrace, would be joy. It seems  to me that even then I should have lived more than a hundred years.  What does the number of days matter if we have spent a whole lifetime of  peace and love in one night, in one hour?”    “You are right; Heaven is speaking through that pretty mouth of yours.  Grant that I may kiss you, and let us die,” said Raphael.    “Then let us die,” she said, laughing.    Towards nine o’clock in the morning the daylight streamed through the  chinks of the window shutters. Obscured somewhat by the muslin curtains,  it yet sufficed to show clearly the rich colors of the carpet, the silks  and furniture of the room, where the two lovers were lying asleep. The  gilding sparkled here and there. A ray of sunshine fell and faded upon  the soft down quilt that the freaks of live had thrown to the ground.  The outlines of Pauline’s dress, hanging from a cheval glass, appeared  like a shadowy ghost. Her dainty shoes had been left at a distance from  the bed. A nightingale came to perch upon the sill; its trills repeated  over again, and the sounds of its wings suddenly shaken out for flight,  awoke Raphael.    “For me to die,” he said, following out a thought begun in his dream,  “my organization, the mechanism of flesh and bone, that is quickened  by the will in me, and makes of me an individual MAN, must display some  perceptible disease. Doctors ought to understand the symptoms of any  attack on vitality, and could tell me whether I am sick or sound.”    He gazed at his sleeping wife. She had stretched her head out to him,  expressing in this way even while she slept the anxious tenderness of  love. Pauline seemed to look at him as she lay with her face turned  towards him in an attitude as full of grace as a young child’s, with her  pretty, half-opened mouth held out towards him, as she drew her light,  even breath. Her little pearly teeth seemed to heighten the redness of  the fresh lips with the smile hovering over them. The red glow in her  complexion was brighter, and its whiteness was, so to speak, whiter  still just then than in the most impassioned moments of the waking day.  In her unconstrained grace, as she lay, so full of believing trust,  the adorable attractions of childhood were added to the enchantments of  love.    Even the most unaffected women still obey certain social conventions,  which restrain the free expansion of the soul within them during their  waking hours; but slumber seems to give them back the spontaneity of  life which makes infancy lovely. Pauline blushed for nothing; she was  like one of those beloved and heavenly beings, in whom reason has not  yet put motives into their actions and mystery into their glances.  Her profile stood out in sharp relief against the fine cambric of the  pillows; there was a certain sprightliness about her loose hair in  confusion, mingled with the deep lace ruffles; but she was sleeping in  happiness, her long lashes were tightly pressed against her cheeks, as  if to secure her eyes from too strong a light, or to aid an effort of  her soul to recollect and to hold fast a bliss that had been perfect but  fleeting. Her tiny pink and white ear, framed by a lock of her hair and  outlined by a wrapping of Mechlin lace, would have made an artist, a  painter, an old man, wildly in love, and would perhaps have restored a  madman to his senses.    Is it not an ineffable bliss to behold the woman that you love,  sleeping, smiling in a peaceful dream beneath your protection, loving  you even in dreams, even at the point where the individual seems to  cease to exist, offering to you yet the mute lips that speak to you in  slumber of the latest kiss? Is it not indescribable happiness to see  a trusting woman, half-clad, but wrapped round in her love as by a  cloak--modesty in the midst of dishevelment--to see admiringly her  scattered clothing, the silken stocking hastily put off to please you  last evening, the unclasped girdle that implies a boundless faith in  you. A whole romance lies there in that girdle; the woman that it  used to protect exists no longer; she is yours, she has become _you_;  henceforward any betrayal of her is a blow dealt at yourself.    In this softened mood Raphael’s eyes wandered over the room, now filled  with memories and love, and where the very daylight seemed to take  delightful hues. Then he turned his gaze at last upon the outlines of  the woman’s form, upon youth and purity, and love that even now had no  thought that was not for him alone, above all things, and longed to live  for ever. As his eyes fell upon Pauline, her own opened at once as if a  ray of sunlight had lighted on them.    “Good-morning,” she said, smiling. “How handsome you are, bad man!”    The grace of love and youth, of silence and dawn, shone in their faces,  making a divine picture, with the fleeting spell over it all that  belongs only to the earliest days of passion, just as simplicity and  artlessness are the peculiar possession of childhood. Alas! love’s  springtide joys, like our own youthful laughter, must even take flight,  and live for us no longer save in memory; either for our despair, or  to shed some soothing fragrance over us, according to the bent of our  inmost thoughts.    “What made me wake you?” said Raphael. “It was so great a pleasure to  watch you sleeping that it brought tears to my eyes.”    “And to mine, too,” she answered. “I cried in the night while I watched  you sleeping, but not with happiness. Raphael, dear, pray listen to me.  Your breathing is labored while you sleep, and something rattles in  your chest that frightens me. You have a little dry cough when you are  asleep, exactly like my father’s, who is dying of phthisis. In those  sounds from your lungs I recognized some of the peculiar symptoms of  that complaint. Then you are feverish; I know you are; your hand was  moist and burning----Darling, you are young,” she added with a shudder,  “and you could still get over it if unfortunately----But, no,” she cried  cheerfully, “there is no ‘unfortunately,’ the disease is contagious, so  the doctors say.”    She flung both arms about Raphael, drawing in his breath through one of  those kisses in which the soul reaches its end.    “I do not wish to live to old age,” she said. “Let us both die young,  and go to heaven while flowers fill our hands.”    “We always make such designs as those when we are well and strong,”   Raphael replied, burying his hands in Pauline’s hair. But even then a  horrible fit of coughing came on, one of those deep ominous coughs  that seem to come from the depths of the tomb, a cough that leaves the  sufferer ghastly pale, trembling, and perspiring; with aching sides and  quivering nerves, with a feeling of weariness pervading the very marrow  of the spine, and unspeakable languor in every vein. Raphael slowly laid  himself down, pale, exhausted, and overcome, like a man who has spent  all the strength in him over one final effort. Pauline’s eyes, grown  large with terror, were fixed upon him; she lay quite motionless, pale,  and silent.    “Let us commit no more follies, my angel,” she said, trying not to let  Raphael see the dreadful forebodings that disturbed her. She covered her  face with her hands, for she saw Death before her--the hideous skeleton.  Raphael’s face had grown as pale and livid as any skull unearthed from  a churchyard to assist the studies of some scientific man. Pauline  remembered the exclamation that had escaped from Valentin the previous  evening, and to herself she said:    “Yes, there are gulfs that love can never cross, and therein love must  bury itself.”    On a March morning, some days after this wretched scene, Raphael found  himself seated in an armchair, placed in the window in the full light  of day. Four doctors stood round him, each in turn trying his pulse,  feeling him over, and questioning him with apparent interest. The  invalid sought to guess their thoughts, putting a construction on every  movement they made, and on the slightest contractions of their brows.  His last hope lay in this consultation. This court of appeal was about  to pronounce its decision--life or death.    Valentin had summoned the oracles of modern medicine, so that he might  have the last word of science. Thanks to his wealth and title, there  stood before him three embodied theories; human knowledge fluctuated  round the three points. Three of the doctors brought among them the  complete circle of medical philosophy; they represented the points of  conflict round which the battle raged, between Spiritualism, Analysis,  and goodness knows what in the way of mocking eclecticism.    The fourth doctor was Horace Bianchon, a man of science with a future  before him, the most distinguished man of the new school in medicine, a  discreet and unassuming representative of a studious generation that  is preparing to receive the inheritance of fifty years of experience  treasured up by the Ecole de Paris, a generation that perhaps will erect  the monument for the building of which the centuries behind us have  collected the different materials. As a personal friend of the Marquis  and of Rastignac, he had been in attendance on the former for some  days past, and was helping him to answer the inquiries of the three  professors, occasionally insisting somewhat upon those symptoms which,  in his opinion, pointed to pulmonary disease.    “You have been living at a great pace, leading a dissipated life, no  doubt, and you have devoted yourself largely to intellectual work?”   queried one of the three celebrated authorities, addressing Raphael. He  was a square-headed man, with a large frame and energetic organization,  which seemed to mark him out as superior to his two rivals.    “I made up my mind to kill myself with debauchery, after spending three  years over an extensive work, with which perhaps you may some day occupy  yourselves,” Raphael replied.    The great doctor shook his head, and so displayed his satisfaction. “I  was sure of it,” he seemed to say to himself. He was the illustrious  Brisset, the successor of Cabanis and Bichat, head of the Organic  School, a doctor popular with believers in material and positive  science, who see in man a complete individual, subject solely to the  laws of his own particular organization; and who consider that his  normal condition and abnormal states of disease can both be traced to  obvious causes.    After this reply, Brisset looked, without speaking, at a middle-sized  person, whose darkly flushed countenance and glowing eyes seemed to  belong to some antique satyr; and who, leaning his back against the  corner of the embrasure, was studying Raphael, without saying a word.  Doctor Cameristus, a man of creeds and enthusiasms, the head of the  “Vitalists,” a romantic champion of the esoteric doctrines of Van  Helmont, discerned a lofty informing principle in human life, a  mysterious and inexplicable phenomenon which mocks at the scalpel,  deceives the surgeon, eludes the drugs of the pharmacopoeia, the  formulae of algebra, the demonstrations of anatomy, and derides all  our efforts; a sort of invisible, intangible flame, which, obeying some  divinely appointed law, will often linger on in a body in our opinion  devoted to death, while it takes flight from an organization well fitted  for prolonged existence.    A bitter smile hovered upon the lips of the third doctor, Maugredie, a  man of acknowledged ability, but a Pyrrhonist and a scoffer, with the  scalpel for his one article of faith. He would consider, as a concession  to Brisset, that a man who, as a matter of fact, was perfectly well was  dead, and recognize with Cameristus that a man might be living on after  his apparent demise. He found something sensible in every theory, and  embraced none of them, claiming that the best of all systems of medicine  was to have none at all, and to stick to facts. This Panurge of the  Clinical Schools, the king of observers, the great investigator, a great  sceptic, the man of desperate expedients, was scrutinizing the Magic  Skin.    “I should very much like to be a witness of the coincidence of its  retrenchment with your wish,” he said to the Marquis.    “Where is the use?” cried Brisset.    “Where is the use?” echoed Cameristus.    “Ah, you are both of the same mind,” replied Maugredie.    “The contraction is perfectly simple,” Brisset went on.    “It is supernatural,” remarked Cameristus.    “In short,” Maugredie made answer, with affected solemnity, and handing  the piece of skin to Raphael as he spoke, “the shriveling faculty of the  skin is a fact inexplicable, and yet quite natural, which, ever since  the world began, has been the despair of medicine and of pretty women.”    All Valentin’s observation could discover no trace of a feeling for his  troubles in any of the three doctors. The three received every answer  in silence, scanned him unconcernedly, and interrogated him  unsympathetically. Politeness did not conceal their indifference;  whether deliberation or certainty was the cause, their words at any  rate came so seldom and so languidly, that at times Raphael thought  that their attention was wandering. From time to time Brisset, the  sole speaker, remarked, “Good! just so!” as Bianchon pointed out the  existence of each desperate symptom. Cameristus seemed to be deep in  meditation; Maugredie looked like a comic author, studying two queer  characters with a view to reproducing them faithfully upon the stage.  There was deep, unconcealed distress, and grave compassion in Horace  Bianchon’s face. He had been a doctor for too short a time to be  untouched by suffering and unmoved by a deathbed; he had not learned to  keep back the sympathetic tears that obscure a man’s clear vision  and prevent him from seizing like the general of an army, upon the  auspicious moment for victory, in utter disregard of the groans of dying  men.    After spending about half an hour over taking in some sort the measure  of the patient and the complaint, much as a tailor measures a young man  for a coat when he orders his wedding outfit, the authorities uttered  several commonplaces, and even talked of politics. Then they decided to  go into Raphael’s study to exchange their ideas and frame their verdict.    “May I not be present during the discussion, gentlemen?” Valentin had  asked them, but Brisset and Maugredie protested against this, and, in  spite of their patient’s entreaties, declined altogether to deliberate  in his presence.    Raphael gave way before their custom, thinking that he could slip into  a passage adjoining, whence he could easily overhear the medical  conference in which the three professors were about to engage.    “Permit me, gentlemen,” said Brisset, as they entered, “to give you my  own opinion at once. I neither wish to force it upon you nor to have it  discussed. In the first place, it is unbiased, concise, and based on  an exact similarity that exists between one of my own patients and the  subject that we have been called in to examine; and, moreover, I am  expected at my hospital. The importance of the case that demands my  presence there will excuse me for speaking the first word. The subject  with which we are concerned has been exhausted in an equal degree by  intellectual labors--what did he set about, Horace?” he asked of the  young doctor.    “A ‘Theory of the Will,’”    “The devil! but that’s a big subject. He is exhausted, I say, by too  much brain-work, by irregular courses, and by the repeated use of too  powerful stimulants. Violent exertion of body and mind has demoralized  the whole system. It is easy, gentlemen, to recognize in the symptoms  of the face and body generally intense irritation of the stomach, an  affection of the great sympathetic nerve, acute sensibility of the  epigastric region, and contraction of the right and left hypochondriac.  You have noticed, too, the large size and prominence of the liver. M.  Bianchon has, besides, constantly watched the patient, and he tells us  that digestion is troublesome and difficult. Strictly speaking, there is  no stomach left, and so the man has disappeared. The brain is atrophied  because the man digests no longer. The progressive deterioration wrought  in the epigastric region, the seat of vitality, has vitiated the whole  system. Thence, by continuous fevered vibrations, the disorder has  reached the brain by means of the nervous plexus, hence the excessive  irritation in that organ. There is monomania. The patient is burdened  with a fixed idea. That piece of skin really contracts, to his way of  thinking; very likely it always has been as we have seen it; but whether  it contracts or no, that thing is for him just like the fly that some  Grand Vizier or other had on his nose. If you put leeches at once on the  epigastrium, and reduce the irritation in that part, which is the very  seat of man’s life, and if you diet the patient, the monomania will  leave him. I will say no more to Dr. Bianchon; he should be able to  grasp the whole treatment as well as the details. There may be, perhaps,  some complication of the disease--the bronchial tubes, possibly, may be  also inflamed; but I believe that treatment for the intestinal organs is  very much more important and necessary, and more urgently required than  for the lungs. Persistent study of abstract matters, and certain violent  passions, have induced serious disorders in that vital mechanism.  However, we are in time to set these conditions right. Nothing is too  seriously affected. You will easily get your friend round again,” he  remarked to Bianchon.    “Our learned colleague is taking the effect for the cause,” Cameristus  replied. “Yes, the changes that he has observed so keenly certainly  exist in the patient; but it is not the stomach that, by degrees, has  set up nervous action in the system, and so affected the brain, like a  hole in a window pane spreading cracks round about it. It took a blow  of some kind to make a hole in the window; who gave the blow? Do we  know that? Have we investigated the patient’s case sufficiently? Are we  acquainted with all the events of his life?    “The vital principle, gentlemen,” he continued, “the Archeus of Van  Helmont, is affected in his case--the very essence and centre of life is  attacked. The divine spark, the transitory intelligence which holds the  organism together, which is the source of the will, the inspiration of  life, has ceased to regulate the daily phenomena of the mechanism and  the functions of every organ; thence arise all the complications which  my learned colleague has so thoroughly appreciated. The epigastric  region does not affect the brain but the brain affects the epigastric  region. No,” he went on, vigorously slapping his chest, “no, I am not  a stomach in the form of a man. No, everything does not lie there. I do  not feel that I have the courage to say that if the epigastric region is  in good order, everything else is in a like condition----    “We cannot trace,” he went on more mildly, “to one physical cause the  serious disturbances that supervene in this or that subject which has  been dangerously attacked, nor submit them to a uniform treatment.  No one man is like another. We have each peculiar organs, differently  affected, diversely nourished, adapted to perform different functions,  and to induce a condition necessary to the accomplishment of an order  of things which is unknown to us. The sublime will has so wrought that  a little portion of the great All is set within us to sustain the  phenomena of living; in every man it formulates itself distinctly,  making each, to all appearance, a separate individual, yet in one point  co-existent with the infinite cause. So we ought to make a separate  study of each subject, discover all about it, find out in what its life  consists, and wherein its power lies. From the softness of a wet sponge  to the hardness of pumice-stone there are infinite fine degrees of  difference. Man is just like that. Between the sponge-like organizations  of the lymphatic and the vigorous iron muscles of such men as are  destined for a long life, what a margin for errors for the single  inflexible system of a lowering treatment to commit; a system that  reduces the capacities of the human frame, which you always conclude  have been over-excited. Let us look for the origin of the disease in the  mental and not in the physical viscera. A doctor is an inspired being,  endowed by God with a special gift--the power to read the secrets of  vitality; just as the prophet has received the eyes that foresee the  future, the poet his faculty of evoking nature, and the musician the  power of arranging sounds in an harmonious order that is possibly a copy  of an ideal harmony on high.”    “There is his everlasting system of medicine, arbitrary, monarchical,  and pious,” muttered Brisset.    “Gentlemen,” Maugredie broke in hastily, to distract attention from  Brisset’s comment, “don’t let us lose sight of the patient.”    “What is the good of science?” Raphael moaned. “Here is my recovery  halting between a string of beads and a rosary of leeches, between  Dupuytren’s bistoury and Prince Hohenlohe’s prayer. There is Maugredie  suspending his judgment on the line that divides facts from words, mind  from matter. Man’s ‘it is,’ and ‘it is not,’ is always on my track;  it is the _Carymary Carymara_ of Rabelais for evermore: my disorder is  spiritual, _Carymary_, or material, _Carymara_. Shall I live? They have  no idea. Planchette was more straightforward with me, at any rate, when  he said, ‘I do not know.’”    Just then Valentin heard Maugredie’s voice.    “The patient suffers from monomania; very good, I am quite of that  opinion,” he said, “but he has two hundred thousand a year; monomaniacs  of that kind are very uncommon. As for knowing whether his epigastric  region has affected his brain, or his brain his epigastric region, we  shall find that out, perhaps, whenever he dies. But to resume. There  is no disputing the fact that he is ill; some sort of treatment he must  have. Let us leave theories alone, and put leeches on him, to counteract  the nervous and intestinal irritation, as to the existence of which we  all agree; and let us send him to drink the waters, in that way we shall  act on both systems at once. If there really is tubercular disease, we  can hardly expect to save his life; so that----”    Raphael abruptly left the passage, and went back to his armchair. The  four doctors very soon came out of the study; Horace was the spokesman.    “These gentlemen,” he told him, “have unanimously agreed that leeches  must be applied to the stomach at once, and that both physical and  moral treatment are imperatively needed. In the first place, a carefully  prescribed rule of diet, so as to soothe the internal irritation”--here  Brisset signified his approval; “and in the second, a hygienic regimen,  to set your general condition right. We all, therefore, recommend you  to go to take the waters in Aix in Savoy; or, if you like it better, at  Mont Dore in Auvergne; the air and the situation are both pleasanter in  Savoy than in the Cantal, but you will consult your own taste.”    Here it was Cameristus who nodded assent.    “These gentlemen,” Bianchon continued, “having recognized a slight  affection of the respiratory organs, are agreed as to the utility of  the previous course of treatment that I have prescribed. They think  that there will be no difficulty about restoring you to health, and that  everything depends upon a wise and alternate employment of these various  means. And----”    “And that is the cause of the milk in the cocoanut,” said Raphael,  with a smile, as he led Horace into his study to pay the fees for this  useless consultation.    “Their conclusions are logical,” the young doctor replied. “Cameristus  feels, Brisset examines, Maugredie doubts. Has not man a soul, a body,  and an intelligence? One of these three elemental constituents always  influences us more or less strongly; there will always be the personal  element in human science. Believe me, Raphael, we effect no cures; we  only assist them. Another system--the use of mild remedies while Nature  exerts her powers--lies between the extremes of theory of Brisset and  Cameristus, but one ought to have known the patient for some ten years  or so to obtain a good result on these lines. Negation lies at the  back of all medicine, as in every other science. So endeavor to live  wholesomely; try a trip to Savoy; the best course is, and always will  be, to trust to Nature.”    It was a month later, on a fine summer-like evening, that several  people, who were taking the waters at Aix, returned from the promenade  and met together in the salons of the Club. Raphael remained alone by a  window for a long time. His back was turned upon the gathering, and he  himself was deep in those involuntary musings in which thoughts arise in  succession and fade away, shaping themselves indistinctly, passing over  us like thin, almost colorless clouds. Melancholy is sweet to us then,  and delight is shadowy, for the soul is half asleep. Valentin gave  himself up to this life of sensations; he was steeping himself in the  warm, soft twilight, enjoying the pure air with the scent of the  hills in it, happy in that he felt no pain, and had tranquilized his  threatening Magic Skin at last. It grew cooler as the red glow of the  sunset faded on the mountain peaks; he shut the window and left his  place.    “Will you be so kind as not to close the windows, sir?” said an old  lady; “we are being stifled----”    The peculiarly sharp and jarring tones in which the phrase was uttered  grated on Raphael’s ears; it fell on them like an indiscreet remark let  slip by some man in whose friendship we would fain believe, a word which  reveals unsuspected depths of selfishness and destroys some pleasing  sentimental illusion of ours. The Marquis glanced, with the cool  inscrutable expression of a diplomatist, at the old lady, called a  servant, and, when he came, curtly bade him:    “Open that window.”    Great surprise was clearly expressed on all faces at the words. The  whole roomful began to whisper to each other, and turned their eyes upon  the invalid, as though he had",46.24,12.6,15.1,9.18,17.0,6.79,3181,14.75,17.1,14th and 15th grade

Your gracious lady,     Whose beauty is a lamp that pales the stars     And robs Diana’s quiver of her beams     Has welcomed me with such sweet courtesies     That if it be her pleasure, and your own,     I will come often to your simple house.     And when your business bids you walk abroad     I will sit here and charm her loneliness     Lest she might sorrow for you overmuch.     What say you, good Simone?       SIMONE.  My noble Lord,     You bring me such high honour that my tongue     Like a slave’s tongue is tied, and cannot say     The word it would.  Yet not to give you thanks     Were to be too unmannerly.  So, I thank you,     From my heart’s core.       It is such things as these     That knit a state together, when a Prince     So nobly born and of such fair address,     Forgetting unjust Fortune’s differences,     Comes to an honest burgher’s honest home     As a most honest friend.       And yet, my Lord,     I fear I am too bold.  Some other night     We trust that you will come here as a friend;     To-night you come to buy my merchandise.     Is it not so?  Silks, velvets, what you will,     I doubt not but I have some dainty wares     Will woo your fancy.  True, the hour is late,     But we poor merchants toil both night and day     To make our scanty gains.  The tolls are high,     And every city levies its own toll,     And prentices are unskilful, and wives even     Lack sense and cunning, though Bianca here     Has brought me a rich customer to-night.     Is it not so, Bianca?  But I waste time.     Where is my pack?  Where is my pack, I say?     Open it, my good wife.  Unloose the cords.     Kneel down upon the floor.  You are better so.     Nay not that one, the other.  Despatch, despatch!     Buyers will grow impatient oftentimes.     We dare not keep them waiting.  Ay! ’tis that,     Give it to me; with care.  It is most costly.     Touch it with care.  And now, my noble Lord—     Nay, pardon, I have here a Lucca damask,     The very web of silver and the roses     So cunningly wrought that they lack perfume merely     To cheat the wanton sense.  Touch it, my Lord.     Is it not soft as water, strong as steel?     And then the roses!  Are they not finely woven?     I think the hillsides that best love the rose,     At Bellosguardo or at Fiesole,     Throw no such blossoms on the lap of spring,     Or if they do their blossoms droop and die.     Such is the fate of all the dainty things     That dance in wind and water.  Nature herself     Makes war on her own loveliness and slays     Her children like Medea.  Nay but, my Lord,     Look closer still.  Why in this damask here     It is summer always, and no winter’s tooth     Will ever blight these blossoms.  For every ell     I paid a piece of gold.  Red gold, and good,     The fruit of careful thrift.       GUIDO.  Honest Simone,     Enough, I pray you.  I am well content;     To-morrow I will send my servant to you,     Who will pay twice your price.       SIMONE.  My generous Prince!     I kiss your hands.  And now I do remember     Another treasure hidden in my house     Which you must see.  It is a robe of state:     Woven by a Venetian: the stuff, cut-velvet:     The pattern, pomegranates: each separate seed     Wrought of a pearl: the collar all of pearls,     As thick as moths in summer streets at night,     And whiter than the moons that madmen see     Through prison bars at morning.  A male ruby     Burns like a lighted coal within the clasp     The Holy Father has not such a stone,     Nor could the Indies show a brother to it.     The brooch itself is of most curious art,     Cellini never made a fairer thing     To please the great Lorenzo.  You must wear it.     There is none worthier in our city here,     And it will suit you well.  Upon one side     A slim and horned satyr leaps in gold     To catch some nymph of silver.  Upon the other     Stands Silence with a crystal in her hand,     No bigger than the smallest ear of corn,     That wavers at the passing of a bird,     And yet so cunningly wrought that one would say,     It breathed, or held its breath.       Worthy Bianca,     Would not this noble and most costly robe     Suit young Lord Guido well?       Nay, but entreat him;     He will refuse you nothing, though the price     Be as a prince’s ransom.  And your profit     Shall not be less than mine.       BIANCA.  Am I your prentice?     Why should I chaffer for your velvet robe?       GUIDO.  Nay, fair Bianca, I will buy the robe,     And all things that the honest merchant has     I will buy also.  Princes must be ransomed,     And fortunate are all high lords who fall     Into the white hands of so fair a foe.       SIMONE.  I stand rebuked.  But you will buy my wares?     Will you not buy them?  Fifty thousand crowns     Would scarce repay me.  But you, my Lord, shall have them     For forty thousand.  Is that price too high?     Name your own price.  I have a curious fancy     To see you in this wonder of the loom     Amidst the noble ladies of the court,     A flower among flowers.       They say, my lord,     These highborn dames do so affect your Grace     That where you go they throng like flies around you,     Each seeking for your favour.       I have heard also     Of husbands that wear horns, and wear them bravely,     A fashion most fantastical.       GUIDO.  Simone,     Your reckless tongue needs curbing; and besides,     You do forget this gracious lady here     Whose delicate ears are surely not attuned     To such coarse music.       SIMONE.  True: I had forgotten,     Nor will offend again.  Yet, my sweet Lord,     You’ll buy the robe of state.  Will you not buy it?     But forty thousand crowns—’tis but a trifle,     To one who is Giovanni Bardi’s heir.       GUIDO.  Settle this thing to-morrow with my steward,     Antonio Costa.  He will come to you.     And you shall have a hundred thousand crowns     If that will serve your purpose.       SIMONE.  A hundred thousand!     Said you a hundred thousand?  Oh! be sure     That will for all time and in everything     Make me your debtor.  Ay! from this time forth     My house, with everything my house contains     Is yours, and only yours.       A hundred thousand!     My brain is dazed.  I shall be richer far     Than all the other merchants.  I will buy     Vineyards and lands and gardens.  Every loom     From Milan down to Sicily shall be mine,     And mine the pearls that the Arabian seas     Store in their silent caverns.       Generous Prince,     This night shall prove the herald of my love,     Which is so great that whatsoe’er you ask     It will not be denied you.       GUIDO.  What if I asked     For white Bianca here?       SIMONE.  You jest, my Lord;     She is not worthy of so great a Prince.     She is but made to keep the house and spin.     Is it not so, good wife?  It is so.  Look!     Your distaff waits for you.  Sit down and spin.     Women should not be idle in their homes,     For idle fingers make a thoughtless heart.     Sit down, I say.       BIANCA.  What shall I spin?       SIMONE.  Oh! spin     Some robe which, dyed in purple, sorrow might wear     For her own comforting: or some long-fringed cloth     In which a new-born and unwelcome babe     Might wail unheeded; or a dainty sheet     Which, delicately perfumed with sweet herbs,     Might serve to wrap a dead man.  Spin what you will;     I care not, I.       BIANCA.  The brittle thread is broken,     The dull wheel wearies of its ceaseless round,     The duller distaff sickens of its load;     I will not spin to-night.       SIMONE.  It matters not.     To-morrow you shall spin, and every day     Shall find you at your distaff.  So Lucretia     Was found by Tarquin.  So, perchance, Lucretia     Waited for Tarquin.  Who knows?  I have heard     Strange things about men’s wives.  And now, my lord,     What news abroad?  I heard to-day at Pisa     That certain of the English merchants there     Would sell their woollens at a lower rate     Than the just laws allow, and have entreated     The Signory to hear them.       Is this well?     Should merchant be to merchant as a wolf?     And should the stranger living in our land     Seek by enforced privilege or craft     To rob us of our profits?       GUIDO.  What should I do     With merchants or their profits?  Shall I go     And wrangle with the Signory on your count?     And wear the gown in which you buy from fools,     Or sell to sillier bidders?  Honest Simone,     Wool-selling or wool-gathering is for you.     My wits have other quarries.       BIANCA.  Noble Lord,     I pray you pardon my good husband here,     His soul stands ever in the market-place,     And his heart beats but at the price of wool.     Yet he is honest in his common way.                                  [_To_ SIMONE]       And you, have you no shame?  A gracious Prince     Comes to our house, and you must weary him     With most misplaced assurance.  Ask his pardon.       SIMONE.  I ask it humbly.  We will talk to-night     Of other things.  I hear the Holy Father     Has sent a letter to the King of France     Bidding him cross that shield of snow, the Alps,     And make a peace in Italy, which will be     Worse than a war of brothers, and more bloody     Than civil rapine or intestine feuds.       GUIDO.  Oh! we are weary of that King of France,     Who never comes, but ever talks of coming.     What are these things to me?  There are other things     Closer, and of more import, good Simone.       BIANCA [_To Simone_].  I think you tire our most gracious guest.     What is the King of France to us?  As much     As are your English merchants with their wool.                                    * * * * *       SIMONE.  Is it so then?  Is all this mighty world     Narrowed into the confines of this room     With but three souls for poor inhabitants?     Ay! there are times when the great universe,     Like cloth in some unskilful dyer’s vat,     Shrivels into a handbreadth, and perchance     That time is now!  Well! let that time be now.     Let this mean room be as that mighty stage     Whereon kings die, and our ignoble lives     Become the stakes God plays for.       I do not know     Why I speak thus.  My ride has wearied me.     And my horse stumbled thrice, which is an omen     That bodes not good to any.       Alas! my lord,     How poor a bargain is this life of man,     And in how mean a market are we sold!     When we are born our mothers weep, but when     We die there is none weeps for us.  No, not one.                           [_Passes to back of stage_.]       BIANCA.  How like a common chapman does he speak!     I hate him, soul and body.  Cowardice     Has set her pale seal on his brow.  His hands     Whiter than poplar leaves in windy springs,     Shake with some palsy; and his stammering mouth     Blurts out a foolish froth of empty words     Like water from a conduit.       GUIDO.  Sweet Bianca,     He is not worthy of your thought or mine.     The man is but a very honest knave     Full of fine phrases for life’s merchandise,     Selling most dear what he must hold most cheap,     A windy brawler in a world of words.     I never met so eloquent a fool.       BIANCA.  Oh, would that Death might take him where he stands!       SIMONE [_turning round_].  Who spake of Death?  Let no one speak of     Death.     What should Death do in such a merry house,     With but a wife, a husband, and a friend     To give it greeting?  Let Death go to houses     Where there are vile, adulterous things, chaste wives     Who growing weary of their noble lords     Draw back the curtains of their marriage beds,     And in polluted and dishonoured sheets     Feed some unlawful lust.  Ay! ’tis so     Strange, and yet so.  _You_ do not know the world.     _You_ are too single and too honourable.     I know it well.  And would it were not so,     But wisdom comes with winters.  My hair grows grey,     And youth has left my body.  Enough of that.     To-night is ripe for pleasure, and indeed,     I would be merry as beseems a host     Who finds a gracious and unlooked-for guest     Waiting to greet him.  [_Takes up a lute_.]     But what is this, my lord?     Why, you have brought a lute to play to us.     Oh! play, sweet Prince.  And, if I am too bold,     Pardon, but play.       GUIDO.  I will not play to-night.     Some other night, Simone.       [_To_ BIANCA]  You and I     Together, with no listeners but the stars,     Or the more jealous moon.       SIMONE.  Nay, but my lord!     Nay, but I do beseech you.  For I have heard     That by the simple fingering of a string,     Or delicate breath breathed along hollowed reeds,     Or blown into cold mouths of cunning bronze,     Those who are curious in this art can draw     Poor souls from prison-houses.  I have heard also     How such strange magic lurks within these shells     That at their bidding casements open wide     And Innocence puts vine-leaves in her hair,     And wantons like a mænad.  Let that pass.     Your lute I know is chaste.  And therefore play:     Ravish my ears with some sweet melody;     My soul is in a prison-house, and needs     Music to cure its madness.  Good Bianca,     Entreat our guest to play.       BIANCA.  Be not afraid,     Our well-loved guest will choose his place and moment:     That moment is not now.  You weary him     With your uncouth insistence.       GUIDO.  Honest Simone,     Some other night.  To-night I am content     With the low music of Bianca’s voice,     Who, when she speaks, charms the too amorous air,     And makes the reeling earth stand still, or fix     His cycle round her beauty.       SIMONE.  You flatter her.     She has her virtues as most women have,     But beauty in a gem she may not wear.     It is better so, perchance.       Well, my dear lord,     If you will not draw melodies from your lute     To charm my moody and o’er-troubled soul     You’ll drink with me at least?                                       [_Motioning_ GUIDO _to his own place_.]       Your place is laid.     Fetch me a stool, Bianca.  Close the shutters.     Set the great bar across.  I would not have     The curious world with its small prying eyes     To peer upon our pleasure.       Now, my lord,     Give us a toast from a full brimming cup.                                                              [_Starts back_.]       What is this stain upon the cloth?  It looks     As purple as a wound upon Christ’s side.     Wine merely is it?  I have heard it said     When wine is spilt blood is spilt also,     But that’s a foolish tale.       My lord, I trust     My grape is to your liking?  The wine of Naples     Is fiery like its mountains.  Our Tuscan vineyards     Yield a more wholesome juice.       GUIDO.  I like it well,     Honest Simone; and, with your good leave,     Will toast the fair Bianca when her lips     Have like red rose-leaves floated on this cup     And left its vintage sweeter.  Taste, Bianca.                                                            [BIANCA _drinks_.]       Oh, all the honey of Hyblean bees,     Matched with this draught were bitter!     Good Simone,     You do not share the feast.       SIMONE.  It is strange, my lord,     I cannot eat or drink with you, to-night.     Some humour, or some fever in my blood,     At other seasons temperate, or some thought     That like an adder creeps from point to point,     That like a madman crawls from cell to cell,     Poisons my palate and makes appetite     A loathing, not a longing.                                                               [_Goes aside_.]       GUIDO.  Sweet Bianca,     This common chapman wearies me with words.     I must go hence.  To-morrow I will come.     Tell me the hour.       BIANCA.  Come with the youngest dawn!     Until I see you all my life is vain.       GUIDO.  Ah! loose the falling midnight of your hair,     And in those stars, your eyes, let me behold     Mine image, as in mirrors.  Dear Bianca,     Though it be but a shadow, keep me there,     Nor gaze at anything that does not show     Some symbol of my semblance.  I am jealous     Of what your vision feasts on.       BIANCA.  Oh! be sure     Your image will be with me always.  Dear     Love can translate the very meanest thing     Into a sign of sweet remembrances.     But come before the lark with its shrill song     Has waked a world of dreamers.  I will stand     Upon the balcony.       GUIDO.  And by a ladder     Wrought out of scarlet silk and sewn with pearls     Will come to meet me.  White foot after foot,     Like snow upon a rose-tree.       BIANCA.  As you will.     You know that I am yours for love or Death.       GUIDO.  Simone, I must go to mine own house.       SIMONE.  So soon?  Why should you?  The great Duomo’s bell     Has not yet tolled its midnight, and the watchmen     Who with their hollow horns mock the pale moon,     Lie drowsy in their towers.  Stay awhile.     I fear we may not see you here again,     And that fear saddens my too simple heart.       GUIDO.  Be not afraid, Simone.  I will stand     Most constant in my friendship, But to-night     I go to mine own home, and that at once.     To-morrow, sweet Bianca.       SIMONE.  Well, well, so be it.     I would have wished for fuller converse with you,     My new friend, my honourable guest,     But that it seems may not be.       And besides     I do not doubt your father waits for you,     Wearying for voice or footstep.  You, I think,     Are his one child?  He has no other child.     You are the gracious pillar of his house,     The flower of a garden full of weeds.     Your father’s nephews do not love him well     So run folks’ tongues in Florence.  I meant but that.     Men say they envy your inheritance     And look upon your vineyards with fierce eyes     As Ahab looked on Naboth’s goodly field.     But that is but the chatter of a town     Where women talk too much.       Good-night, my lord.     Fetch a pine torch, Bianca.  The old staircase     Is full of pitfalls, and the churlish moon     Grows, like a miser, niggard of her beams,     And hides her face behind a muslin mask     As harlots do when they go forth to snare     Some wretched soul in sin.  Now, I will get     Your cloak and sword.  Nay, pardon, my good Lord,     It is but meet that I should wait on you     Who have so honoured my poor burgher’s house,     Drunk of my wine, and broken bread, and made     Yourself a sweet familiar.  Oftentimes     My wife and I will talk of this fair night     And its great issues.       Why, what a sword is this.     Ferrara’s temper, pliant as a snake,     And deadlier, I doubt not.  With such steel,     One need fear nothing in the moil of life.     I never touched so delicate a blade.     I have a sword too, somewhat rusted now.     We men of peace are taught humility,     And to bear many burdens on our backs,     And not to murmur at an unjust world,     And to endure unjust indignities.     We are taught that, and like the patient Jew     Find profit in our pain.       Yet I remember     How once upon the road to Padua     A robber sought to take my pack-horse from me,     I slit his throat and left him.  I can bear     Dishonour, public insult, many shames,     Shrill scorn, and open contumely, but he     Who filches from me something that is mine,     Ay! though it be the meanest trencher-plate     From which I feed mine appetite—oh! he     Perils his soul and body in the theft     And dies for his small sin.  From what strange clay     We men are moulded!       GUIDO.  Why do you speak like this?       SIMONE.  I wonder, my Lord Guido, if my sword     Is better tempered than this steel of yours?     Shall we make trial?  Or is my state too low     For you to cross your rapier against mine,     In jest, or earnest?       GUIDO.  Naught would please me better     Than to stand fronting you with naked blade     In jest, or earnest.  Give me mine own sword.     Fetch yours.  To-night will settle the great issue     Whether the Prince’s or the merchant’s steel     Is better tempered.  Was not that your word?     Fetch your own sword.  Why do you tarry, sir?       SIMONE.  My lord, of all the gracious courtesies     That you have showered on my barren house     This is the highest.       Bianca, fetch my sword.     Thrust back that stool and table.  We must have     An open circle for our match at arms,     And good Bianca here shall hold the torch     Lest what is but a jest grow serious.       BIANCA [_To Guido_].  Oh! kill him, kill him!       SIMONE.  Hold the torch, Bianca.                                                      [_They begin to fight_.]       SIMONE.  Have at you!  Ah!  Ha! would you?                                                   [_He is wounded by_ GUIDO.]       A scratch, no more.  The torch was in mine eyes.     Do not look sad, Bianca.  It is nothing.     Your husband bleeds, ’tis nothing.  Take a cloth,     Bind it about mine arm.  Nay, not so tight.     More softly, my good wife.  And be not sad,     I pray you be not sad.  No; take it off.     What matter if I bleed?                                                        [_Tears bandage off_.]       Again! again!                             [SIMONE _disarms_ GUIDO]       My gentle Lord, you see that I was right     My sword is better tempered, finer steel,     But let us match our daggers.       BIANCA [_to_ GUIDO]     Kill him! kill him!       SIMONE.  Put out the torch, Bianca.                                                    [BIANCA _puts out torch_.]       Now, my good Lord,     Now to the death of one, or both of us,     Or all three it may be.  [_They fight_.]       There and there.     Ah, devil! do I hold thee in my grip?           [SIMONE _overpowers Guido and throws him down over table_.]       GUIDO.  Fool! take your strangling fingers from my throat.     I am my father’s only son; the State     Has but one heir, and that false enemy France     Waits for the ending of my father’s line     To fall upon our city.       SIMONE.  Hush! your father     When he is childless will be happier.     As for the State, I think our state of Florence     Needs no adulterous pilot at its helm.     Your life would soil its lilies.       GUIDO.  Take off your hands     Take off your damned hands.  Loose me, I say!       SIMONE.

8,Annals of the Parishr,"Miss Spangle, the lady he had brought, he happened to see Mungo  Argyle with his dogs and his gun, and my lord being as particular about  his game as the other was about boxes of tea and kegs of brandy, he  jumped out of the carriage, and ran to take the gun.  Words passed, and  the exciseman shot my lord.  Never shall I forget that day; such riding,  such running, the whole country side afoot; but the same night my lord  breathed his last; and the mad and wild reprobate that did the deed was  taken up and sent off to Edinburgh.  This was a woeful riddance of that  oppressor, for my lord was a good landlord and a kind-hearted man; and  albeit, though a little thoughtless, was aye ready to make his power,  when the way was pointed out, minister to good works.  The whole parish  mourned for him, and there was not a sorer heart in all its bounds than  my own.  Never was such a sight seen as his burial: the whole country  side was there, and all as solemn as if they had been assembled in the  valley of Jehoshaphat in the latter day.  The hedges where the funeral  was to pass were clad with weans, like bunches of hips and haws, and the  kirkyard was as if all its own dead were risen.  Never, do I think, was  such a multitude gathered together.  Some thought there could not be less  than three thousand grown men, besides women and children.    Scarcely was this great public calamity past, for it could be reckoned no  less, when one Saturday afternoon, as Miss Sabrina, the schoolmistress,  was dining with Lady Macadam, her ladyship was stricken with the  paralytics, and her face so thrown in the course of a few minutes, that  Miss Sabrina came flying to the manse for the help and advice of Mrs.  Balwhidder.  A doctor was gotten with all speed by express; but her  ladyship was smitten beyond the reach of medicine.  She lived, however,  some time after; but oh! she was such an object, that it was a grief to  see her.  She could only mutter when she tried to speak, and was as  helpless as a baby.  Though she never liked me, nor could I say there was  many things in her demeanour that pleased me; yet she was a free-handed  woman to the needful, and when she died she was more missed than it was  thought she could have been.    Shortly after her funeral, which was managed by a gentleman sent from her  friends in Edinburgh, that I wrote to about her condition, the Major, her  son, with his lady, Kate Malcolm, and two pretty bairns, came and stayed  in her house for a time, and they were a great happiness to us all, both  in the way of drinking tea, and sometimes taking a bit of dinner, their  only mother now, the worthy and pious Mrs. Malcolm, being regularly of  the company.    Before the end of the year, I should mention, that the fortune of Mrs.  Malcolm’s family got another shove upwards, by the promotion of her  second son, Robert Malcolm, who, being grown an expert and careful  mariner, was made captain of a grand ship, whereof Provost Maitland of  Glasgow, that was kind to his mother in her distresses, was the owner.  But that douce lad Willie, her youngest son, who was at the university of  Glasgow under the Lord Eaglesham’s patronage, was like to have suffered a  blight.  However, Major Macadam, when I spoke to him anent the young  man’s loss of his patron, said, with a pleasant generosity, he should not  be stickit; and, accordingly, he made up, as far as money could, for the  loss of his lordship; but there was none that made up for the great power  and influence, which, I have no doubt, the Earl would have exerted in his  behalf, when he was ripened for the church.  So that, although in time  William came out a sound and heart-searching preacher, he was long  obliged, like many another unfriended saint, to cultivate sand, and wash  Ethiopians in the shape of an east country gentleman’s camstrairy weans;  than which, as he wrote me himself, there cannot be on earth a greater  trial of temper.  However, in the end he was rewarded, and is not only  now a placed minister, but a doctor of divinity.    The death of Lady Macadam was followed by another parochial misfortune;  for, considering the time when it happened, we could count it as nothing  less.  Auld Thomas Howkings, the betheral, fell sick, and died in the  course of a week’s illness, about the end of November; and the measles  coming at that time upon the parish, there was such a smashery of the  poor weans as had not been known for an age; insomuch that James Banes,  the lad who was Thomas Howkings’ helper, rose in open rebellion against  the session during his superior’s illness; and we were constrained to  augment his pay, and to promise him the place if Thomas did not recover,  which it was then thought he could not do.  On the day this happened,  there were three dead children in the clachan, and a panic and  consternation spread about the burial of them when James Bane’s  insurrection was known, which made both me and the session glad to hush  up the affair, that the heart of the public might have no more than the  sufferings of individuals to hurt it.—Thus ended a year, on many  accounts, heavy to be remembered.          CHAPTER XXIII  YEAR 1782      ALTHOUGH I have not been particular in noticing it, from time to time,  there had been an occasional going off, at fairs and on market-days, of  the lads of the parish as soldiers, and when Captain Malcolm got the  command of his ship, no less than four young men sailed with him from the  clachan; so that we were deeper and deeper interested in the proceedings  of the doleful war that was raging in the plantations.  By one post we  heard of no less than three brave fellows belonging to us being slain in  one battle, for which there was a loud and general lamentation.    Shortly after this, I got a letter from Charles Malcolm, a very pretty  letter it indeed was: he had heard of my Lord Eaglesham’s murder, and  grieved for the loss, both because his lordship was a good man, and  because he had been such a friend to him and his family.  “But,” said  Charles, “the best way I can show my gratitude for his patronage, is to  prove myself a good officer to my king and country.”  Which I thought a  brave sentiment, and was pleased thereat; for somehow Charles, from the  time he brought me the limes to make a bowl of punch, in his pocket from  Jamaica, had built a nest of affection in my heart.  But, oh! the wicked  wastry of life in war.  In less than a month after, the news came of a  victory over the French fleet, and by the same post I got a letter from  Mr. Howard, that was the midshipman who came to see us with Charles,  telling me that poor Charles had been mortally wounded in the action, and  had afterwards died of his wounds.  “He was a hero in the engagement,”  said Mr. Howard, “and he died as a good and a brave man should.”—These  tidings gave me one of the sorest hearts I ever suffered, and it was long  before I could gather fortitude to disclose the tidings to poor Charles’s  mother.  But the callants of the school had heard of the victory, and  were going shouting about, and had set the steeple bell a-ringing, by  which Mrs. Malcolm heard the news; and knowing that Charles’s ship was  with the fleet, she came over to the manse in great anxiety to hear the  particulars, somebody telling her that there had been a foreign letter to  me by the postman.    When I saw her I could not speak, but looked at her in pity, and, the  tear fleeing up into my eyes, she guessed what had happened.  After  giving a deep and sore sigh, she enquired, “How did he behave?  I hope  well, for he was aye a gallant laddie!”—and then she wept very bitterly.  However, growing calmer, I read to her the letter; and, when I had done,  she begged me to give it to her to keep, saying, “It’s all that I have  now left of my pretty boy; but it’s mair precious to me than the wealth  of the Indies;” and she begged me to return thanks to the Lord for all  the comforts and manifold mercies with which her lot had been blessed,  since the hour she put her trust in him alone; and that was when she was  left a penniless widow, with her five fatherless bairns.    It was just an edification of the spirit to see the Christian resignation  of this worthy woman.  Mrs. Balwhidder was confounded, and said, there  was more sorrow in seeing the deep grief of her fortitude than tongue  could tell.                             [Picture: The Old Herd]    Having taken a glass of wine with her, I walked out to conduct her to her  own house; but in the way we met with a severe trial.  All the weans were  out parading with napkins and kail-blades on sticks, rejoicing and  triumphing in the glad tidings of victory.  But when they saw me and Mrs.  Malcolm coming slowly along, they guessed what had happened, and threw  away their banners of joy; and standing all up in a row, with silence and  sadness, along the kirkyard wall as we passed, showed an instinct of  compassion that penetrated to my very soul.  The poor mother burst into  fresh affliction, and some of the bairns into an audible weeping; and,  taking one another by the hand, they followed us to her door, like  mourners at a funeral.  Never was such a sight seen in any town before.  The neighbours came to look at it as we walked along, and the men turned  aside to hide their faces; while the mothers pressed their babies  fondlier to their bosoms, and watered their innocent faces with their  tears.    I prepared a suitable sermon, taking as the words of my text, “Howl, ye  ships of Tarshish, for your strength is laid waste.”  But when I saw  around me so many of my people clad in complimentary mourning for the  gallant Charles Malcolm, and that even poor daft Jenny Gaffaw, and her  daughter, had on an old black riband; and when I thought of him, the  spirited laddie, coming home from Jamaica with his parrot on his  shoulder, and his limes for me, my heart filled full, and I was obliged  to sit down in the pulpit, and drop a tear.    After a pause, and the Lord having vouchsafed to compose me, I rose up,  and gave out that anthem of triumph, the 124th psalm, the singing of  which brought the congregation round to themselves; but still I felt that  I could not preach as I had meant to do; therefore I only said a few  words of prayer, and singing another psalm, dismissed the congregation.          CHAPTER XXIV  YEAR 1783      THIS was another Sabbath year of my ministry.  It has left me nothing to  record but a silent increase of prosperity in the parish.  I myself had  now in the bank more than a thousand pounds, and every thing was thriving  around.  My two bairns, Gilbert, that is now the merchant in Glasgow, was  grown into a sturdy ramplor laddie, and Janet, that is married upon Dr.  Kittleword, the minister of Swappington, was as fine a lassie for her  years as the eyes of a parent could desire to see.    Shortly after the news of the peace, an event at which all gave  themselves up to joy, a thing happened among us that at the time caused  much talk; but although very dreadful, was yet not so serious, some how  or other, as such an awsome doing should have been.  Poor Jenny Gaffaw  happened to take a heavy cold, and soon thereafter died.  Meg went about  from house to house, begging dead-clothes, and got the body straighted in  a wonderful decent manner, with a plate of earth and salt placed upon  it—an admonitory type of mortality and eternal life that has  ill-advisedly gone out of fashion.  When I heard of this, I could not but  go to see how a creature that was not thought possessed of a grain of  understanding, could have done so much herself.  On entering the door, I  beheld Meg sitting with two or three of the neighbouring kimmers, and the  corpse laid out on a bed.  “Come awa’, sir,” said Meg; “this is an  altered house.  They’re gane that keepit it bein; but, sir, we maun a’  come to this—we maun pay the debt o’ nature—death is a grim creditor, and  a doctor but brittle bail when the hour of reckoning’s at han’!  What a  pity it is, mother, that you’re now dead, for here’s the minister come to  see you.  Oh, sir! but she would have had a proud heart to see you in her  dwelling, for she had a genteel turn, and would not let me, her only  daughter, mess or mell wi’ the lathron lasses of the clachan.  Ay, ay,  she brought me up with care, and edicated me for a lady: nae coarse wark  darkened my lily-white hands.  But I maun work now; I maun dree the  penalty of man.”    Having stopped some time, listening to the curious maunnering of Meg, I  rose to come away; but she laid her hand on my arm, saying, “No, sir, ye  maun taste before ye gang!  My mother had aye plenty in her life, nor  shall her latter day be needy.”    Accordingly, Meg, with all the due formality common on such occasions,  produced a bottle of water, and a dram-glass, which she filled and  tasted, then presented to me, at the same time offering me a bit of bread  on a slate.  It was a consternation to everybody how the daft creature  had learnt all the ceremonies, which she performed in a manner past the  power of pen to describe, making the solemnity of death, by her strange  mockery, a kind of merriment, that was more painful than sorrow; but some  spirits are gifted with a faculty of observation, that, by the strength  of a little fancy, enables them to make a wonderful and truthlike  semblance of things and events, which they never saw, and poor Meg seemed  to have this gift.    The same night, the session having provided a coffin, the body was put  in, and removed to Mr. Mutchkin’s brewhouse, where the lads and lassies  kept the late-wake.    Saving this, the year flowed in a calm, and we floated on in the stream  of time towards the great ocean of eternity, like ducks and geese in the  river’s tide, that are carried down without being sensible of the speed  of the current.  Alas! we have not wings like them, to fly back to the  place we set out from.          CHAPTER XXV  YEAR 1784      I HAVE ever thought that this was a bright year, truly an Ann. Dom., for  in it many of the lads came home that had listed to be soldiers; and Mr.  Howard, that was the midshipman, being now a captain of a man-of-war,  came down from England and married Effie Malcolm, and took her up with  him to London, where she wrote to her mother, that she found his family  people of great note, and more kind to her than she could write.  By this  time, also, Major Macadam was made a colonel, and lived with his lady in  Edinburgh, where they were much respected by the genteeler classes, Mrs.  Macadam being considered a great unco among them for all manner of  ladylike ornaments, she having been taught every sort of perfection in  that way by the old lady, who was educated at the court of France, and  was, from her birth, a person of quality.  In this year, also, Captain  Malcolm, her brother, married a daughter of a Glasgow merchant, so that  Mrs. Malcolm, in her declining years, had the prospect of a bright  setting; but nothing could change the sober Christianity of her settled  mind; and although she was strongly invited, both by the Macadams and the  Howards, to see their felicity, she ever declined the same, saying—“No!  I have been long out of the world, or rather, I have never been in it; my  ways are not as theirs; and although I ken their hearts would be glad to  be kind to me, I might fash their servants, or their friends might think  me unlike other folk, by which, instead of causing pleasure,  mortification might ensue; so I will remain in my own house, trusting  that, when they can spare the time, they will come and see me.”    There was a spirit of true wisdom in this resolution, for it required a  forbearance that in weaker minds would have relaxed; but though a person  of a most slender and delicate frame of body, she was a Judith in  fortitude; and in all the fortune that seemed now smiling upon her, she  never was lifted up, but bore always that pale and meek look, which gave  a saintliness to her endeavours in the days of her suffering and poverty.    But when we enjoy most, we have least to tell.  I look back on this year  as on a sunny spot in the valley, amidst the shadows of the clouds of  time; and I have nothing to record, save the remembrance of welcomings  and weddings, and a meeting of bairns and parents, that the wars and the  waters had long raged between.  Contentment within the bosom, lent a  livelier grace to the countenance of Nature; and everybody said, that in  this year the hedges were greener than common, the gowans brighter on the  brae, and the heads of the statelier trees adorned with a richer coronal  of leaves and blossoms.  All things were animated with the gladness of  thankfulness, and testified to the goodness of their Maker.          CHAPTER XXVI  YEAR 1785      WELL may we say, in the pious words of my old friend and neighbour, the  Reverend Mr. Keekie of Loupinton, that the world is such a  wheel-carriage, that it might very properly be called the WHIRL’D.  This  reflection was brought home to me in a very striking manner, while I was  preparing a discourse for my people, to be preached on the anniversary  day of my placing, in which I took a view of what had passed in the  parish during the five-and-twenty years that I had been, by the grace of  God, the pastor thereof.  The bairns, that were bairns when I came among  my people, were ripened unto parents, and a new generation was swelling  in the bud around me.  But it is what happened that I have to give an  account of.    This year the Lady Macadam’s jointure-house that was, having been long  without a tenant, a Mr. Cayenne and his family, American loyalists, came  and took it, and settled among us for a time.  His wife was a clever  woman, and they had two daughters, Miss Virginia and Miss Carolina; but  he was himself an ettercap, a perfect spunkie of passion, as ever was  known in town or country.  His wife had a terrible time o’t with him, and  yet the unhappy man had a great share of common sense, and, saving the  exploits of his unmanageable temper, was an honest and creditable  gentleman.  Of his humour we soon had a sample, as I shall relate at  length all about it.    Shortly after he came to the parish, Mrs. Balwhidder and me waited upon  the family to pay our respects, and Mr. Cayenne, in a free and hearty  manner, insisted on us staying to dinner.  His wife, I could see, was not  satisfied with this, not being, as I discerned afterwards, prepared to  give an entertainment to strangers; however, we fell into the misfortune  of staying, and nothing could exceed the happiness of Mr. Cayenne.  I  thought him one of the blithest bodies I had ever seen, and had no notion  that he was such a tap of tow as in the sequel he proved himself.    As there was something extra to prepare, the dinner was a little longer  of being on the table than usual, at which he began to fash, and every  now and then took a turn up and down the room, with his hands behind his  back, giving a short melancholious whistle.  At length the dinner was  served, but it was more scanty than he had expected, and this upset his  good-humour altogether.  Scarcely had I asked the blessing when he began  to storm at his blackamoor servant, who was, however, used to his way,  and did his work without minding him; but by some neglect there was no  mustard down, which Mr. Cayenne called for in the voice of a tempest, and  one of the servant lassies came in with the pot, trembling.  It happened  that, as it had not been used for a day or two before, the lid was  clagged, and, as it were, glued in, so that Mr. Cayenne could not get it  out, which put him quite wud, and he attempted to fling it at Sambo, the  black lad’s head, but it stottit against the wall, and the lid flying  open, the whole mustard flew in his own face, which made him a sight not  to be spoken of.  However it calmed him; but really, as I had never seen  such a man before, I could not but consider the accident as a  providential reproof, and trembled to think what greater evil might fall  out in the hands of a man so left to himself in the intemperance of  passion.    But the worst thing about Mr. Cayenne was his meddling with matters in  which he had no concern; for he had a most irksome nature, and could not  be at rest, so that he was truly a thorn in our side.  Among other of his  strange doings, was the part he took in the proceedings of the session,  with which he had as little to do, in a manner, as the man in the moon;  but having no business on his hands, he attended every sederunt, and from  less to more, having no self-government, he began to give his opinion in  our deliberations; and often bred us trouble, by causing strife to arise.    It happened, as the time of the summer occasion was drawing near, that it  behoved us to make arrangements about the assistance; and upon the  suggestion of the elders, to which I paid always the greatest deference,  I invited Mr. Keekie of Loupinton, who was a sound preacher, and a great  expounder of the kittle parts of the Old Testament, being a man well  versed in the Hebrew and etymologies, for which he was much reverenced by  the old people that delighted to search the Scriptures.  I had also  written to Mr. Sprose of Annock, a preacher of another sort, being a  vehement and powerful thresher of the word, making the chaff and vain  babbling of corrupt commentators to fly from his hand.  He was not,  however, so well liked, as he wanted that connect method which is needful  to the enforcing of doctrine.  But he had never been among us, and it was  thought it would be a godly treat to the parish to let the people hear  him.  Besides Mr. Sprose, Mr. Waikle of Gowanry, a quiet hewer out of the  image of holiness in the heart, was likewise invited, all in addition to  our old stoops from the adjacent parishes.    None of these three preachers were in any estimation with Mr. Cayenne,  who had only heard each of them once; and he, happening to be present in  the session-house at the time, enquired how we had settled.  I thought  this not a very orderly question, but I gave him a civil answer, saying,  that, Mr. Keekie of Loupinton would preach on the morning of the  fast-day, Mr. Sprose of Annock in the afternoon, and Mr. Waikle of  Gowanry on the Saturday.  Never shall I or the elders, while the breath  of life is in our bodies, forget the reply.  Mr. Cayenne struck the table  like a clap of thunder, and cried, “Mr. Keekie of Loupinton, and Mr.  Sprose of Annock, and Mr. Waikle of Gowanry, and all suck trash, may go  to — and be —!” and out of the house he bounced, like a hand-ball  stotting on a stone.    The elders and me were confounded, and for some time we could not speak,  but looked at each other, doubtful if our ears heard aright.  At long and  length I came to myself; and, in the strength of God, took my place at  the table, and said, this was an outrageous impiety not to be borne,  which all the elders agreed to; and we thereupon came to a resolve, which  I dictated myself, wherein we debarred Mr. Cayenne from ever after  entering, unless summoned, the session-house, the which resolve we  directed the session-clerk to send to him direct, and thus we vindicated  the insulted privileges of the church.    Mr. Cayenne had cooled before he got home, and our paper coming to him in  his appeased blood, he immediately came to the manse, and made a contrite  apology for his hasty temper, which I reported in due time and form, to  the session, and there the matter ended.  But here was an example plain  to be seen of the truth of the old proverb, that as one door shuts  another opens; for scarcely were we in quietness by the decease of that  old light-headed woman, the Lady Macadam, till a full equivalent for her  was given in this hot and fiery Mr. Cayenne.          CHAPTER XXVII  YEAR 1786      FROM the day of my settlement, I had resolved, in order to win the  affections of my people, and to promote unison among the heritors, to be  of as little expense to the parish as possible; but by this time the  manse had fallen into a sore state of decay—the doors were wormed on the  hinges—the casements of the windows chattered all the winter, like the  teeth of a person perishing with cold, so that we had no comfort in the  house; by which, at the urgent instigations of Mrs. Balwhidder, I was  obligated to represent our situation to the session.  I would rather,  having so much saved money in the bank, paid the needful repairs myself,  than have done this, but she said it would be a rank injustice to our own  family; and her father, Mr. Kibbock, who was very long-headed, with more  than a common man’s portion of understanding, pointed out to me, that, as  my life was but in my lip, it would be a wrong thing towards whomsoever  was ordained to be my successor, to use the heritors to the custom of the  minister paying for the reparations of the manse, as it might happen he  might not be so well able to afford it as me.  So in a manner, by their  persuasion, and the constraint of the justice of the case, I made a  report of the infirmities both of doors and windows, as well as of the  rotten state of the floors, which were constantly in want of cobbling.  Over and above all, I told them of the sarking of the roof, which was as  frush as a puddock-stool; insomuch, that in every blast some of the pins  lost their grip, and the slates came hurling off.    The heritors were accordingly convened, and, after some deliberation,  they proposed that the house should be seen to, and whitewashed and  painted; and I thought this might do, for I saw they were terrified at  the expense of a thorough repair; but when I went home and repeated to  Mrs. Balwhidder what had been said at the meeting, and my thankfulness at  getting the heritors’ consent to do so much, she was excessively angry,  and told me, that all the painting and whitewashing in the world would  avail nothing, for that the house was as a sepulchre full of rottenness;  and she sent for Mr. Kibbock, her father, to confer with him on the way  of getting the matter put to rights.    Mr. Kibbock came, and hearing of what had passed, pondered for some time,  and then said, “All was very right! the minister (meaning me) has just to  get tradesmen to look at the house, and write out their opinion of what  it needs.  There will be plaster to mend; so, before painting, he will  get a plasterer.  There will be a slater wanted; he has just to get a  slater’s estimate, and a wright’s, and so forth, and when all is done, he  will lay them before the session and the heritors, who, no doubt, will  direct the reparations to go forward.”                              [Picture: The Roadman]    This was very pawkie, counselling, of Mr. Kibbock, and I did not see  through it at the time, but did as he recommended, and took all the  different estimates, when they came in, to the session.  The elders  commended my prudence exceedingly for so doing, before going to work; and  one of them asked me what the amount of the whole would be, but I had not  cast it up.  Some of the heritors thought that a hundred pounds would be  sufficient for the outlay; but judge of our consternation, when, in  counting up all the sums of the different estimates together, we found  them well on towards a thousand pounds.  “Better big a new house at once,  than do this!” cried all the elders, by which I then perceived the  draughtiness of Mr. Kibbock’s advice.  Accordingly, another meeting of  the heritors was summoned, and after a great deal of controversy, it was  agreed that a new manse should be erected; and, shortly after, we  contracted with Thomas Trowel, the mason to build one for six hundred  pounds, with all the requisite appurtenances, by which a clear gain was  saved to the parish, by the foresight of Mr. Kibbock, to the amount of  nearly four hundred pounds.  But the heritors did not mean to have  allowed the sort of repair that his plan comprehended.  He was, however,  a far forecasting man; the like of him for natural parts not being in our  country side; and nobody could get the whip-hand of him, either in a  bargain or an improvement, when he once was sensible of the advantage.  He was, indeed, a blessing to the shire, both by his example as a farmer,  and by his sound and discreet advice in the contentions of his  neighbours, being a man, as was a saying among the commonality, “wiser  than the law and the fifteen Lords of Edinburgh.”    The building of the new manse occasioned a heavy cess on the heritors,  which made them overly ready to pick holes in the coats of me and the  elders; so that, out of my forbearance and delicacy in time past, grew a  lordliness on their part, that was an ill return for the years that I had  endured no little inconveniency for their sake.  It was not in my heart  or principles to harm the hair of a dog; but when I discerned the  austerity with which they were disposed to treat their minister, I  bethought me that, for the preservation of what was due to the  establishment and the upholding of the decent administration of religion,  I ought to set my face against the sordid intolerance by which they were  actuated.  This notion I weighed well before divulging it to any person;  but when I had assured myself as to the rectitude thereof, I rode over  one day to Mr. Kibbock’s, and broke my mind to him about claiming out of  the teinds an augmentation of my stipend, not because I needed it, but in  case, after me, some bare and hungry gorbie of the Lord should be sent  upon the parish, in no such condition to plea with the heritors as I was.  Mr. Kibbock highly approved of my intent; and by his help, after much  tribulation, I got an augmentation both in glebe and income; and to mark  my reason for what I did, I took upon me to keep and clothe the wives and  orphans of the parish, who lost their breadwinners in the American war.  But for all that, the heritors spoke of me as an avaricious Jew, and made  the hard-won fruits of Mrs. Balwhidder’s great thrift and good management  a matter of reproach against me.  Few of them would come to the church,  but stayed away, to the detriment of their own souls hereafter, in order,  as they thought, to punish me; so that, in the course of this year, there  was a visible decay of the sense of religion among the better orders of  the parish, and, as will be seen in the sequel, their evil example  infected the minds of many of the rising generation.    It was in this year that Mr. Cayenne bought the mailing of the Wheatrigs,  but did not begin to build his house till the following spring; for being  ill to please with a plan, he fell out with the builders, and on one  occasion got into such a passion with Mr. Trowel, the mason, that he  struck him a blow on the face, for which he was obligated to make  atonement.  It was thought the matter would have been carried before the  Lords; but, by the mediation of Mr. Kibbock, with my helping hand, a  reconciliation was brought about, Mr. Cayenne indemnifying the mason with  a sum of money to say no more anent it; after which, he employed him to  build his house, a thing that no man could have thought possible, who  reflected on the enmity between them.          CHAPTER XXVIII  YEAR 1787      THERE had been, as I have frequently observed, a visible improvement  going on in the parish.  From the time of the making of the toll-road,  every new house that was built in the clachan was built along that road.  Among other changes hereby caused, the Lady Macadam’s jointure-house that  was, which stood in a pleasant parterre, inclosed within a stone wall and  an iron gate, having a pillar with a pineapple head on each side, came to  be in the middle of the town.  While Mr. Cayenne inhabited the same, it  was maintained in good order; but on his flitting to his own new house on  the Wheatrigs, the parterre was soon overrun with weeds, and it began to  wear the look of a waste place.  Robert Toddy, who then kept the  change-house, and who had, from the lady’s death, rented the coach-house  for stabling, in this juncture thought of it for an inn; so he set his  own house to Thomas Treddles the weaver, whose son, William, is now the  great Glasgow manufacturer, that has cotton-mills and steam-engines, and  took, “the Place,” as it was called, and had a fine sign, THE CROSS-KEYS,  painted and put up in golden characters, by which it became one of the  most noted inns anywhere to be seen; and the civility of Mrs. Toddy was  commended by all strangers.  But although this transmutation from a  change-house to an inn was a vast amendment, in a manner, to the parish,  there was little amendment of manners thereby; for the farmer lads began  to hold dancings and other riotous proceedings there, and to bring, as it  were, the evil practices of towns into the heart of the country.  All  sort of licence was allowed as to drink and hours; and the edifying  example of Mr. Mutchkins and his pious family, was no longer held up to  the imitation of the wayfaring man.    Saving the mutation of “the Place” into an inn, nothing very remarkable  happened in this year.  We got into our new manse about the middle of  March; but it was rather damp, being new plastered, and it caused me to  have a severe attack of the rheumatics in the fall of the year.    I should not, in my notations, forget to mark a new luxury that got in  among the commonality at this time.  By the opening of new roads, and the  traffic thereon with carts and carriers, and by our young men that were  sailors going to the Clyde, and sailing to Jamaica and the West Indies,  heaps of sugar and coffee-beans were brought home, while many, among the  kail-stocks and cabbages in their yards, had planted groset and berry  bushes; which two things happening together, the fashion to make jam and  jelly, which hitherto had been only known in the kitchens and  confectionaries of the gentry, came to be introduced into the clachan.  All this, however, was not without a plausible pretext; for it was found  that jelly was an excellent medicine for a sore throat, and jam a remedy  as good as London candy for a cough, or a cold, or a shortness of breath.  I could not, however, say that this gave me so much concern as the  smuggling trade, only it occasioned a great fasherie to Mrs. Balwhidder;  for, in the berry time, there was no end to the borrowing of her  brass-pan to make jelly and jam, till Mrs. Toddy of the Cross-Keys bought  one, which, in its turn, came into request, and saved ours.    It was in the Martinmas quarter of this year that I got the first payment  of my augmentation.  Having no desire to rip up old sores, I shall say no  more anent it, the worst being anticipated in my chronicle of the last  year; but there was a thing happened in the payment that occasioned a  vexation at the time, of a very disagreeable nature.  Daft Meg Gaffaw,  who, from the tragical death of her mother, was a privileged subject,  used to come to the manse on the Saturdays for a meal of meat; and so it  fell out that as, by some neglect of mine, no steps had been taken to  regulate the disposal of the victual that constituted the means of the  augmentation, some of the heritors, in an ungracious temper, sent what  they called the tithe-ball (the Lord knows it was not the fiftieth!) to  the manse, where I had no place to put it.  This fell out on a Saturday  night, when I was busy with my sermon, thinking not of silver or gold,  but of much better; so that I was greatly molested and disturbed thereby.  Daft Meg, who sat by the kitchen chimley-lug, hearing a’, said nothing  for a time; but when she saw how Mrs. Balwhidder and me were put to, she  cried out with a loud voice, like a soul under the inspiration of  prophecy—“When the widow’s cruse had filled all the vessels in the house,  the Lord stopped the increase.  Verily, verily, I say unto you, if your  barns be filled, and your girnell-kists can hold no more, seek till ye  shall find the tume basins of the poor, and therein pour the corn, and  the oil, and the wine of your abundance; so shall ye be blessed of the  Lord.”  The which words I took for an admonition, and directing the sacks  to be brought into the dining-room and other chambers of the manse, I  sent off the heritors’ servants, that had done me this prejudice, with an  unexpected thankfulness.  But this, as I afterwards was informed, both  them and their masters attributed to the greedy grasp of avarice, with  which they considered me as misled; and having said so, nothing could  exceed their mortification on Monday, when they heard (for they were of  those who had deserted the kirk) that I had given by the precentor notice  to every widow in the parish that was in need, to come to the manse and  she would receive her portion of the partitioning of the augmentation.  Thus, without any offence on my part, saving the strictness of justice,  was a division made between me and the heritors; but the people were with  me; and my own conscience was with me; and though the fronts of the lofts  and the pews of the heritors were but thinly filled, I trusted that a  good time was coming, when the gentry would see the error of their way.  So I bent the head of resignation to the Lord, and, assisted by the  wisdom of Mr. Kibbock, adhered to the course I had adopted; but at the  close of the year my heart was sorrowful for the schism; and my prayer on  Hogmanay was one of great bitterness of soul, that such an evil had come  to pass.          CHAPTER XXIX  YEAR 1788      IT had been often remarked by ingenious men, that the Brawl burn, which  ran through the parish, though a small, was yet a rapid stream, and had a  wonderful capability for damming, and to turn mills.  From the time that  the Irville water deserted its channel this brook grew into repute, and  several mills and dams had been erected on its course.  In this year a  proposal came from Glasgow to build a cotton-mill on its banks, beneath  the Witch-linn, which being on a corner of the Wheatrig, the property of  Mr. Cayenne, he not only consented thereto, but took a part in the profit  or loss therein; and, being a man of great activity, though we thought  him, for many a day, a serpent-plague sent upon the parish, he proved  thereby one of our greatest benefactors.  The cotton-mill was built, and  a spacious fabric it was—nothing like it had been seen before in our day  and generation—and, for the people that were brought to work in it, a new  town was built in the vicinity, which Mr. Cayenne, the same being founded  on his land, called Cayenneville, the name of the plantation in Virginia  that had been taken from him by the rebellious Americans.  From that day  Fortune was lavish of her favours upon him; his property swelled, and  grew in the most extraordinary manner, and the whole country side was  stirring with a new life.  For, when the mill was set a-going, he got  weavers of muslin established in Cayenneville; and shortly after, but  that did not take place till the year following, he brought women all the  way from the neighbourhood of Manchester, in England, to teach the lassie  bairns in our old clachan tambouring.    Some of the ancient families, in their turreted houses, were not pleased  with this innovation, especially when they saw the handsome dwellings  that were built for the weavers of the mills, and the unstinted hand that  supplied the wealth required for the carrying on of the business.  It  sank their pride into insignificance, and many of them would almost  rather have wanted the rise that took place in the value of their lands,  than have seen this incoming of what they called o’er-sea speculation.  But, saving the building of the cotton-mill, and the beginning of  Cayenneville, nothing more memorable happened in this year, still it was  nevertheless a year of a great activity.  The minds of men were excited  to new enterprises; a new genius, as it were, had descended upon the  earth, and there was an erect and outlooking spirit abroad that was not  to be satisfied with the taciturn regularity of ancient affairs.  Even  Miss Sabrina Hooky, the schoolmistress, though now waned from her  meridian, was touched with the enlivening rod, and set herself to learn  and to teach tambouring, in such a manner as to supersede by precept and  example that old time-honoured functionary, as she herself called it, the  spinning-wheel, proving, as she did one night to Mr. Kibbock and me,  that, if more money could be made by a woman tambouring than by spinning,  it was better for her to tambour than to spin.    But, in the midst of all this commercing and manufacturing, I began to  discover signs of decay in the wonted simplicity of our country ways.  Among the cotton-spinners and muslin weavers of Cayenneville were several  unsatisfied and ambitious spirits, who clubbed together, and got a London  newspaper to the Cross-Keys, where they were nightly in the habit of  meeting and debating about the affairs of the French, which were then  gathering towards a head.  They were represented to me as lads by common  in capacity, but with unsettled notions of religion.  They were, however,  quiet and orderly; and some of them since, at Glasgow, Paisley, and  Manchester, even, I am told, in London, have grown into a topping way.    It seems they did not like my manner of preaching, and on that account  absented themselves from public worship; which, when I heard, I sent for  some of them, to convince them of their error with regard to the truth of  divers points of doctrine; but they confounded me with their objections,  and used my arguments, which were the old and orthodox proven opinions of  the Divinity Hall, as if they had been the light sayings of a vain man.  So that I was troubled, fearing that some change would ensue to my  people, who had hitherto lived amidst the boughs and branches of the  gospel unmolested by the fowler’s snare, and I set myself to watch  narrowly, and with a vigilant eye, what would come to pass.    There was a visible increase among us of worldly prosperity in the course  of this year; insomuch that some of the farmers, who were in the custom  of taking their vendibles to the neighbouring towns on the Tuesdays, the  Wednesdays, and Fridays, were led to open a market on the Saturdays in  our own clachan, the which proved a great convenience.  But I cannot take  it upon me to say, whether this can be said to have well begun in the  present Ann. Dom., although I know that in the summer of the ensuing year  it was grown into a settled custom; which I well recollect by the  Macadams coming with their bairns to see Mrs. Malcolm, their mother,  suddenly on a Saturday afternoon; on which occasion me and Mrs.  Balwhidder were invited to dine with them, and Mrs. Malcolm bought in the  market for the dinner that day, both mutton and fowls, such as twenty  years before could not have been got for love or money on such a pinch.  Besides, she had two bottles of red and white wine from the Cross-Keys,  luxuries which, saving in the Breadland House in its best days, could not  have been had in the whole parish, but must have been brought from a  borough town; for Eaglesham Castle is not within the bounds of  Dalmailing, and my observe does not apply to the stock and stores of that  honourable mansion, but only to the dwellings of our own heritors, who  were in general straitened in their circumstances, partly with upsetting,  and partly by the eating rust of family pride, which hurt the edge of  many a clever fellow among them, that would have done well in the way of  trade, but sunk into divors for the sake of their genteelity.          CHAPTER XXX  YEAR 1789      THIS I have always reflected upon as one of our blessed years.  It was  not remarkable for any extraordinary occurrence; but there was a  hopefulness in the minds of men, and a planning of new undertakings, of  which, whatever may be the upshot, the devising is ever rich in the  cheerful anticipations of good.    Another new line of road was planned, for a shorter cut to the  cotton-mill, from the main road to Glasgow, and a public-house was opened  in Cayenneville: the latter, however, was not an event that gave me much  satisfaction; but it was a convenience to the inhabitants, and the  carriers that brought the cotton-bags and took away the yarn twice  a-week, needed a place of refreshment.  And there was a stage-coach set  up thrice every week from Ayr, that passed through the town, by which it  was possible to travel to Glasgow between breakfast and dinner time, a  thing that could not, when I came to the parish, have been thought within  the compass of man.    This stage-coach I thought one of the greatest conveniences that had been  established among us; and it enabled Mrs. Balwhidder to send a basket of  her fresh butter into the Glasgow market, by which, in the spring and the  fall of the year, she got a great price; for the Glasgow merchants are  fond of excellent eatables, and the payment was aye ready money—Tam  Whirlit the driver paying for the one basket when he took up the other.    In this year William Malcolm, the youngest son of the widow, having been  some time a tutor in a family in the east country, came to see his  mother, as indeed he had done every year from the time he went to the  college; but this occasion was made remarkable by his preaching in my  pulpit.  His old acquaintance were curious to hear him; and I myself had  a sort of a wish likewise, being desirous to know how far he was  orthodox; so I thought fit, on the suggestion of one of the elders, to  ask him to preach one day for me, which, after some fleeching, he  consented to do.  I think, however, there was a true modesty in his  diffidence, although his reason was a weak one, being lest he might not  satisfy his mother, who had as yet never heard him.  Accordingly, on the  Sabbath after, he did preach, and the kirk was well packed, and I was not  one of the least attentive of the congregation.  His sermon assuredly was  well put together and there was nothing to object to in his doctrine; but  the elderly people thought his language rather too Englified, which I  thought likewise; for I never could abide that the plain auld Kirk of  Scotland, with her sober presbyterian simplicity, should borrow, either  in word or in deed, from the language of the prelatic hierarchy of  England.  Nevertheless, the younger part of the congregation were loud in  his praise, saying, there had not been heard before such a style of  language in our side of the country.  As for Mrs. Malcolm, his mother,  when I spoke to her anent the same, she said but little, expressing only  her hope that his example would be worthy of his precepts; so that, upon  the whole, it was a satisfaction to us all, that he was likely to prove a  stoop and upholding pillar to the Kirk of Scotland.  And his mother had  the satisfaction, before she died, to see him a placed minister, and his  name among the authors of his country; for he published at Edinburgh a  volume of Moral Essays, of which he sent me a pretty bound copy, and they  were greatly creditable to his pen, though lacking somewhat of that birr  and smeddum that is the juice and flavour of books of that sort.          CHAPTER XXXI  YEAR 1790      THE features of this Ann. Dom. partook of the character of its  predecessor.  Several new houses were added to the clachan; Cayenneville  was spreading out with weavers’ shops, and growing up fast into a town.  In some respects it got the start of ours; for one day, when I was going  to dine with Mr. Cayenne at Wheatrig House, not a little to my amazement,  did I behold a bookseller’s shop opened there, with sticks of red and  black wax, pouncet-boxes, pens, pocket-books, and new publications, in  the window, such as the like of was only to be seen in cities and borough  towns.  And it was lighted at night by a patent lamp, which shed a  wonderful beam, burning oil, and having no smoke.  The man sold likewise  perfumery, powder-puffs, trinkets, and Dublin dolls, besides penknives,  Castile soap, and walking-sticks, together with a prodigy of other  luxuries too tedious to mention.    Upon conversing with the man, for I was enchanted to go into this  phenomenon, for as no less could I regard it, he told me that he had a  correspondence with London, and could get me down any book published  there within the same month in which it came out; and he showed me divers  of the newest come out, of which I did not read even in the _Scots  Magazine_ till more than three months after, although I had till then  always considered that work as most interesting for its early  intelligence.  But what I was most surprised to hear, was, that he took  in a daily London newspaper for the spinners and weavers, who paid him a  penny a-week a-piece for the same; they being all greatly taken up with  what, at the time, was going on in France.    This bookseller in the end, however, proved a whawp in our nest, for he  was in league with some of the English reformers; and when the story took  wind three years after, concerning the plots and treasons of the  corresponding societies and democrats, he was fain to make a moonlight  flitting, leaving his wife for a time to manage his affairs.  I could  not, however, think any ill of the man notwithstanding; for he had very  correct notions of right and justice, in a political sense, and when he  came into the parish he was as orderly and well-behaved as any other  body; and conduct is a test that I have always found as good for a man’s  principles as professions.  Nor, at the time of which I am speaking, was  there any of that dread or fear of reforming the government that has  since been occasioned by the wild and wasteful hand which the French  employed in their revolution.    But, among other improvements, I should mention that a Doctor Marigold  came and settled in Cayenneville, a small, round, happy-tempered man,  whose funny stories were far better liked than his drugs.  There was a  doubt among some of the weavers if he was a skilful Esculapian; and this  doubt led to their holding out an inducement to another medical man, Dr.  Tanzey, to settle there likewise, by which it grew into a saying, that at  Cayenneville there was a doctor for health as well as sickness; for Dr.  Marigold was one of the best hands in the country at a pleasant  punch-bowl, while Dr. Tanzey had all the requisite knowledge for the  faculty for the bedside.    It was in this year that the hour-plate and hand on the kirk steeple were  renewed, as indeed, may yet be seen by the date, though it be again  greatly in want of fresh gilding; for it was by my advice that the  figures of the Ann. Dom. were placed one in each corner.  In this year,  likewise, the bridge over the Brawl burn was built—a great convenience,  in the winter time, to the parishioners that lived on the north side; for  when there happened to be a spait on the Sunday, it kept them from the  kirk; but I did not find that the bridge mended the matter, till after  the conclusion of the war against the democrats, and the beginning of  that which we are now waging with Boney, their child and champion.  It  is, indeed, wonderful to think of the occultation of grace that was  taking place about this time, throughout the whole bound of Christendom;  for I could mark a visible darkness of infidelity spreading in the corner  of the vineyard committed to my keeping, and a falling away of the vines  from their wonted props and confidence in the truths of Revelation.  But  I said nothing.  I knew that the faith could not be lost, and that it  would be found purer and purer the more it was tried; and this I have  lived to see, many now being zealous members of the church, that were  abundantly lukewarm at the period of which I am now speaking.          CHAPTER XXXII  YEAR 1791      IN the spring of this year, I took my son Gilbert into Glasgow, to place  him in a counting-house.  As he had no inclination for any of the learned  professions, and not having been there from the time when I was sent to  the General Assembly, I cannot express my astonishment at the great  improvements, surpassing far all that was done in our part of the  country, which I thought was not to be paralleled.  When I came  afterwards to reflect on my simplicity in this, it was clear to me that  we should not judge of the rest of the world by what we see going on  around ourselves, but walk abroad into other parts, and thereby enlarge  our sphere of observation, as well as ripen our judgment of things.    But although there was no doubt a great and visible increase of the city,  loftier buildings on all sides, and streets that spread their arms far  into the embraces of the country, I thought the looks of the population  were impaired, and that there was a greater proportion of long white  faces in the Trongate, than when I attended the Divinity class.  These, I  was told, were the weavers and others concerned in the cotton trade,  which I could well believe, for they were very like in their looks to the  men of Cayenneville; but from living in a crowded town, and not breathing  a wholesome country air between their tasks, they had a stronger cast of  unhealthy melancholy.  I was therefore very glad that Providence had  placed in my hand the pastoral staff of a country parish; for it cut me  to the heart to see so many young men, in the rising prime of life,  already in the arms of a pale consumption.  “If, therefore,” said I to  Mrs. Balwhidder, when I returned home to the manse, “we live, as it were,  within the narrow circle of ignorance, we are spared from the pain of  knowing many an evil; and, surely, in much knowledge there is sadness of  heart.”    But the main effect of this was to make me do all in my power to keep my  people contented with their lowly estate; for in that same spirit of  improvement, which was so busy every where, I could discern something  like a shadow, that showed it was not altogether of that pure advantage  which avarice led all so eagerly to believe.  Accordingly, I began a  series of sermons on the evil and vanity of riches, and, for the most  part of the year, pointed out in what manner they led the possessor to  indulge in sinful luxuries, and how indulgence begat desire, and desire  betrayed integrity and corrupted the heart; making it evident that the  rich man was liable to forget his unmerited obligations to God, and to  oppress the laborious and the needful when he required their services.    Little did I imagine, in thus striving to keep aloof the ravenous wolf  Ambition from my guileless flock, that I was giving cause for many to  think me an enemy to the king and government, and a perverter of  Christianity, to suit levelling doctrines.  But so it was.  Many of the  heritors considered me a blackneb, though I knew it not, but went on in  the course of my duty, thinking only how best to preserve peace on earth  and goodwill towards men.  I saw, however, an altered manner in the  deportment of several, with whom I had long lived in friendly terms.  It  was not marked enough to make me inquire the cause, but sufficiently  plain to affect my ease of mind.  Accordingly, about the end of this  year, I fell into a dull way: my spirit was subdued, and at times I was  aweary of the day, and longed for the night, when I might close my eyes  in peaceful slumbers.  I missed my son Gilbert, who had been a companion  to me in the long nights, while his mother was busy with the lasses, and  their ceaseless wheels and cardings, in the kitchen.  Often could I have  found it in my heart to have banned that never-ceasing industry, and to  tell Mrs. Balwhidder, that the married state was made for something else  than to make napery and beetle blankets; but it was her happiness to keep  all at work, and she had no pleasure in any other way of life, so I sat  many a night by the fireside with resignation; sometimes in the study,  and sometimes in the parlour, and, as I was doing nothing, Mrs.  Balwhidder said it was needless to light the candle.  Our daughter Janet  was in this time at a boarding-school in Ayr, so that I was really a most  solitary married man.          CHAPTER XXXIII  YEAR 1792      WHEN the spring in this year began to brighten on the brae, the cloud of  dulness that had darkened and oppressed me all the winter somewhat melted  away, and I could now and then joke again at the never-ending toil and  trouble of that busiest of all bees, the second Mrs. Balwhidder.  But  still I was far from being right: a small matter affected me, and I was  overly given to walking by myself, and musing on things that I could tell  nothing about—my thoughts were just the rack of a dream without form, and  driving witlessly as the smoke that mounteth up, and is lost in the airy  heights of the sky.    Heeding little of what was going on in the clachan, and taking no  interest in the concerns of any body, I would have been contented to die,  but I had no ail about me.  An accident, however, fell out, that, by  calling on me for an effort, had the blessed influence of clearing my  vapours almost entirely away.    One morning as I was walking on the sunny side of the road, where the  footpath was in the next year made to the cotton-mill, I fell in with Mr.  Cayenne, who was seemingly much fashed—a small matter could do that at  any time; and he came up to me with a red face and an angry eye.  It was  not my intent to speak to him; for I was grown loth to enter into  conversation with any body, so I bowed and passed on.  “What,” cried Mr.  Cayenne, “and will you not speak to me?”  I turned round, and said  meekly, “Mr. Cayenne, I have no objections to speak to you; but having  nothing particular to say, it did not seem necessary just now.”    He looked at me like a gled, and in a minute exclaimed, “Mad, by Jupiter!  as mad as a March hare!”  He then entered into conversation with me, and  said, that he had noticed me an altered man, and was just so far on his  way to the manse, to enquire what had befallen me.  So, from less to  more, we entered into the marrow of my case; and I told him how I had  observed the estranged countenances of some of the heritors; at which he  swore an oath, that they were a parcel of the damn’dest boobies in the  country, and told me how they had taken it into their heads that I was a  leveller.  “But I know you better,” said Mr. Cayenne, “and have stood up  for you as an honest conscientious man, though I don’t much like your  humdrum preaching.  However, let that pass; I insist upon your dining  with me to-day, when some of these arrant fools are to be with us, and  the devil’s in’t if I don’t make you friends with them.”  I did not think  Mr. Cayenne, however, very well qualified for peacemaker, but,  nevertheless, I consented to go; and having thus got an inkling of the  cause of that cold back-turning which had distressed me so much, I made  such an effort to remove the error that was entertained against me, that  some of the heritors, before we separated, shook me by the hands with the  cordiality of renewed friendship; and, as if to make amends for past  neglect, there was no end to their invitations to dinner which had the  effect of putting me again on my mettle, and removing the thick and muddy  melancholious humour out of my blood.    But what confirmed my cure was the coming home of my daughter Janet from  the Ayr boarding-school, where she had learnt to play on the spinnet, and  was become a conversible lassie, with a competent knowledge, for a woman  of geography and history; so that when her mother was busy with the  weariful booming wheel, she entertained me sometimes with a tune, and  sometimes with her tongue, which made the winter nights fly cantily by.    Whether it was owing to the malady of my imagination throughout the  greatest part of this year, or that really nothing particular did happen  to interest me, I cannot say; but it is very remarkable that I have  nothing remarkable to record—further, than I was at the expense myself of  getting the manse rough-case, and the window cheeks painted, with roans  put up, rather than apply to the heritors; for they were always sorely  fashed when called upon for outlay.          CHAPTER XXXIV  YEAR 1793      ON the first night of this year I dreamt a very remarkable dream, which,  when I now recall to mind at this distance of time, I cannot but think  that there was a case of prophecy in it.  I thought that I stood on the  tower of an old popish kirk, looking out at the window upon the kirkyard,  where I beheld ancient tombs, with effigies and coats-of-arms on the wall  thereof, and a great gate at the one side, and a door that led into a  dark and dismal vault at the other.  I thought all the dead that were  lying in the common graves, rose out of their coffins; at the same time,  from the old and grand monuments, with the effigies and coats-of-arms,  came the great men, and the kings of the earth with crowns on their  heads, and globes and sceptres in their hands.    I stood wondering what was to ensue, when presently I heard the noise of  drums and trumpets, and anon I beheld an army with banners entering in at  the gate; upon which the kings and the great men came also forth in their  power and array, and a dreadful battle was foughten; but the multitude  that had risen from the common graves, stood afar off, and were but  lookers-on.    The kings and their host were utterly discomfited.  They were driven  within the doors of their monuments, their coats-of-arms were broken off,  and their effigies cast down, and the victors triumphed over them with  the flourishes of trumpets and the waving of banners.  But while I  looked, the vision was changed, and I then beheld a wide and a dreary  waste, and afar off the steeples of a great city, and a tower in the  midst, like the tower of Babel, and on it I could discern, written in  characters of fire, “Public Opinion.”  While I was pondering at the same,  I heard a great shout, and presently the conquerors made their  appearance, coming over the desolate moor.  They were going in great  pride and might towards the city; but an awful burning rose, afar as it  were in the darkness, and the flames stood like a tower of fire that  reached unto the heavens.  And I saw a dreadful hand and an arm stretched  from out of the cloud, and in its hold was a besom made of the hail and  the storm, and it swept the fugitives like dust; and in their place I saw  the churchyard, as it were, cleared and spread around, the graves closed,  and the ancient tombs, with their coats-of-arms and their effigies of  stone, all as they were in the beginning.  I then awoke, and behold it  was a dream.    This vision perplexed me for many days, and when the news came that the  King of France was beheaded by the hands of his people, I received, as it  were, a token in confirmation of the vision that had been disclosed to me  in my sleep, and I preached a discourse on the same, and against the  French Revolution, that was thought one of the greatest and soundest  sermons that I had ever delivered in my pulpit.    On the Monday following, Mr. Cayenne, who had been some time before  appointed a justice of the peace, came over from Wheatrig House to the  Cross-Keys, where he sent for me and divers other respectable inhabitants  of the clachan, and told us that he was to have a sad business, for a  warrant was out to bring before him two democratical weaver lads, on a  suspicion of high treason.  Scarcely were the words uttered when they  were brought in, and he began to ask them how they dared to think of  dividing, with their liberty and equality of principles, his and every  other man’s property in the country.  The men answered him in a calm  manner, and told him they sought no man’s property, but only their own  natural rights; upon which he called them traitors and reformers.  They  denied they were traitors, but confessed they were reformers, and said  they knew not how that should be imputed to them as a fault, for that the  greatest men of all times had been reformers,—“Was not,” they said, “our  Lord Jesus Christ a reformer?”—“And what the devil did he make of it?”  cried Mr. Cayenne, bursting with passion; “Was he not crucified?”    I thought, when I heard these words, that the pillars of the earth sank  beneath me, and that the roof of the house was carried away in a  whirlwind.  The drums of my ears crackit, blue starns danced before my  sight, and I was fain to leave the house and hie me home to the manse,  where I sat down in my study, like a stupified creature, awaiting what  would betide.  Nothing, however, was found against the weaver lads; but I  never from that day could look on Mr. Cayenne as a Christian, though  surely he was a true government-man.    Soon after this affair, there was a pleasant re-edification of a  gospel-spirit among the heritors, especially when they heard how I had  handled the regicides in France; and on the following Sunday, I had the  comfortable satisfaction to see many a gentleman in their pews, that had  not been for years within a kirk-door.  The democrats, who took a world  of trouble to misrepresent the actions of the gentry, insinuated that all  this was not from any new sense of grace, but in fear of their being  reported as suspected persons to the king’s government.  But I could not  think so, and considered their renewal of communion with the church as a  swearing of allegiance to the King of kings, against that host of French  atheists, who had torn the mortcloth from the coffin, and made it a  banner, with which they were gone forth to war against the Lamb.  The  whole year was, however, spent in great uneasiness, and the proclamation  of the war was followed by an appalling stop in trade.  We heard of  nothing but failures on all hands; and among others that grieved me, was  that of Mr. Maitland of Glasgow, who had befriended Mrs. Malcolm in the  days of her affliction, and gave her son Robert his fine ship.  It was a  sore thing to hear of so many breakings, especially of old respected  merchants like him, who had been a Lord Provost, and was far declined  into the afternoon of life.  He did not, however, long survive the  mutation of his fortune; but bending his aged head in sorrow, sank down  beneath the stroke, to rise no more.                        [Picture: The Minister’s Daughter]          CHAPTER XXXV  YEAR 1794      THIS year had opened into all the leafiness of midsummer before anything  memorable happened in the parish, further than that the sad division of  my people into government-men and jacobins was perfected.  This calamity,  for I never could consider such heartburning among neighbours as any  thing less than a very heavy calamity, was assuredly occasioned by faults  on both sides; but it must be confessed that the gentry did nothing to  win the commonality from the errors of their way.  A little more  condescension on their part would not have made things worse, and might  have made them better; but pride interposed, and caused them to think  that any show of affability from them would be construed by the democrats  into a terror of their power; while the democrats were no less to blame;  for hearing how their compeers were thriving in France, and demolishing  every obstacle to their ascendency, they were crouse and really insolent,  evidencing none of that temperance in prosperity that proves the  possessors worthy of their good fortune.    As for me, my duty in these circumstances was plain and simple.  The  Christian religion was attempted to be brought into disrepute; the rising  generation were taught to gibe at its holiest ordinances; and the kirk  was more frequented as a place to while away the time on a rainy Sunday,  than for any insight of the admonitions and revelations in the sacred  book.  Knowing this, I perceived that it would be of no effect to handle  much the mysteries of the faith; but as there was at the time a bruit and  a sound about universal benevolence, philanthropy, utility, and all the  other disguises with which an infidel philosophy appropriated to itself  the charity, brotherly love, and welldoing inculcated by our holy  religion, I set myself to task upon these heads, and thought it no  robbery to use a little of the stratagem employed against Christ’s  kingdom, to promote the interests thereof in the hearts and  understandings of those whose ears would have been sealed against me, had  I attempted to expound higher things.  Accordingly, on one day it was my  practice to show what the nature of Christian charity was, comparing it  to the light and warmth of the sun, that shines impartially on the just  and the unjust—showing that man, without the sense of it as a duty, was  as the beasts that perish, and that every feeling of his nature was  intimately selfish, but then when actuated by this divine impulse, he  rose out of himself, and became as a god, zealous to abate the sufferings  of all things that live; and, on the next day, I demonstrated that the  new benevolence which had come so much into vogue, was but another  version of this Christian virtue.  In like manner, I dealt with brotherly  love, bringing it home to the business and bosoms of my hearers, that the  Christianity of it was neither enlarged nor bettered by being baptized  with the Greek name of philanthropy.  With welldoing, however, I went  more roundly to work, I told my people that I thought they had more sense  than to secede from Christianity to become Utilitarians; for that it  would be a confession of ignorance of the faith they deserved, seeing  that it was the main duty inculcated by our religion to do all in morals  and manners to which the newfangled doctrine of utility pretended.    These discourses, which I continued for sometime, had no great effect on  the men; but being prepared in a familiar household manner, they took the  fancies of the young women, which was to me an assurance that the seed I  had planted would in time shoot forth; for I reasoned with myself, that  if the gudeman of the immediate generation should continue free-thinkers,  their wives will take care that those of the next shall not lack that  spunk of grace; so I was cheered under that obscurity which fell upon  Christianity at this time, with a vista beyond, in which I saw, as it  were, the children unborn, walking on the bright green, and in the  unclouded splendour of the faith.    But what with the decay of trade, and the temptation of the king’s  bounty, and, over all, the witlessness that was in the spirit of man at  this time, the number that enlisted in the course for the year from the  parish was prodigious.  In one week no less than three weavers and two  cotton-spinners went over to Ayr, and took the bounty of the Royal  Artillery.  But I could not help remarking to myself, that the people  were grown so used to changes and extraordinary adventures, that the  single enlistment of Thomas Wilson, at the beginning of the American war,  occasioned a far greater grief and work among us, than all the swarms  that went off week after week in the months of November and December of  this year.          CHAPTER XXXVI  YEAR 1795      THE present Ann. Dom. was ushered in with an event that I had never  dreaded to see in my day, in our once sober and religious country parish.  The number of lads that had gone over to Ayr to be soldiers from among  the spinners and weavers of Cayenneville had been so great, that the  government got note of it, and sent a recruiting party to be quartered in  the town; for the term clachan was beginning by this time to wear out of  fashion: indeed, the place itself was outgrowing the fitness of that  title.  Never shall I forget the dunt that the first tap of the drum gied  to my heart, as I was sitting on Hansel Monday by myself at the parlour  fireside, Mrs. Balwhidder being throng with the lassies looking out a  washing, and my daughter at Ayr, spending a few days with her old  comrades of the boarding school.  I thought it was the enemy; and then  anon the sound of the fife came shrill to the ear, for the night was lown  and peaceful.  My wife and all the lassies came flying in upon me, crying  all in the name of heaven, what could it be? by which I was obligated to  put on my big-coat, and, with my hat and staff, go out to enquire.  The  whole town was aloof, the aged at the doors in clusters, and the bairns  following the tattoo, as it was called, and at every doubling beat of the  drum, shouting as if they had been in the face of their foemen.    Mr. Archibald Dozendale, one of my elders, was saying to several persons  around him, just as I came up, “Hech, sirs! but the battle draws near our  gates,” upon which there was a heavy sigh from all that heard him; and  then they told me of the sergeant’s business; and we had a serious  communing together anent the same.  But while we were thus standing  discoursing on the causey, Mrs. Balwhidder and the servant lassies could  thole no longer, but in a troop came in quest of me, to hear what was  doing.  In short, it was a night both of sorrow and anxiety.  Mr.  Dozendale walked back to the manse with us, and we had a sober tumbler of  toddy together; marvelling exceedingly where these fearful portents and  changes would stop, both of us being of opinion that the end of the world  was drawing nearer and nearer.    Whether it was, however, that the lads belonging to the place did not  like to show themselves with the enlistment cockades among their  acquaintance, or that there was any other reason, I cannot take it upon  me to say; but certain it is, the recruiting party came no speed, and, in  consequence, were removed about the end of March.    Another thing happened in this year, too remarkable for me to neglect to  put on record, as it strangely and strikingly marked the rapid  revolutions that were going on.  In the month of August at the time of  the fair, a gang of playactors came, and hired Thomas Thacklan’s barn for  their enactments.  They were the first of that clanjamfrey who had ever  been in the parish; and there was a wonderful excitement caused by the  rumours concerning them.  Their first performance was _Douglas Tragedy_  and the _Gentle Shepherd_: and the general opinion was, that the lad who  played Norval in the play, and Patie in the farce, was an English lord’s  son, who had run away from his parents rather than marry an old cracket  lady with a great portion.  But, whatever truth there might be in this  notion, certain it is, the whole pack was in a state of perfect beggary;  and yet, for all that, they not only in their parts, as I was told,  laughed most heartily, but made others do the same; for I was constrained  to let my daughter go to see them, with some of her acquaintance; and she  gave me such an account of what they did, that I thought I would have  liked to have gotten a keek at them myself.  At the same time, I must own  this was a sinful curiosity, and I stifled it to the best of my ability.  Among other plays that they did, was one called _Macbeth and the  Witches_, which the Miss Cayennes had seen performed in London, when they  were there in the winter time with their father, for three months, seeing  the world, after coming from the boarding-school.  But it was no more  like the true play of Shakespeare the poet, according to their account,  than a duddy betheral, set up to fright the sparrows from the peas, is  like a living gentleman.  The hungry players, instead of behaving like  guests at the royal banquet, were voracious on the needful feast of  bread, and the strong ale, that served for wine in decanters.  But the  greatest sport of all was about a kail-pot, that acted the part of a  caldron, and which should have sunk with thunder and lightning into the  earth; however, it did quite as well, for it made its exit, as Miss  Virginia said, by walking quietly off, being pulled by a string fastened  to one of its feet.  No scene of the play was so much applauded as this  one; and the actor who did the part of King Macbeth made a most polite  bow of thankfulness to the audience, for the approbation with which they  had received the performance of the pot.    We had likewise, shortly after the “Omnes exeunt” of the players, an  exhibition of a different sort in the same barn.  This was by two English  quakers, and a quaker lady, tanners of Kendal, who had been at Ayr on  some leather business, where they preached, but made no proselytes.  The  travellers were all three in a whisky, drawn by one of the best-ordered  horses, as the hostler at the Cross-Keys told me, ever seen.  They came  to the Inn to their dinner, and meaning to stay all night, sent round, to  let it be known that they would hold a meeting in Friend Thacklan’s barn;  but Thomas denied they were either kith or kin to him: this, however, was  their way of speaking.    In the evening, owing to the notice, a great congregation was assembled  in the barn, and I myself, along with Mr. Archibald Dozendale, went there  likewise, to keep the people in awe; for we feared the strangers might be  jeered and insulted.  The three were seated aloft on a high stage,  prepared on purpose, with two mares and scaffold-deals, borrowed from Mr.  Trowel the mason.  They sat long, and silent; but at last the spirit  moved the woman, and she rose, and delivered a very sensible exposition  of Christianity.  I was really surprised to hear such sound doctrine; and  Mr. Dozendale said, justly, that it was more to the purpose than some  that my younger brethren from Edinburgh endeavoured to teach.  So, that  those who went to laugh at the sincere simplicity of the pious quakers,  were rebuked by a very edifying discourse on the moral duties of a  Christian’s life.    Upon the whole, however, this, to the best of my recollection, was  another unsatisfactory year.  In this we were, doubtless, brought more  into the world; but we had a greater variety of temptation set before us,  and there was still jealousy and estrangement in the dispositions of the  gentry, and the lower orders, particularly the manufacturers.  I cannot  say, indeed, that there was any increase of corruption among the rural  portion of my people; for their vocation calling them to work apart, in  the purity of the free air of heaven, they were kept uncontaminated by  that seditious infection which fevered the minds of the sedentary  weavers, and working like flatulence in the stomachs of the  cotton-spinners, sent up into their heads a vain and diseased fume of  infidel philosophy.          CHAPTER XXXVII  YEAR 1796      THE prosperity of fortune is like the blossoms of spring, or the golden  hue of the evening cloud.  It delighteth the spirit, and passeth away.    In the month of February my second wife was gathered to the Lord.  She  had been very ill for some time with an income in her side, which no  medicine could remove.  I had the best doctors in the country side to  her; but their skill was of no avail, their opinions being that her ail  was caused by an internal abscess, for which physic has provided no cure.  Her death was to me a great sorrow; for she was a most excellent wife,  industrious to a degree, and managed every thing with so brisk a hand,  that nothing went wrong that she put it to.  With her I had grown richer  than any other minister in the presbytery; but, above all, she was the  mother of my bairns, which gave her a double claim upon me.    I laid her by the side of my first love, Betty Lanshaw, my own cousin  that was, and I inscribed her name upon the same headstone; but time had  drained my poetical vein, and I have not yet been able to indite an  epitaph on her merits and virtues, for she had an eminent share of both.  Her greatest fault—the best have their faults—was an over-earnestness to  gather gear; in the doing of which I thought she sometimes sacrificed the  comforts of a pleasant fireside; for she was never in her element but  when she was keeping the servants eident at their work.  But, if by this  she subtracted something from the quietude that was most consonant to my  nature, she has left cause, both in bank and bond, for me and her bairns  to bless her great household activity.    She was not long deposited in her place of rest till I had occasion to  find her loss.  All my things were kept by her in a most perjink and  excellent order; but they soon fell into an amazing confusion; for, as  she often said to me, I had a turn for heedlessness; insomuch, that  although my daughter Janet was grown up, and able to keep the house, I  saw that it would be necessary, as soon as decency would allow, for me to  take another wife.  I was moved to this chiefly by foreseeing that my  daughter would in time be married, and taken away from me, but more on  account of the servant lasses, who grew out of all bounds, verifying the  proverb, “Well kens the mouse when the cat’s out of the house.”  Besides  this, I was now far down in the vale of years, and could not expect to be  long without feeling some of the penalties of old age, although I was  still a hail and sound man.  It therefore behoved me to look in time for  a helpmate, to tend me in my approaching infirmities.    Upon this important concern I reflected, as I may say, in the watches of  the night; and, considering the circumstances of my situation, I saw it  would not do for me to look out for an overly young woman, nor yet would  it do for one of my ways to take an elderly maiden, ladies of that sort  being liable to possess strong-set particularities.  I therefore resolved  that my choice should lie among widows of a discreet age; and I had a  glimmer in my mind of speaking to Mrs. Malcolm; but when I reflected on  the saintly steadiness of her character, I was satisfied it would be of  no use to think of her.  Accordingly, I bent my brows, and looked towards  Irville, which is an abundant trone for widows and other single women;  and I fixed my purpose on Mrs. Nugent, the relic of a professor in the  university of Glasgow, both because she was a well-bred woman, without  any children to plea about the interest of my own two, and likewise  because she was held in great estimation by all who knew her, as a lady  of a Christian principle.    It was some time in the summer, however, before I made up my mind to  speak to her on the subject; but one afternoon, in the month of August, I  resolved to do so, and with that intent walked leisurely over to Irville;  and after calling on the Rev. Dr. Dinwiddie, the minister, I stepped in,  as if by chance, to Mrs. Nugent’s.  I could see that she was a little  surprised at my visit; however, she treated me with every possible  civility, and her servant lass bringing in the tea-things in a most  orderly manner, as punctually as the clock was striking, she invited me  to sit still, and drink my tea with her; which I did, being none  displeased to get such encouragement.  However, I said nothing that time,  but returned to the manse, very well content with what I had observed,  which made me fain to repeat my visit.  So, in the course of the week,  taking Janet my daughter with me, we walked over in the forenoon, and  called at Mrs. Nugent’s first, before going to any other house; and Janet  saying, as we came out to go to the minister’s, that she thought Mrs.  Nugent an agreeable woman, I determined to knock the nail on the head  without further delay.    Accordingly, I invited the minister and his wife to dine with us on the  Thursday following; and before leaving the town, I made Janet, while the  minister and me were handling a subject, as a sort of thing in common  civility, go to Mrs. Nugent, and invite her also.  Dr. Dinwiddie was a  gleg man, of a jocose nature; and he, guessing something of what I was  ettling at, was very mirthful with me; but I kept my own counsel till a  meet season.    On the Thursday, the company as invited came, and nothing extraordinary  was seen; but in cutting up and helping a hen, Dr. Dinwiddie put one wing  on Mrs. Nugent’s plate, and the other wing on my plate, and said, there  have been greater miracles than these two wings flying together, which  was a sharp joke, that caused no little merriment at the expense of Mrs.  Nugent and me.  I, however, to show that I was none daunted, laid a leg  also on her plate, and took another on my own, saying, in the words of  the reverend doctor, there have been greater miracles than that these two  legs should lie in the same nest, which was thought a very clever come  off; and, at the same time, I gave Mrs. Nugent a kindly nip on her sonsy  arm, which was breaking the ice in as pleasant a way as could be.  In  short, before anything passed between ourselves on the subject, we were  set down for a trysted pair; and this being the case, we were married as  soon as a twelvemonth and a day had passed from the death of the second  Mrs. Balwhidder; and neither of us have had occasion to rue the bargain.  It is, however, but a piece of justice due to my second wife to say, that  this was not a little owing to her good management; for she had left such  a well-plenished house, that her successor said, we had nothing to do but  to contribute to one another’s happiness.    In this year nothing more memorable happened in the parish, saving that  the cotton-mill dam burst about the time of the Lammas flood, and the  waters went forth like a deluge of destruction, carrying off much  victual, and causing a vast of damage to the mills that are lower down  the stream.  It was just a prodigy to see how calmly Mr. Cayenne acted on  that occasion; for, being at other times as crabbed as a wud terrier,  folk were afraid to tell him, till he came out himself in the morning and  saw the devastation; at the sight of which he gave only a shrill whistle,  and began to laugh at the idea of the men fearing to take him the news,  as if he had not fortune and philosophy enough, as he called it, to  withstand much greater misfortunes.                              [Picture: The Weaver]          CHAPTER XXXVIII  YEAR 1797      WHEN I have seen in my walks the irrational creatures of God, the birds  and the beasts, governed by a kindly instinct in attendance on their  young, often has it come into my head that love and charity, far more  than reason or justice, formed the tie that holds the world, with all its  jarring wants and woes, in social dependence and obligation together;  and, in this year, a strong verification of the soundness of this notion  was exemplified in the conduct of the poor haverel lassie Meg Gaffaw,  whose naturality on the occasion of her mother’s death I have related at  length in this chronicle.    In the course of the summer, Mr. Henry Melcomb, who was a nephew to Mr.  Cayenne, came down from England to see his uncle.  He had just completed  his education at the college of Christ Church, in Oxford, and was the  most perfect young gentleman that had ever been seen in this part of the  country.    In his appearance he was a very paragon, with a fine manly countenance,  frank-hearted, blithe, and, in many points of character, very like my old  friend the Lord Eaglesham, who was shot.  Indeed, in some respects, he  was even above his lordship; for he had a great turn at ready wit, and  could joke and banter in a most agreeable manner.  He came very often to  the manse to see me, and took great pleasure in my company, and really  used a freedom that was so droll, I could scarcely keep my composity and  decorum with him.  Among others that shared in his attention, was daft  Meg Gaffaw, whom he had forgathered with one day in coming to see me; and  after conversing with her for some time, he handed her, as she told me  herself, over the kirk-stile like a lady of high degree, and came with  her to the manse door linking by the arm.    From the ill-timed daffin of that hour, poor Meg fell deep in love with  Mr. Melcomb; and it was just a playacting to see the arts and antics she  put in practice to win his attention.  In her garb, she had never any  sense of a proper propriety, but went about the country asking for  shapings of silks and satins, with which she patched her duds, calling  them by the divers names of robes and negligées.  All hitherto, however,  had been moderation, compared to the daffadile of vanity which she was  now seen, when she had searched, as she said, to the bottom of her  coffer.  I cannot take it upon me to describe her; but she kythed in such  a variety of cuffs and ruffles, feathers, old gumflowers, painted paper  knots, ribbons, and furs, and laces, and went about gecking and simpering  with an old fan in her hand, that it was not in the power of nature to  look at her with sobriety.    Her first appearance in this masquerading was at the kirk on the Sunday  following her adventure with Mr. Melcomb, and it was with a sore  difficulty that I could keep my eyes off her, even in prayer; and when  the kirk skailed, she walked before him, spreading all her grandeur to  catch his eye, in such a manner as had not been seen or heard of since  the prank that Lady Macadam played Miss Betty Wudrife.    Any other but Mr. Melcomb would have been provoked by the fool’s folly;  but he humoured her wit, and, to the amazement of the whole people,  presented her his hand, and allemanded her along in a manner that should  not have been seen in any street out of a king’s court, and far less on  the Lord’s day.  But, alas! this sport did not last long.  Mr. Melcomb  had come from England to be ‘married’ to his cousin, Miss Virginia  Cayenne, and poor daft Meg never heard of it till the banns for their  purpose of marriage was read out by Mr. Lorimore on the Sabbath after.  The words were scarcely out of his mouth, when the simple and innocent  natural gave a loud shriek, that terrified the whole congregation, and  ran out of the kirk demented.  There was no more finery for poor Meg; but  she went and sat opposite to the windows of Mr. Cayenne’s house, where  Mr. Melcomb was, with clasped hands and beseeching eyes, like a  monumental statue in alabaster, and no entreaty could drive her away.  Mr. Melcomb sent her money, and the bride many a fine thing; but Meg  flung them from her, and clasped her hands again, and still sat.  Mr.  Cayenne would have let loose the house-dog on her, but was not permitted.    In the evening it began to rain, and they thought that and the coming  darkness would drive her away; but when the servants looked out before  barring the doors, there she was in the same posture.  I was to perform  the marriage ceremony at seven o’clock in the morning, for the young pair  were to go that night to Edinburgh; and when I went, there was Meg  sitting looking at the windows with her hands clasped.  When she saw me  she gave a shrill cry, and took me by the hand, and wised me to go back,  crying out in a heart-breaking voice, “O, Sir!  No yet—no yet!  He’ll  maybe draw back, and think of a far truer bride.”  I was wae for her and  very angry with the servants for laughing at the fond folly of the  ill-less thing.    When the marriage was over, and the carriage at the door, the bridegroom  handed in the bride.  Poor Meg saw this, and jumping up from where she  sat, was at his side like a spirit, as he was stepping in, and, taking  him by the hand, she looked in his face so piteously, that every heart  was sorrowful, for she could say nothing.  When he pulled away his hand,  and the door was shut, she stood as if she had been charmed to the spot,  and saw the chaise drive away.  All that were about the door then spoke  to her, but she heard us not.  At last she gave a deep sigh, and the  water coming into her eye, she said, “The worm—the worm is my bonny  bridegroom, and Jenny with the many-feet my bridal maid.  The mill-dam  water’s the wine o’ the wedding, and the clay and the clod shall be my  bedding.  A lang night is meet for a bridal, but none shall be langer  than mine.”  In saying which words, she fled from among us, with heels  like the wind.  The servants pursued; but long before they could stop  her, she was past redemption in the deepest plumb of the cotton-mill dam.    Few deaths had for many a day happened in the parish, to cause so much  sorrow as that of this poor silly creature.  She was a sort of household  familiar among us, and there was much like the inner side of wisdom in  the pattern of her sayings, many of which are still preserved as  proverbs.          CHAPTER XXXIX  YEAR 1798      THIS was one of the heaviest years in the whole course of my ministry.  The spring was slow of coming, and cold and wet when it did come; the  dibs were full, the roads foul, and the ground that should have been dry  at the seed-time, was as claggy as clay, and clung to the harrow.  The  labour of man and beast was thereby augmented; and all nature being in a  state of sluggish indisposition, it was evident to every eye of  experience that there would be a great disappointment to the hopes of the  husbandman.    Foreseeing this, I gathered the opinion of all the most sagacious of my  parishioners, and consulted with them for a provision against the evil  day, and we spoke to Mr. Cayenne on the subject, for he had a talent by  common in matters of mercantile management.  It was amazing, considering  his hot temper, with what patience he heard the grounds of our  apprehension, and how he questioned and sifted the experience of the old  farmers, till he was thoroughly convinced that all similar seed-times  were ever followed by a short crop.  He then said, that he would prove  himself a better friend to the parish than he was thought.  Accordingly,  as he afterwards told me himself, he wrote off that very night to his  correspondents in America, to buy for his account all the wheat and flour  they could get, and ship it to arrive early in the fall; and he bought up  likewise in countries round the Baltic great store of victual, and  brought in two cargoes to Irville on purpose for the parish, against the  time of need, making for the occasion a garnel of one of the warehouses  of the cotton-mill.    The event came to pass as had been foretold: the harvest fell short, and  Mr. Cayenne’s cargoes from America and the Baltic came home in due  season, by which he made a terrible power of money, clearing thousands on  thousands by post after post—making more profit, as he said himself, in  the course of one month, he believed, than ever was made by any  individual within the kingdom of Scotland in the course of a year.—He  said, however that he might have made more if he had bought up the corn  at home; but being convinced by us that there would be a scarcity, he  thought it his duty as an honest man to draw from the stores and  granaries of foreign countries, by which he was sure he would serve his  country, and be abundantly rewarded.  In short, we all reckoned him  another Joseph when he opened his garnels at the cotton-mill, and, after  distributing a liberal portion to the poor and needy, selling the  remainder at an easy rate to the generality of the people.  Some of the  neighbouring parishes, however, were angry that he would not serve them  likewise, and called him a wicked and extortionate forestaller; but he  made it plain to the meanest capacity, that if he did not circumscribe  his dispensation to our own bounds it would be as nothing.  So that,  although he brought a wonderful prosperity in by the cotton-mill, and a  plenteous supply of corn in a time of famine, doing more in these things  for the people than all the other heritors had done from the beginning of  time, he was much reviled; even his bounty was little esteemed by my  people, because he took a moderate profit on what he sold to them.  Perhaps, however, these prejudices might be partly owing to their dislike  of his hasty temper, at least I am willing to think so; for it would  grieve me if they were really ungrateful for a benefit that made the  pressure of the time lie but lightly on them.    The alarm of the Irish rebellion in this year was likewise another source  of affliction to us; for many of the gentry coming over in great straits,  especially ladies and their children, and some of them in the hurry of  their flight having but little ready money, were very ill off.  Some four  or five families came to the Cross-Keys in this situation, and the  conduct of Mr. Cayenne to them was most exemplary.  He remembered his own  haste with his family from Virginia, when the Americans rebelled; and  immediately on hearing of these Irish refugees, he waited on them with  his wife and daughter, supplied them with money, invited them to his  house, made ploys to keep up their spirits, while the other gentry stood  back till they knew something of the strangers.    Among these destitute ladies was a Mrs. Desmond and her two daughters, a  woman of most august presence, being indeed more like one ordained to  reign over a kingdom, than for household purposes.  The Miss Desmonds  were only entering their teens, but they also had no ordinary stamp upon  them.  What made this party the more particular, was on account of Mr.  Desmond, who was supposed to be a united man with the rebels, and it was  known his son was deep in their plots; yet although this was all told to  Mr. Cayenne, by some of the other Irish ladies who were of the loyal  connexion, it made no difference with him, but, on the contrary, he acted  as if he thought the Desmonds the most of all the refugees entitled to  his hospitable civilities.  This was a wonderment to our strait-laced  narrow lairds, as there was not a man of such strict government  principles in the whole country side as Mr. Cayenne: but he said he  carried his political principles only to the camp and the council.  “To  the hospital and the prison,” said he, “I take those of a man”—which was  almost a Christian doctrine, and from that declaration Mr. Cayenne and me  began again to draw a little more cordially together; although he had  still a very imperfect sense of religion, which I attributed to his being  born in America, where even as yet, I am told, they have but a scanty  sprinkling of grace.    But before concluding this year, I should tell the upshot of the  visitation of the Irish, although it did not take place until some time  after the peace with France.    In the putting down of the rebels Mr. Desmond and his son made their  escape to Paris, where they stayed till the treaty was signed, by which,  for several years after the return to Ireland of the grand lady and her  daughters, as Mrs. Desmond was called by our commonalty, we heard nothing  of them.  The other refugees repaid Mr. Cayenne his money with  thankfulness, and, on their restoration to their homes, could not  sufficiently express their sense of his kindness.  But the silence and  seeming ingratitude of the Desmonds vexed him; and he could not abide to  hear the Irish rebellion mentioned without flying into a passion against  the rebels, which every body knew was owing to the ill return he had  received from that family.  However, one afternoon, just about half an  hour before his wonted dinner hour, a grand equipage, with four horses  and outriders, stopped at his door, and who was in it but Mrs. Desmond  and an elderly man, and a young gentleman with an aspect like a lord.  It  was her husband and son.  They had come from Ireland in all their state  on purpose to repay with interest the money Mr. Cayenne had counted so  long lost, and to express in person the perpetual obligation which he had  conferred upon the Desmond family, in all time coming.  The lady then  told him, that she had been so straitened in helping the poor ladies,  that it was not in her power to make repayment till Desmond, as she  called her husband, came home; and not choosing to assign the true  reason, lest it might cause trouble, she rather submitted to be suspected  of ingratitude than to an improper thing.    Mr. Cayenne was transported with this unexpected return, and a friendship  grew up between the families, which was afterwards cemented into  relationship by the marriage of the young Desmond with Miss Caroline  Cayenne.  Some in the parish objected to this match, Mrs. Desmond being a  papist: but as Miss Caroline had received an episcopalian education, I  thought it of no consequence, and married them after their family  chaplain from Ireland, as a young couple both by beauty and fortune well  matched, and deserving of all conjugal felicity.          CHAPTER XL  YEAR 1799      THERE are but two things to make me remember this year; the first was the  marriage of my daughter Janet with the reverend Dr. Kittlewood of  Swappington, a match in every way commendable; and on the advice of the  third Mrs. Balwhidder, I settled a thousand pounds down, and promised  five hundred more at my death if I died before my spouse, and a thousand  at her death if she survived me; which was the greatest portion ever  minister’s daughter had in our country side.  In this year likewise I  advanced fifteen hundred pounds for my son in a concern in Glasgow,—all  was the gathering of that indefatigable engine of industry the second  Mrs. Balwhidder, whose talents her successor said were a wonder, when she  considered the circumstances in which I had been left at her death, and  made out of a narrow stipend.    The other memorable was the death of Mrs. Malcolm.  If ever there was a  saint on this earth, she was surely one.  She had been for some time  bedfast, having all her days from the date of her widowhood been a tender  woman; but no change made any alteration on the Christian contentment of  her mind.  She bore adversity with an honest pride; she toiled in the day  of penury and affliction with thankfulness for her earnings, although  ever so little.  She bent her head to the Lord in resignation when her  first-born fell in battle; nor was she puffed up with vanity when her  daughters were married, as it was said, so far above their degree, though  they showed it was but into their proper sphere by their demeanour after.  She lived to see her second son, the captain, rise into affluence,  married, and with a thriving young family; and she had the very great  satisfaction, on the last day she was able to go to church, to see her  youngest son the clergyman standing in my pulpit, a doctor of divinity,  and the placed minister of a richer parish than mine.  Well indeed might  she have said on that day, “Lord, let thy servant depart in peace, for  mine eyes have seen thy salvation.”    For some time it had been manifest to all who saw her, that her latter  end was drawing nigh; and therefore, as I had kept up a correspondence  with her daughters, Mrs. Macadam and Mrs. Howard, I wrote them a  particular account of her case, which brought them to the clachan.  They  both came in their own carriages; for Colonel Macadam was now a general,  and had succeeded to a great property by an English uncle, his mother’s  brother; and Captain Howard, by the death of his father, was also a man,  as it was said, with a lord’s living.  Robert Malcolm, her son the  captain, was in the West Indies at the time; but his wife came on the  first summons, as did William the minister.    They all arrived about four o’clock in the afternoon, and at seven a  message came for me and Mrs. Balwhidder to go over to them, which we did,  and found the strangers seated by the heavenly patient’s bedside.  On my  entering, she turned her eyes towards me, and said, “Bear witness, sir,  that I die thankful for an extraordinary portion of temporal mercies.  The heart of my youth was withered like the leaf that is scared with the  lightning; but in my children I have received a great indemnification for  the sorrows of that trial.”  She then requested me to pray, saying, “No;  let it be a thanksgiving.  My term is out, and I have nothing more to  hope or fear from the good or evil of this world.  But I have had much to  make me grateful; therefore, sir, return thanks for the time I have been  spared, for the goodness granted so long unto me, and the gentle hand  with which the way from this world is smoothed for my passing.”    There was something so sweet and consolatory in the way she said this,  that although it moved all present to tears, they were tears without the  wonted bitterness of grief.  Accordingly, I knelt down and did as she had  required, and there was a great stillness while I prayed.  At the  conclusion we looked to the bed, but the spirit had, in the mean time,  departed, and there was nothing remaining but the clay tenement.    It was expected by the parish, considering the vast affluence of the  daughters, that there would have been a grand funeral, and Mrs. Howard  thought it was necessary; but her sister, who had from her youth upward a  superior discernment of propriety, said, “No, as my mother has lived, so  shall be her end.”  Accordingly, everybody of any respect in the clachan  was invited to the funeral; but none of the gentry, saving only such as  had been numbered among the acquaintance of the deceased.  But Mr.  Cayenne came unbidden, saying to me, that although he did not know Mrs.  Malcolm personally, he had often heard she was an amiable woman, and  therefore he thought it a proper compliment to her family, who were out  of the parish, to show in what respect she was held among us; for he was  a man that would take his own way, and do what he thought was right,  heedless alike of blame or approbation.    If, however, the funeral was plain, though respectable, the ladies  distributed a liberal sum among the poor families; but before they went  away, a silent token of their mother’s virtue came to light, which was at  once a source of sorrow and pleasure.  Mrs. Malcolm was first well  provided by the Macadams, afterwards the Howards settled on her an equal  annuity, by which she spent her latter days in great comfort.  Many a  year before, she had repaid Provost Maitland the money he sent her in the  day of her utmost distress; and at this period he was long dead, having  died of a broken heart at the time of his failure.  From that time his  widow and her daughters had been in very straitened circumstances; but  unknown to all but herself, and HIM from whom nothing is hid, Mrs.  Malcolm from time to time had sent them, in a blank letter, an occasional  note to the young ladies to buy a gown.  After her death, a bank-bill for  a sum of money, her own savings, was found in her scrutoire, with a note  of her own writing pinned to the same, stating, that the amount being  more than she had needed for herself, belonged of right to those who had  so generously provided for her; but as they were not in want of such a  trifle, it would be a token of respect to her memory, if they would give  the bill to Mrs. Maitland and her daughters, which was done with the most  glad alacrity; and, in the doing of it, the private kindness was brought  to light.                            [Picture: The Millwright]    Thus ended the history of Mrs. Malcolm, as connected with our Parish  Annals.  Her house was sold, and is the same now inhabited by the  millwright, Mr. Periffery; and a neat house it still is, for the  possessor is an Englishman, and the English have an uncommon taste for  snod houses and trim gardens; but at the time it was built, there was not  a better in the town, though it’s now but of the second class.  Yearly we  hear both from Mrs. Macadam and her sister, with a five-pound note from  each to the poor of the parish, as a token of their remembrance; but they  are far off, and, were any thing ailing me, I suppose the gift will not  be continued.  As for Captain Malcolm, he has proved, in many ways, a  friend to such of our young men as have gone to sea.  He has now left it  off himself, and settled at London, where he latterly sailed from, and, I  understand, is in a great way as a shipowner.  These things I have  thought it fitting to record, and will now resume my historical  narration.          CHAPTER XLI  YEAR 1800      THE same quietude and regularity that marked the progress of the last  year, continued throughout the whole of this.  We sowed and reaped in  tranquillity, though the sough of distant war came heavily from a  distance.  The cotton-mill did well for the company, and there was a  sobriety in the minds of the spinners and weavers, which showed that the  crisis of their political distemperature was over;—there was something  more of the old prudence in men’s reflections; and it was plain to see  that the elements of reconciliation were coming together throughout the  world.  The conflagration of the French Revolution was indeed not  extinguished, but it was evidently burning out; and their old reverence  for the Grand Monarque was beginning to revive among them, though they  only called him a consul.  Upon the king’s fast I preached on this  subject; and when the peace was concluded, I got great credit for my  foresight, but there was no merit in’t.  I had only lived longer than the  most of those around me, and had been all my days a close observer of the  signs of the times; so that what was lightly called prophecy and  prediction, were but a probability that experience had taught me to  discern.    In the affairs of the parish, the most remarkable generality (for we had  no particular catastrophe) was a great death of old people in the spring.  Among others, Miss Sabrina, the school mistress, paid the debt of nature,  but we could now better spare her than we did her predecessor; for at  Cayenneville there was a broken manufacturer’s wife, an excellent  teacher, and a genteel and modernised woman, who took the better order of  children; and Miss Sabrina having been long frail (for she was never  stout), a decent and discreet carlin, Mrs. M‘Caffie, the widow of a  custom-house officer, that was a native of the parish, set up another for  plainer work.  Her opposition Miss Sabrina did not mind, but she was  sorely displeased at the interloping of Mrs. Pirn at Cayenneville, and  some said it helped to kill her—of that, however, I am not so certain;  for Dr. Tanzey had told me in the winter, that he thought the sharp winds  in March would blow out her candle, as it was burnt to the snuff;  accordingly, she took her departure from this life, on the twenty-fifth  day of that month, after there had, for some days prior, been a most cold  and piercing east wind.    Miss Sabrina, who was always an oddity and aping grandeur, it was found,  had made a will, leaving her gatherings to her favourites, with all  regular formality.  To one she bequeathed a gown, to another this, and a  third that, and to me a pair of black silk stockings.  I was amazed when  I heard this; but judge what I felt, when a pair of old marrowless  stockings, darned in the heel, and not whole enough in the legs to make a  pair of mittens to Mrs. Balwhidder, were delivered to me by her executor,  Mr. Caption, the lawyer.  Saving, however, this kind of flummery, Miss  Sabrina was a harmless creature, and could quote poetry in discourse more  glibly than texts of Scripture—her father having spared no pains on her  mind: as for her body, it could not be mended; but that was not her  fault.    After her death, the session held a consultation, and we agreed to give  the same salary that Miss Sabrina enjoyed to Mrs. M‘Caffie, which angered  Mr. Cayenne, who thought it should have been given to the head mistress;  and it made him give Mrs. Pirn, out of his own pocket, double the sum.  But we considered that the parish funds were for the poor of the parish,  and therefore it was our duty to provide for the instruction of the poor  children.  Saving, therefore, those few notations, I have nothing further  to say concerning the topics and progress of this Ann. Dom.          CHAPTER XLII  YEAR 1801      IT is often to me very curious food for meditation, that as the parish  increased in population, there should have been less cause for matter to  record.  Things that in former days would have occasioned great discourse  and cogitation, are forgotten with the day in which they happen; and  there is no longer that searching into personalities which was so much in  vogue during the first epoch of my ministry, which I reckon the period  before the American war; nor has there been any such germinal changes  among us, as those which took place in the second epoch, counting  backward from the building of the cotton-mill that gave rise to the town  of Cayenneville.  But still we were not, even at this era, of which this  Ann. Dom. is the beginning, without occasional personality, or an event  that deserved to be called a germinal.    Some years before, I had noted among the callans at Mr. Lorimore’s school  a long soople laddie, who, like all bairns that grow fast and tall, had  but little smeddum.  He could not be called a dolt, for he was observant  and thoughtful, and giving to asking sagacious questions; but there was a  sleepiness about him, especially in the kirk, and he gave, as the master  said, but little application to his lessons, so that folk thought he  would turn out a sort of gaunt-at-the-door, more mindful of meat than  work.  He was, however, a good-natured lad; and, when I was taking my  solitary walks of meditation, I sometimes fell in with him sitting alone  on the brae by the water-side, and sometimes lying on the grass, with his  hands under his head, on the sunny green knolls where Mr. Cylinder, the  English engineer belonging to the cotton-work, has built the bonny house  that he calls Diryhill Cottage.  This was when Colin Mavis was a laddie  at the school, and when I spoke to him, I was surprised at the discretion  of his answers; so that gradually I began to think and say, that there  was more about Colin than the neighbours knew.  Nothing, however, for  many a day, came out to his advantage; so that his mother, who was by  this time a widow woman, did not well know what to do with him, and folk  pitied her heavy handful of such a droud.    By-and-by, however, it happened that one of the young clerks at the  cotton-mill shattered his right-hand thumb by a gun bursting; and, being  no longer able to write, was sent into the army to be an ensign, which  caused a vacancy in the office; and, through the help of Mr. Cayenne, I  got Colin Mavis into the place, where, to the surprise of everybody, he  proved a wonderful eident and active lad, and, from less to more, has  come at the head of all the clerks, and deep in the confidentials of his  employers.  But although this was a great satisfaction to me, and to the  widow woman his mother, it somehow was not so much so to the rest of the  parish, who seemed, as it were, angry that poor Colin had not proved  himself such a dolt as they had expected and foretold.    Among other ways that Colin had of spending his leisure, was that of  playing music on an instrument, in which it was said he made a wonderful  proficiency; but being long and thin, and of a delicate habit of body, he  was obligated to refrain from this recreation; so he betook himself to  books, and from reading he began to try writing; but, as this was done in  a corner, nobody jealoused what he was about, till one evening in this  year he came to the manse, and asked a word in private with me.  I  thought that perhaps he had fallen in with a lass, and was come to  consult me anent matrimony; but when we were by ourselves, in my study,  he took out of his pocket a number of the _Scots Magazine_, and said,  “Sir, you have been long pleased to notice me more than any other body,  and when I got this, I could not refrain from bringing it, to let you  see’t.  Ye maun ken, sir, that I have been long in secret given to trying  my hand at rhyme; and, wishing to ascertain what others thought of my  power in that way, I sent by the post twa three verses to the _Scots  Magazine_, and they have not only inserted them, but placed them in the  body of the book, in such a way that I kenna what to think.”  So I looked  at the Magazine, and read his verses, which were certainly very well-made  verses for one who had no regular education.  But I said to him, as the  Greenock magistrates said to John Wilson, the author of “Clyde,” when  they stipulated with him to give up the art, that poem-making was a  profane and unprofitable trade, and he would do well to turn his talent  to something of more solidity, which he promised to do; but he has since  put out a book, whereby he has angered all those that had foretold he  would be a do-nae-gude.  Thus has our parish walked sidy for sidy with  all the national improvements, having an author of its own, and getting a  literary character in the ancient and famous republic of letters.          CHAPTER XLIII  YEAR 1802      “EXPERIENCE teaches fools,” was the first moral apothegm that I wrote in  small text, when learning to write at the school, and I have ever since  thought it was a very sensible reflection.  For assuredly, as year after  year has flown away on the swift wings of time, I have found my  experience mellowing, and my discernment improving; by which I have, in  the afternoon of life, been enabled to foresee what kings and nations  would do, by the symptoms manifested within the bounds of the society  around me.  Therefore, at the beginning of the spring in this Ann. Dom.,  I had misgivings at the heart, a fluttering in my thoughts, and  altogether a strange uneasiness as to the stability of the peace and  harmony that was supposed to be founded upon a steadfast foundation  between us and the French people.  What my fears principally took their  rise from, was a sort of compliancy, on the part of those in power and  authority, to cultivate the old relations and parts between them and the  commonalty.  It did not appear to me that this proceeded from any known  or decided event, for I read the papers at this period daily; but from  some general dread and fear, that was begotten, like a vapour out of the  fermentation of all sorts of opinions; most people of any sagacity  thinking that the state of things in France being so much of an antic,  poetical, and playactor-like guise, that it would never obtain that  respect, far less that reverence from the world, which is necessary to  the maintenance of all beneficial government.  The consequence of this  was a great distrust between man and man, and an aching restlessness  among those who had their bread to bake in the world; persons possessing  the power to provide for their kindred, forcing them, as it were, down  the throats of those who were dependent on them in business, a bitter  morsel.    But the pith of these remarks chiefly applies to the manufacturing  concerns of the new town of Cayenneville; for in the clachan we lived in  the lea of the dike, and were more taken up with our own natural rural  affairs, and the markets for victual, than the craft of merchandise.  The  only man interested in business, who walked in a steady manner at his old  pace, though he sometimes was seen, being of a spunkie temper, grinding  the teeth of vexation, was Mr. Cayenne himself.    One day, however, he came to me at the manse.  “Doctor,” says he, for so  he always called me, “I want your advice.  I never choose to trouble  others with my private affairs; but there are times when the word of an  honest man may do good.  I need not tell you, that when I declared myself  a Royalist in America, it was at a considerable sacrifice.  I have,  however, nothing to complain of against government on that score; but I  think it damn’d hard that those personal connexions, whose interests I  preserved to the detriment of my own, should in my old age make such an  ungrateful return.  By the steps I took prior to quitting America, I  saved the property of a great mercantile concern in London.  In return  for that, they took a share with me, and for me, in the cotton-mill; and  being here on the spot, as manager, I have both made and saved them  money.  I have, no doubt, bettered my own fortune in the mean time.  Would you believe it, doctor, they have written a letter to me, saying  that they wish to provide for a relation, and requiring me to give up to  him a portion of my share in the concern—a pretty sort of providing this,  at another man’s expense!  But I’ll be damn’d if I do any such thing!  If  they want to provide for their friend, let them do so from themselves,  and not at my cost—What is your opinion?”    This appeared to me a very weighty concern, and, not being versed in  mercantile dealing, I did not well know what to say; but I reflected for  some time, and then I replied, “As far, Mr. Cayenne, as my observation  has gone in this world, I think that the giffs and the gaffs nearly  balance one another; and when they do not, there is a moral defect on the  failing side.  If a man long gives his labour to his employer, and is  paid for that labour, it might be said that both are equal; but I say no.  For it’s in human nature to be prompt to change; and the employer, having  always more in his power than his servant or agent, it seems to me a  clear case, that in the course of a number of years, the master of the  old servant is the obligated of the two; and therefore I say, in the  first place, in your case there is no tie or claim, by which you may, in  a moral sense, be called upon to submit to the dictates of your London  correspondents; but there is a reason, in the nature of the thing and  case, by which you may ask a favour from them—So, the advice I would give  you would be this: write an answer to their letter, and tell them that  you have no objection to the taking in of a new partner, but you think it  would be proper to revise all the copartnery, especially as you have,  considering the manner in which you have advanced the business, been of  opinion, that your share should be considerably enlarged.”    I thought Mr. Cayenne would have louped out of his skin with mirth at  this notion; and, being a prompt man, he sat down at my scrutoire, and  answered the letter which gave him so much uneasiness.  No notice was  taken of it for some time; but in the course of a month he was informed,  that it was not considered expedient at that time to make any change in  the company.  I thought the old man was gone by himself when he got this  letter.  He came over instantly in his chariot, from the cotton-mill  office to the manse, and swore an oath, by some dreadful name, that I was  a Solomon.  However, I only mention this to show how experience had  instructed me, and as a sample of that sinister provisioning of friends  that was going on in the world at this time—all owing, as I do verily  believe, to the uncertain state of governments and national affairs.    Besides these generalities, I observed another thing working to  effect—mankind read more, and the spirit of reflection and reasoning was  more awake than at any time within my remembrance.  Not only was there a  handsome bookseller’s shop in Cayenneville, with a London newspaper  daily, but magazines, and reviews, and other new publications.    Till this year, when a chaise was wanted we had to send to Irville; but  Mr. Toddy of the Cross-Keys being in at Glasgow, he bought an excellent  one at the second-hand, a portion of the effects of a broken merchant, by  which, from that period, we had one of our own, and it proved a great  convenience; for I, who never but twice in my life before hired that kind  of commodity, had it thrice during the summer, for a bit jaunt with Mrs.  Balwhidder to divers places and curiosities in the county that I had not  seen before, by which our ideas were greatly enlarged; indeed, I have  always had a partiality for travelling, as one of the best means of  opening the faculty of the mind, and giving clear and correct notions of  men and things.          CHAPTER XLIV  YEAR 1803      DURING the tempestuous times that ensued, from the death of the King of  France by the hands of the executioner in 1793, there had been a  political schism among my people that often made me very uneasy.  The  folk belonging to the cotton-mill, and the muslin-weavers in  Cayenneville, were afflicted with the itch of jacobinism, but those of  the village were stanch and true to king and country; and some of the  heritors were desirous to make volunteers of the young men of them, in  case of anything like the French anarchy and confusion rising on the side  of the manufacturers.  I, however, set myself, at that time, against  this, for I foresaw that the French business was but a fever which would  soon pass off; but no man could tell the consequence of putting arms in  the hands of neighbour against neighbour, though it was but in the way of  policy.    But when Bonaparte gathered his host fornent the English coast, and the  government at London were in terror of their lives for an invasion, all  in the country saw that there was danger, and I was not backward in  sounding the trumpet to battle.  For a time, however, there was a  diffidence among us somewhere.  The gentry had a distrust of the  manufacturers, and the farming lads were wud with impatience, that those  who should be their leaders would not come forth.  I, knowing this,  prepared a sermon suitable to the occasion, giving out from the pulpit  myself, the Sabbath before preaching it, that it was my intent, on the  next Lord’s day, to deliver a religious and political exhortation on the  present posture of public affairs.  This drew a vast congregation of all  ranks.    I trow that the stoor had no peace in the stuffing of the pulpit in that  day; and the effect was very great and speedy: for next morning the  weavers and cotton-mill folk held a meeting, and they, being skilled in  the ways of committees and associating together, had certain resolutions  prepared, by which a select few was appointed to take an enrolment of all  willing in the parish to serve as volunteers in defence of their king and  country, and to concert with certain gentlemen named therein, about the  formation of a corps, of which, it was an understood thing, the said  gentlemen were to be the officers.  The whole of this business was  managed with the height of di",-69.45,22.6,61.6,8.73,77.2,12.69,1936,17.333333333333332,65.59,12th and 13th grade
9,Selected Storiesr,"to her needs; and Carry had noted  this habit.    Mrs. Tretherick mechanically closed the shutters, lit the lights, and  opened the paper. Her eye fell instinctively on the following paragraph  in the telegraphic column:      FIDDLETOWN, 7th.--Mr. James Tretherick, an old resident of this place,  died last night of delirium tremens. Mr. Tretherick was addicted to  intemperate habits, said to have been induced by domestic trouble.      Mrs. Tretherick did not start. She quietly turned over another page of  the paper, and glanced at Carry. The child was absorbed in a book. Mrs.  Tretherick uttered no word, but during the remainder of the evening was  unusually silent and cold. When Carry was undressed and in bed, Mrs.  Tretherick suddenly dropped on her knees beside the bed, and, taking  Carry's flaming head between her hands, said:    “Should you like to have another papa, Carry, darling?”    “No,” said Carry, after a moment's thought.    “But a papa to help Mamma take care of you, to love you, to give you  nice clothes, to make a lady of you when you grow up?”    Carry turned her sleepy eyes toward the questioner. “Should YOU, Mamma?”    Mrs. Tretherick suddenly flushed to the roots of her hair. “Go to  sleep,” she said sharply, and turned away.    But at midnight the child felt two white arms close tightly around her,  and was drawn down into a bosom that heaved, fluttered, and at last was  broken up by sobs.    “Don't ky, Mamma,” whispered Carry, with a vague retrospect of their  recent conversation. “Don't ky. I fink I SHOULD like a new papa, if he  loved you very much--very, very much!”    A month afterward, to everybody's astonishment, Mrs. Tretherick was  married. The happy bridegroom was one Colonel Starbottle, recently  elected to represent Calaveras County in the legislative councils of the  State. As I cannot record the event in finer language than that used by  the correspondent of THE SACRAMENTO GLOBE, I venture to quote some of  his graceful periods. “The relentless shafts of the sly god have been  lately busy among our gallant Solons. We quote 'one more unfortunate.'  The latest victim is the Hon. C. Starbottle of Calaveras. The fair  enchantress in the case is a beautiful widow, a former votary of  Thespis, and lately a fascinating St. Cecilia of one of the most  fashionable churches of San Francisco, where she commanded a high  salary.”    THE DUTCH FLAT INTELLIGENCER saw fit, however, to comment upon the fact  with that humorous freedom characteristic of an unfettered press. “The  new Democratic war horse from Calaveras has lately advented in the  legislature with a little bill to change the name of Tretherick  to Starbottle. They call it a marriage certificate down there. Mr.  Tretherick has been dead just one month; but we presume the gallant  colonel is not afraid of ghosts.” It is but just to Mrs. Tretherick  to state that the colonel's victory was by no means an easy one. To  a natural degree of coyness on the part of the lady was added the  impediment of a rival--a prosperous undertaker from Sacramento, who  had first seen and loved Mrs. Tretherick at the theater and church, his  professional habits debarring him from ordinary social intercourse, and  indeed any other than the most formal public contact with the sex. As  this gentleman had made a snug fortune during the felicitous prevalence  of a severe epidemic, the colonel regarded him as a dangerous rival.  Fortunately, however, the undertaker was called in professionally to lay  out a brother senator, who had unhappily fallen by the colonel's pistol  in an affair of honor; and either deterred by physical consideration  from rivalry, or wisely concluding that the colonel was professionally  valuable, he withdrew from the field.    The honeymoon was brief, and brought to a close by an untoward incident.  During their bridal trip, Carry had been placed in the charge of  Colonel Starbottle's sister. On their return to the city, immediately on  reaching their lodgings, Mrs. Starbottle announced her intention of at  once proceeding to Mrs. Culpepper's to bring the child home. Colonel  Starbottle, who had been exhibiting for some time a certain uneasiness  which he had endeavored to overcome by repeated stimulation, finally  buttoned his coat tightly across his breast, and after walking  unsteadily once or twice up and down the room, suddenly faced his wife  with his most imposing manner.    “I have deferred,” said the colonel with an exaggeration of port that  increased with his inward fear, and a growing thickness of speech--“I  have deferr--I may say poshponed statement o' fack thash my duty ter  dishclose ter ye. I did no wish to mar sushine mushal happ'ness, to  bligh bud o' promise, to darken conjuglar sky by unpleasht revelashun.  Musht be done--by God, m'm, musht do it now. The chile is gone!”    “Gone!” echoed Mrs. Starbottle.    There was something in the tone of her voice, in the sudden  drawing-together of the pupils of her eyes, that for a moment nearly  sobered the colonel, and partly collapsed his chest.    “I'll splain all in a minit,” he said with a deprecating wave of the  hand. “Everything shall be splained. The-the-the-melencholly event  wish preshipitate our happ'ness--the myster'us prov'nice wish releash  you--releash chile! hunerstan?--releash chile. The mom't Tretherick  die--all claim you have in chile through him--die too. Thash law. Who's  chile b'long to? Tretherick? Tretherick dead. Chile can't b'long dead  man. Damn nonshense b'long dead man. I'sh your chile? no! whose chile  then? Chile b'long to 'ts mother. Unnerstan?”    “Where is she?” said Mrs. Starbottle, with a very white face and a very  low voice.    “I'll splain all. Chile b'long to 'ts mother. Thash law. I'm lawyer,  leshlator, and American sis'n. Ish my duty as lawyer, as leshlator, and  'merikan sis'n to reshtore chile to suff'rin mother at any coss--any  coss.”    “Where is she?” repeated Mrs. Starbottle, with her eyes still fixed on  the colonel's face.    “Gone to 'ts m'o'r. Gone East on shteamer, yesserday. Waffed by fav'rin  gales to suff'rin p'rent. Thash so!”    Mrs. Starbottle did not move. The colonel felt his chest slowly  collapsing, but steadied himself against a chair, and endeavored to beam  with chivalrous gallantry not unmixed with magisterial firmness upon her  as she sat.    “Your feelin's, m'm, do honor to yer sex, but conshider situashun.  Conshider m'or's feelings--conshider MY feelin's.” The colonel paused,  and flourishing a white handkerchief, placed it negligently in his  breast, and then smiled tenderly above it, as over laces and ruffles, on  the woman before him. “Why should dark shed-der cass bligh on two sholes  with single beat? Chile's fine chile, good chile, but summonelse chile!  Chile's gone, Clar'; but all ish'n't gone, Clar'. Conshider dearesht,  you all's have me!”    Mrs. Starbottle started to her feet. “YOU!” she cried, bringing out a  chest note that made the chandeliers ring--“You that I married to give  my darling food and clothes--YOU! a dog that I whistled to my side to  keep the men off me--YOU!”    She choked up, and then dashed past him into the inner room, which had  been Carry's; then she swept by him again into her own bedroom, and then  suddenly reappeared before him, erect, menacing, with a burning fire  over her cheekbones, a quick straightening of her arched brows and  mouth, a squaring of jaw, and ophidian flattening of the head.    “Listen!” she said in a hoarse, half-grown boy's voice. “Hear me! If  you ever expect to set eyes on me again, you must find the child. If you  ever expect to speak to me again, to touch me, you must bring her back.  For where she goes, I go; you hear me! Where she has gone, look for me.”    She struck out past him again with a quick feminine throwing-out of her  arms from the elbows down, as if freeing herself from some imaginary  bonds, and dashing into her chamber, slammed and locked the door.  Colonel Starbottle, although no coward, stood in superstitious fear  of an angry woman, and, recoiling as she swept by, lost his unsteady  foothold and rolled helplessly on the sofa. Here, after one or two  unsuccessful attempts to regain his foothold, he remained, uttering from  time to time profane but not entirely coherent or intelligible protests,  until at last he succumbed to the exhausting quality of his emotions,  and the narcotic quantity of his potations.    Meantime, within, Mrs. Starbottle was excitedly gathering her valuables  and packing her trunk, even as she had done once before in the course  of this remarkable history. Perhaps some recollection of this was in her  mind; for she stopped to lean her burning cheeks upon her hand, as if  she saw again the figure of the child standing in the doorway, and heard  once more a childish voice asking, “Is it Mamma?” But the epithet now  stung her to the quick, and with a quick, passionate gesture she dashed  it away with a tear that had gathered in her eye. And then it chanced  that, in turning over some clothes, she came upon the child's slipper  with a broken sandal string. She uttered a great cry here--the first she  had uttered--and caught it to her breast, kissing it passionately again  and again, and rocking from side to side with a motion peculiar to her  sex. And then she took it to the window, the better to see it through  her now streaming eyes. Here she was taken with a sudden fit of coughing  that she could not stifle with the handkerchief she put to her feverish  lips. And then she suddenly grew very faint. The window seemed to recede  before her, the floor to sink beneath her feet; and staggering to the  bed, she fell prone upon it with the sandal and handkerchief pressed  to her breast. Her face was quite pale, the orbit of her eyes dark; and  there was a spot upon her lip, another on her handkerchief, and still  another on the white counterpane of the bed.    The wind had risen, rattling the window sashes and swaying the white  curtains in a ghostly way. Later, a gray fog stole softly over the  roofs, soothing the wind-roughened surfaces, and in-wrapping all things  in an uncertain light and a measureless peace. She lay there very  quiet--for all her troubles, still a very pretty bride. And on the  other side of the bolted door the gallant bridegroom, from his temporary  couch, snored peacefully.      A week before Christmas Day, 1870, the little town of Genoa, in the  State of New York, exhibited, perhaps more strongly than at any other  time, the bitter irony of its founders and sponsors. A driving snowstorm  that had whitened every windward hedge, bush, wall, and telegraph pole,  played around this soft Italian Capital, whirled in and out of the great  staring wooden Doric columns of its post office and hotel, beat upon the  cold green shutters of its best houses, and powdered the angular, stiff,  dark figures in its streets. From the level of the street, the four  principal churches of the town stood out starkly, even while their  misshapen spires were kindly hidden in the low, driving storm. Near  the railroad station, the new Methodist chapel, whose resemblance to  an enormous locomotive was further heightened by the addition of a  pyramidal row of front steps, like a cowcatcher, stood as if waiting for  a few more houses to be hitched on to proceed to a pleasanter  location. But the pride of Genoa--the great Crammer Institute for Young  Ladies--stretched its bare brick length and reared its cupola plainly  from the bleak Parnassian hill above the principal avenue. There was  no evasion in the Crammer Institute of the fact that it was a public  institution. A visitor upon its doorsteps, a pretty face at its window,  were clearly visible all over the township.    The shriek of the engine of the four-o'clock Northern express brought  but few of the usual loungers to the depot. Only a single passenger  alighted, and was driven away in the solitary waiting sleigh toward the  Genoa Hotel. And then the train sped away again, with that passionless  indifference to human sympathies or curiosity peculiar to express  trains; the one baggage truck was wheeled into the station again; the  station door was locked; and the stationmaster went home.    The locomotive whistle, however, awakened the guilty consciousness  of three young ladies of the Crammer Institute, who were even then  surreptitiously regaling themselves in the bakeshop and confectionery  saloon of Mistress Phillips in a by-lane. For even the admirable  regulations of the Institute failed to entirely develop the physical  and moral natures of its pupils. They conformed to the excellent dietary  rules in public, and in private drew upon the luxurious rations of their  village caterer. They attended church with exemplary formality, and  flirted informally during service with the village beaux. They received  the best and most judicious instruction during school hours, and  devoured the trashiest novels during recess. The result of which was  an aggregation of quite healthy, quite human, and very charming young  creatures that reflected infinite credit on the Institute. Even Mistress  Phillips, to whom they owed vast sums, exhilarated by the exuberant  spirits and youthful freshness of her guests, declared that the sight of  “them young things” did her good, and had even been known to shield them  by shameless equivocation.    “Four o'clock, girls! and, if we're not back to prayers by five, we'll  be missed,” said the tallest of these foolish virgins, with an aquiline  nose, and certain quiet elan that bespoke the leader, as she rose  from her seat. “Have you got the books, Addy?” Addy displayed three  dissipated-looking novels under her waterproof. “And the provisions,  Carry?” Carry showed a suspicious parcel filling the pocket of her sack.  “All right, then. Come, girls, trudge--Charge it,” she added, nodding to  her host as they passed toward the door. “I'll pay you when my quarter's  allowance comes.”    “No, Kate,” interposed Carry, producing her purse, “let me pay; it's my  turn.”    “Never!” said Kate, arching her black brows loftily, “even if you do  have rich relatives, and regular remittances from California. Never!  Come, girls, forward, march!”    As they opened the door, a gust of wind nearly took them off their feet.  Kindhearted Mrs. Phillips was alarmed. “Sakes alive, galls! ye mussn't  go out in sich weather. Better let me send word to the Institoot, and  make ye up a nice bed tonight in my parlor.” But the last sentence was  lost in a chorus of half-suppressed shrieks as the girls, hand in hand,  ran down the steps into the storm, and were at once whirled away.    The short December day, unlit by any sunset glow, was failing fast. It  was quite dark already, and the air was thick with driving snow. For  some distance their high spirits, youth, and even inexperience kept them  bravely up; but, in ambitiously attempting a short cut from the highroad  across an open field, their strength gave out, the laugh grew less  frequent, and tears began to stand in Carry's brown eyes. When they  reached the road again, they were utterly exhausted. “Let us go back,”   said Carry.    “We'd never get across that field again,” said Addy.    “Let's stop at the first house, then,” said Carry.    “The first house,” said Addy, peering through the gathering darkness,  “is Squire Robinson's.” She darted a mischievous glance at Carry that,  even in her discomfort and fear, brought the quick blood to her cheek.    “Oh, yes!” said Kate with gloomy irony, “certainly; stop at the squire's  by all means, and be invited to tea, and be driven home after by your  dear friend Mr. Harry, with a formal apology from Mrs. Robinson, and  hopes that the young ladies may be excused this time. No!” continued  Kate with sudden energy. “That may suit YOU; but I'm going back as I  came--by the window, or not at all” Then she pounced suddenly, like a  hawk, on Carry, who was betraying a tendency to sit down on a snowbank  and whimper, and shook her briskly. “You'll be going to sleep next.  Stay, hold your tongues, all of you--what's that?”    It was the sound of sleigh bells. Coming down toward them out of the  darkness was a sleigh with a single occupant. “Hold down your heads,  girls: if it's anybody that knows us, we're lost.” But it was not, for a  voice strange to their ears, but withal very kindly and pleasant, asked  if its owner could be of any help to them. As they turned toward him,  they saw it was a man wrapped in a handsome sealskin cloak, wearing  a sealskin cap; his face, half-concealed by a muffler of the same  material, disclosing only a pair of long mustaches, and two keen  dark eyes. “It's a son of old Santa Claus!” whispered Addy. The girls  tittered audibly as they tumbled into the sleigh; they had regained  their former spirits. “Where shall I take you?” said the stranger  quietly. There was a hurried whispering; and then Kate said boldly, “To  the Institute.” They drove silently up the hill, until the long, ascetic  building loomed up before them. The stranger reined up suddenly. “You  know the way better than I,” he said. “Where do you go in?” “Through the  back window,” said Kate with sudden and appalling frankness. “I see!”   responded their strange driver quietly and, alighting quickly, removed  the bells from the horses. “We can drive as near as you please now,”   he added by way of explanation. “He certainly is a son of Santa Claus,”   whispered Addy. “Hadn't we better ask after his father?” “Hush!” said  Kate decidedly. “He is an angel, I dare say.” She added with a delicious  irrelevance, which was, however, perfectly understood by her feminine  auditors, “We are looking like three frights.”    Cautiously skirting the fences, they at last pulled up a few feet from  a dark wall. The stranger proceeded to assist them to alight. There  was still some light from the reflected snow; and as he handed his fair  companions to the ground, each was conscious of undergoing an intense  though respectful scrutiny. He assisted them gravely to open the window,  and then discreetly retired to the sleigh until the difficult and  somewhat discomposing ingress was made. He then walked to the window.  “Thank you and good night!” whispered three voices. A single figure  still lingered. The stranger leaned over the window sill. “Will you  permit me to light my cigar here? It might attract attention if I struck  a match outside.” By the upspringing light he saw the figure of Kate  very charmingly framed in by the window. The match burnt slowly out  in his fingers. Kate smiled mischievously. The astute young woman had  detected the pitiable subterfuge. For what else did she stand at the  head of her class, and had doting parents paid three years' tuition?    The storm had passed, and the sun was shining quite cheerily in the  eastern recitation room the next morning when Miss Kate, whose seat  was nearest the window, placing her hand pathetically upon her heart,  affected to fall in bashful and extreme agitation upon the shoulder of  Carry, her neighbor. “HE has come,” she gasped in a thrilling whisper.  “Who?” asked Carry sympathetically, who never clearly understood when  Kate was in earnest. “Who?--Why, the man who rescued us last night! I  saw him drive to the door this moment. Don't speak; I shall be better in  a moment--there!” she said, and the shameless hypocrite passed her hand  pathetically across her forehead with a tragic air.    “What can he want?” asked Carry, whose curiosity was excited. “I don't  know,” said Kate, suddenly relapsing into gloomy cynicism. “Possibly to  put his five daughters to school; perhaps to finish his young wife, and  warn her against us.”    “He didn't look old, and he didn't seem like a married man,” rejoined  Addy thoughtfully.    “That was his art, you poor creature!” returned Kate scornfully. “You  can never tell anything of these men, they are so deceitful. Besides,  it's just my fate!”    “Why, Kate,” began Carry, in serious concern.    “Hush! Miss Walker is saying something,” said Kate, laughing.    “The young ladies will please give attention,” said a slow, perfunctory  voice. “Miss Carry Tretherick is wanted in the parlor.”    Meantime Mr. Jack Prince, the name given on the card, and various  letters and credentials submitted to the Rev. Mr. Crammer, paced the  somewhat severe apartment known publicly as the “reception parlor” and  privately to the pupils as “purgatory.” His keen eyes had taken in the  various rigid details, from the flat steam “radiator,” like an enormous  japanned soda cracker, that heated one end of the room to the monumental  bust of Dr. Crammer that hopelessly chilled the other; from the Lord's  Prayer, executed by a former writing master in such gratuitous variety  of elegant calligraphic trifling as to abate considerably the serious  value of the composition, to three views of Genoa from the Institute,  which nobody ever recognized, taken on the spot by the drawing teacher;  from two illuminated texts of Scripture in an English letter, so  gratuitously and hideously remote as to chill all human interest, to a  large photograph of the senior class, in which the prettiest girls were  Ethiopian in complexion, and sat, apparently, on each other's heads  and shoulders. His fingers had turned listlessly the leaves of  school-catalogues, the SERMONS of Dr. Crammer, the POEMS of Henry Kirke  White, the LAYS OF THE SANCTUARY and LIVES OF CELEBRATED WOMEN. His  fancy, and it was a nervously active one, had gone over the partings  and greetings that must have taken place here, and wondered why the  apartment had yet caught so little of the flavor of humanity; indeed, I  am afraid he had almost forgotten the object of his visit when the door  opened, and Carry Tretherick stood before him.    It was one of those faces he had seen the night before, prettier even  than it had seemed then; and yet I think he was conscious of some  disappointment, without knowing exactly why. Her abundant waving hair  was of a guinea-golden tint, her complexion of a peculiar flowerlike  delicacy, her brown eyes of the color of seaweed in deep water. It  certainly was not her beauty that disappointed him.    Without possessing his sensitiveness to impression, Carry was, on her  part, quite as vaguely ill at ease. She saw before her one of those men  whom the sex would vaguely generalize as “nice,” that is to say, correct  in all the superficial appointments of style, dress, manners, and  feature. Yet there was a decidedly unconventional quality about him: he  was totally unlike anything or anybody that she could remember; and as  the attributes of originality are often as apt to alarm as to attract  people, she was not entirely prepossessed in his favor.    “I can hardly hope,” he began pleasantly, “that you remember me. It is  eleven years ago, and you were a very little girl. I am afraid I cannot  even claim to have enjoyed that familiarity that might exist between a  child of six and a young man of twenty-one. I don't think I was fond  of children. But I knew your mother very well. I was editor of the  AVALANCHE in Fiddletown when she took you to San Francisco.”    “You mean my stepmother; she wasn't my mother, you know,” interposed  Carry hastily.    Mr. Prince looked at her curiously. “I mean your stepmother,” he said  gravely. “I never had the pleasure of meeting your mother.”    “No; MOTHER hasn't been in California these twelve years.”    There was an intentional emphasizing of the title and of its distinction  that began to interest coldly Prince after his first astonishment was  past.    “As I come from your stepmother now,” he went on with a slight laugh,  “I must ask you to go back for a few moments to that point. After your  father's death, your mother--I mean your stepmother--recognized the fact  that your mother, the first Mrs. Tretherick, was legally and morally  your guardian and, although much against her inclination and affections,  placed you again in her charge.”    “My stepmother married again within a month after father died, and sent  me home,” said Carry with great directness, and the faintest toss of her  head.    Mr. Prince smiled so sweetly, and apparently so sympathetically, that  Carry began to like him. With no other notice of the interruption  he went on, “After your stepmother had performed this act of simple  justice, she entered into an agreement with your mother to defray the  expenses of your education until your eighteenth year, when you were to  elect and choose which of the two should thereafter be your guardian,  and with whom you would make your home. This agreement, I think, you are  already aware of, and, I believe, knew at the time.”    “I was a mere child then,” said Carry.    “Certainly,” said Mr. Prince, with the same smile. “Still the  conditions, I think, have never been oppressive to you nor your mother;  and the only time they are likely to give you the least uneasiness will  be when you come to make up your mind in the choice of your guardian.  That will be on your eighteenth birthday--the twentieth, I think, of the  present month.”    Carry was silent.    “Pray do not think that I am here to receive your decision, even if it  be already made. I only came to inform you that your stepmother, Mrs.  Starbottle, will be in town tomorrow, and will pass a few days at the  hotel. If it is your wish to see her before you make up your mind, she  will be glad to meet you. She does not, however, wish to do anything to  influence your judgment.    “Does Mother know she is coming?” said Carry hastily.    “I do not know,” said Prince gravely. “I only know that if you conclude  to see Mrs. Starbottle, it will be with your mother's permission. Mrs.  Starbottle will keep sacredly this part of the agreement, made ten years  ago. But her health is very poor; and the change and country quiet of  a few days may benefit her.” Mr. Prince bent his keen, bright eyes upon  the young girl, and almost held his breath until she spoke again.    “Mother's coming up today or tomorrow,” she said, looking up.    “Ah!” said Mr. Prince with a sweet and languid smile.    “Is Colonel Starbottle here too?” asked Carry, after a pause.    “Colonel Starbottle is dead. Your stepmother is again a widow.”    “Dead!” repeated Carry.    “Yes,” replied Mr. Prince. “Your stepmother has been singularly  unfortunate in surviving her affections.”    Carry did not know what he meant, and looked so. Mr. Prince smiled  reassuringly.    Presently Carry began to whimper.    Mr. Prince softly stepped beside her chair.    “I am afraid,” he said with a very peculiar light in his eye, and a  singular dropping of the corners of his mustache--“I am afraid you are  taking this too deeply. It will be some days before you are called upon  to make a decision. Let us talk of something else. I hope you caught no  cold last evening.”    Carry's face shone out again in dimples.    “You must have thought us so queer! It was too bad to give you so much  trouble.”    “None whatever, I assure you. My sense of propriety,” he added demurely,  “which might have been outraged had I been called upon to help three  young ladies out of a schoolroom window at night, was deeply gratified  at being able to assist them in again.” The doorbell rang loudly, and  Mr. Prince rose. “Take your own time, and think well before you make  your decision.” But Carry's ear and attention were given to the sound of  voices in the hall. At the same moment, the door was thrown open, and a  servant announced, “Mrs. Tretherick and Mr. Robinson.”    The afternoon train had just shrieked out its usual indignant protest at  stopping at Genoa at all as Mr. Jack Prince entered the outskirts of the  town, and drove toward his hotel. He was wearied and cynical. A drive  of a dozen miles through unpicturesque outlying villages, past small  economic farmhouses, and hideous villas that violated his fastidious  taste, had, I fear, left that gentleman in a captious state of mind.  He would have even avoided his taciturn landlord as he drove up to the  door; but that functionary waylaid him on the steps. “There's a lady  in the sittin'-room, waitin' for ye.” Mr. Prince hurried upstairs, and  entered the room as Mrs. Starbottle flew toward him.    She had changed sadly in the last ten years. Her figure was wasted  to half its size. The beautiful curves of her bust and shoulders were  broken or inverted. The once full, rounded arm was shrunken in its  sleeve; and the golden hoops that encircled her wan wrists almost  slipped from her hands as her long, scant fingers closed convulsively  around Jack's. Her cheekbones were painted that afternoon with the  hectic of fever: somewhere in the hollows of those cheeks were buried  the dimples of long ago, but their graves were forgotten. Her lustrous  eyes were still beautiful, though the orbits were deeper than before.  Her mouth was still sweet, although the lips parted more easily over the  little teeth, even in breathing, and showed more of them than she was  wont to do before. The glory of her blond hair was still left: it was  finer, more silken and ethereal, yet it failed even in its plenitude to  cover the hollows of the blue-veined temples.    “Clara!” said Jack reproachfully.    “Oh, forgive me, Jack!” she said, falling into a chair, but still  clinging to his hand--“forgive me, dear; but I could not wait longer. I  should have died, Jack--died before another night. Bear with me a little  longer (it will not be long), but let me stay. I may not see her, I  know; I shall not speak to her: but it's so sweet to feel that I am at  last near her, that I breathe the same air with my darling. I am better  already, Jack, I am indeed. And you have seen her today? How did  she look? What did she say? Tell me all, everything, Jack. Was she  beautiful? They say she is. Has she grown? Would you have known  her again? Will she come, Jack? Perhaps she has been here already;  perhaps”--she had risen with tremulous excitement, and was glancing at  the door--“perhaps she is here now. Why don't you speak, Jack? Tell me  all.”    The keen eyes that looked down into hers were glistening with an  infinite tenderness that none, perhaps, but she would have deemed them  capable of. “Clara,” he said gently and cheerily, “try and compose  yourself. You are trembling now with the fatigue and excitement of your  journey. I have seen Carry; she is well and beautiful. Let that suffice  you now.”    His gentle firmness composed and calmed her now, as it had often done  before. Stroking her thin hand, he said, after a pause, “Did Carry ever  write to you?”    “Twice, thanking me for some presents. They were only schoolgirl  letters,” she added, nervously answering the interrogation of his eyes.    “Did she ever know of your own troubles? of your poverty, of the  sacrifices you made to pay her bills, of your pawning your clothes and  jewels, of your--”    “No, no!” interrupted the woman quickly: “no! How could she? I have no  enemy cruel enough to tell her that.”    “But if she--or if Mrs. Tretherick--had heard of it? If Carry thought  you were poor, and unable to support her properly, it might influence  her decision. Young girls are fond of the position that wealth can give.  She may have rich friends, maybe a lover.”    Mrs. Starbottle winced at the last sentence. “But,” she said eagerly,  grasping Jack's hand, “when you found me sick and helpless at  Sacramento, when you--God bless you for it, Jack!--offered to help me to  the East, you said you knew of something, you had some plan, that would  make me and Carry independent.”    “Yes,” said Jack hastily; “but I want you to get strong and well first.  And, now that you are calmer, you shall listen to my visit to the  school.”    It was then that Mr. Jack Prince proceeded to describe the interview  already recorded, with a singular felicity and discretion that shames  my own account of that proceeding. Without suppressing a single fact,  without omitting a word or detail, he yet managed to throw a poetic veil  over that prosaic episode, to invest the heroine with a romantic roseate  atmosphere, which, though not perhaps entirely imaginary, still, I fear,  exhibited that genius which ten years ago had made the columns of THE  FIDDLETOWN AVALANCHE at once fascinating and instructive. It was not  until he saw the heightening color, and heard the quick breathing, of  his eager listener, that he felt a pang of self-reproach. “God help her  and forgive me!” he muttered between his clinched teeth; “but how can I  tell her ALL now!”    That night, when Mrs. Starbottle laid her weary head upon her pillow,  she tried to picture to herself Carry at the same moment sleeping  peacefully in the great schoolhouse on the hill; and it was a rare  comfort to this yearning, foolish woman to know that she was so  near. But at this moment Carry was sitting on the edge of her bed,  half-undressed, pouting her pretty lips and twisting her long, leonine  locks between her fingers as Miss Kate Van Corlear--dramatically  wrapped in a long white counterpane, her black eyes sparkling, and her  thoroughbred nose thrown high in air--stood over her like a wrathful and  indignant ghost; for Carry had that evening imparted her woes and her  history to Miss Kate, and that young lady had “proved herself no friend”   by falling into a state of fiery indignation over Carry's “ingratitude,”   and openly and shamelessly espousing the claims of Mrs. Starbottle.  “Why, if the half you tell me is true, your mother and those Robinsons  are making of you not only a little coward, but a little snob, miss.  Respectability, forsooth! Look you, my family are centuries before the  Trethericks; but if my family had ever treated me in this way, and then  asked me to turn my back on my best friend, I'd whistle them down the  wind;” and here Kate snapped her fingers, bent her black brows, and  glared around the room as if in search of a recreant Van Corlear.    “You just talk this way because you have taken a fancy to that Mr.  Prince,” said Carry.    In the debasing slang of the period, that had even found its way  into the virgin cloisters of the Crammer Institute, Miss Kate, as she  afterward expressed it, instantly “went for her.”    First, with a shake of her head, she threw her long black hair over one  shoulder, then, dropping one end of the counterpane from the other like  a vestal tunic, she stepped before Carry with a purposely exaggerated  classic stride. “And what if I have, miss! What if I happen to know a  gentleman when I see him! What if I happen to know that among a thousand  such traditional, conventional, feeble editions of their grandfathers  as Mr. Harry Robinson, you cannot find one original, independent,  individualized gentleman like your Prince! Go to bed, miss, and pray  to Heaven that he may be YOUR Prince indeed. Ask to have a contrite and  grateful heart, and thank the Lord in particular for having sent you  such a friend as Kate Van Corlear.” Yet, after an imposing dramatic  exit, she reappeared the next moment as a straight white flash, kissed  Carry between the brows, and was gone.    The next day was a weary one to Jack Prince. He was convinced in his  mind that Carry would not come; yet to keep this consciousness from  Mrs. Starbottle, to meet her simple hopefulness with an equal degree of  apparent faith, was a hard and difficult task. He would have tried to  divert her mind by taking her on a long drive; but she was fearful that  Carry might come during her absence; and her strength, he was obliged to  admit, had failed greatly. As he looked into her large and awe-inspiring  clear eyes, a something he tried to keep from his mind--to put off day  by day from contemplation--kept asserting itself directly to his inner  consciousness. He began to doubt the expediency and wisdom of his  management. He recalled every incident of his interview with Carry, and  half-believed that its failure was due to himself. Yet Mrs. Starbottle  was very patient and confident; her very confidence shook his faith in  his own judgment. When her strength was equal to the exertion, she was  propped up in her chair by the window, where she could see the school  and the entrance to the hotel. In the intervals she would elaborate  pleasant plans for the future, and would sketch a country home. She had  taken a strange fancy, as it seemed to Prince, to the present location;  but it was notable that the future, always thus outlined, was one of  quiet and repose. She believed she would get well soon; in fact, she  thought she was now much better than she had been, but it might be long  before she should be quite strong again. She would whisper on in this  way until Jack would dash madly down into the barroom, order liquors  that he did not drink, light cigars that he did not smoke, talk with men  that he did not listen to, and behave generally as our stronger sex is  apt to do in periods of delicate trials and perplexity.    The day closed with a clouded sky and a bitter, searching wind. With  the night fell a few wandering flakes of snow. She was still content  and hopeful; and, as Jack wheeled her from the window to the fire,  she explained to him how that, as the school term was drawing near its  close, Carry was probably kept closely at her lessons during the day,  and could only leave the school at night. So she sat up the greater part  of the evening, and combed her silken hair, and as far as her strength  would allow, made an undress toilet to receive her guest. “We must not  frighten the child, Jack,” she said apologetically, and with something  of her old coquetry.    It was with a feeling of relief that, at ten o'clock, Jack received a  message from the landlord, saying that the doctor would like to see him  for a moment downstairs. As Jack entered the grim, dimly lighted parlor,  he observed the hooded figure of a woman near the fire. He was about to  withdraw again when a voice that he remembered very pleasantly said:    “Oh, it's all right! I'm the doctor.”    The hood was thrown back, and Prince saw the shining black hair and  black, audacious eyes of Kate Van Corlear.    “Don't ask any questions. I'm the doctor, and there's my prescription,”   and she pointed to the half-frightened, half-sobbing Carry in the  corner--“to be taken at once.”    “Then Mrs. Tretherick has given her permission?”    “Not much, if I know the sentiments of that lady,” replied Kate saucily.    “Then how did you get away?” asked Prince gravely.    “BY THE WINDOW.”    When Mr. Prince had left Carry in the arms of her stepmother, he  returned to the parlor.    “Well?” demanded Kate.    “She will stay--YOU will, I hope, also--tonight.”    “As I shall not be eighteen, and my own mistress on the twentieth, and  as I haven't a sick stepmother, I won't.”    “Then you will give me the pleasure of seeing you safely through the  window again?”    When Mr. Prince returned an hour later, he found Carry sitting on a low  stool at Mrs. Starbottle's feet. Her head was in her stepmother's lap,  and she had sobbed herself to sleep. Mrs. Starbottle put her finger  to her lip. “I told you she would come. God bless you, Jack! and good  night.”    The next morning Mrs. Tretherick, indignant, the Rev. Asa Crammer,  principal, injured, and Mr. Joel Robinson, Sr., complacently  respectable, called upon Mr. Prince. There was a stormy meeting, ending  in a demand for Carry. “We certainly cannot admit of this interference,”   said Mrs. Tretherick, a fashionably dressed, indistinctive-looking  woman. “It is several days before the expiration of our agreement; and  we do not feel, under the circumstances, justified in releasing Mrs.  Starbottle from its conditions.” “Until the expiration of the school  term, we must consider Miss Tretherick as complying entirely with its  rules and discipline,” imposed Dr. Crammer. “The whole proceeding is  calculated to injure the prospects, and compromise the position, of Miss  Tretherick in society,” suggested Mr. Robinson.    In vain Mr. Prince urged the failing condition of Mrs. Starbottle, her  absolute freedom from complicity with Carry's flight, the pardonable  and natural instincts of the girl, and his own assurance that they were  willing to abide by her decision. And then, with a rising color in  his cheek, a dangerous look in his eye, but a singular calmness in his  speech, he added:    “One word more. It becomes my duty to inform you of a circumstance which  would certainly justify me, as an executor of the late Mr. Tretherick,  in fully resisting your demands. A few months after Mr. Tretherick's  death, through the agency of a Chinaman in his employment, it was  discovered that he had made a will, which was subsequently found among  his papers. The insignificant value of his bequest--mostly land, then  quite valueless--prevented his executors from carrying out his wishes,  or from even proving the will, or making it otherwise publicly known,  until within the last two or three years, when the property had  enormously increased in value. The provisions of that bequest are  simple, but unmistakable. The property is divided between Carry and  her stepmother, with the explicit condition that Mrs. Starbottle shall  become her legal guardian, provide for her education, and in all details  stand to her IN LOCO PARENTIS.”    “What is the value of this bequest?” asked Mr. Robinson. “I cannot  tell exactly, but not far from half a million, I should say,” returned  Prince. “Certainly, with this knowledge, as a friend of Miss Tretherick  I must say that her conduct is as judicious as it is honorable to her,”   responded Mr. Robinson. “I shall not presume to question the wishes,  or throw any obstacles in the way of carrying out the intentions, of my  dead husband,” added Mrs. Tretherick; and the interview was closed.    When its result was made known to Mrs. Starbottle, she raised Jack's  hand to her feverish lips. “It cannot add to MY happiness now, Jack; but  tell me, why did you keep it from her?” Jack smiled, but did not reply.    Within the next week the necessary legal formalities were concluded, and  Carry was restored to her stepmother. At Mrs. Starbottle's request, a  small house in the outskirts of the town was procured; and thither they  removed to wait the spring, and Mrs. Starbottle's convalescence. Both  came tardily that year.    Yet she was happy and patient. She was fond of watching the budding  of the trees beyond her window--a novel sight to her Californian  experience--and of asking Carry their names and seasons. Even at this  time she projected for that summer, which seemed to her so mysteriously  withheld, long walks with Carry through the leafy woods, whose gray,  misty ranks she could see along the hilltop. She even thought she  could write poetry about them, and recalled the fact as evidence of her  gaining strength; and there is, I believe, still treasured by one of the  members of this little household a little carol so joyous, so simple,  and so innocent that it might have been an echo of the robin that called  to her from the window, as perhaps it was.    And then, without warning, there dropped from Heaven a day so tender, so  mystically soft, so dreamily beautiful, so throbbing and alive with the  fluttering of invisible wings, so replete and bounteously overflowing  with an awakening and joyous resurrection not taught by man or limited  by creed, that they thought it fit to bring her out and lay her in that  glorious sunshine that sprinkled like the droppings of a bridal torch  the happy lintels and doors. And there she lay beatified and calm.    Wearied by watching, Carry had fallen asleep by her side; and Mrs.  Starbottle's thin fingers lay like a benediction on her head. Presently  she called Jack to her side.    “Who was that,” she whispered, “who just came in?”    “Miss Van Corlear,” said Jack, answering the look in her great hollow  eyes.    “Jack,” she said, after a moment's silence, “sit by me a moment; dear  Jack: I've something I must say. If I ever seemed hard, or cold, or  coquettish to you in the old days, it was because I loved you, Jack, too  well to mar your future by linking it with my own. I always loved you,  dear Jack, even when I seemed least worthy of you. That is gone now. But  I had a dream lately, Jack, a foolish woman's dream--that you might find  what I lacked in HER,” and she glanced lovingly at the sleeping girl at  her side; “that you might love her as you have loved me. But even that  is not to be, Jack, is it?” and she glanced wistfully in his face. Jack  pressed her hand, but did not speak. After a few moments' silence, she  again said: “Perhaps you are right in your choice. She is a goodhearted  girl, Jack--but a little bold.”    And with this last flicker of foolish, weak humanity in her struggling  spirit, she spoke no more. When they came to her a moment later, a tiny  bird that had lit upon her breast flew away; and the hand that they  lifted from Carry's head fell lifeless at her side.          BARKER'S LUCK      A bird twittered! The morning sun shining through the open window was  apparently more potent than the cool mountain air, which had only caused  the sleeper to curl a little more tightly in his blankets. Barker's eyes  opened instantly upon the light and the bird on the window ledge. Like  all healthy young animals he would have tried to sleep again, but with  his momentary consciousness came the recollection that it was his turn  to cook the breakfast that morning, and he regretfully rolled out of  his bunk to the floor. Without stopping to dress, he opened the door and  stepped outside, secure in the knowledge that he was overlooked only by  the Sierras, and plunged his head and shoulders in the bucket of cold  water that stood by the door. Then he began to clothe himself, partly in  the cabin and partly in the open air, with a lapse between the putting  on of his trousers and coat which he employed in bringing in wood.  Raking together the few embers on the adobe hearth, not without a  prudent regard to the rattlesnake which had once been detected in  haunting the warm ashes, he began to prepare breakfast. By this time the  other sleepers, his partners Stacy and Demorest, young men of about his  own age, were awake, alert, and lazily critical of his progress.    “I don't care about my quail on toast being underdone for breakfast,”   said Stacy, with a yawn; “and you needn't serve with red wine. I'm not  feeling very peckish this morning.”    “And I reckon you can knock off the fried oysters after the Spanish  mackerel for ME,” said Demorest gravely. “The fact is, that last bottle  of Veuve Clicquot we had for supper wasn't as dry as I am this morning.”    Accustomed to these regular Barmecide suggestions, Barker made no direct  reply. Presently, looking up from the fire, he said, “There's no more  saleratus, so you mustn't blame me if the biscuit is extra heavy. I told  you we had none when you went to the grocery yesterday.”    “And I told you we hadn't a red cent to buy any with,” said Stacy, who  was also treasurer. “Put these two negatives together and you make the  affirmative--saleratus. Mix freely and bake in a hot oven.”    Nevertheless, after a toilet as primitive as Barker's they sat down to  what he had prepared with the keen appetite begotten of the mountain  air and the regretful fastidiousness born of the recollection of better  things. Jerked beef, frizzled with salt pork in a frying-pan, boiled  potatoes, biscuit, and coffee composed the repast. The biscuits,  however, proving remarkably heavy after the first mouthful, were used  as missiles, thrown through the open door at an empty bottle which had  previously served as a mark for revolver practice, and a few moments  later pipes were lit to counteract the effects of the meal and take  the taste out of their mouths. Suddenly they heard the sound of horses'  hoofs, saw the quick passage of a rider in the open space before the  cabin, and felt the smart impact upon the table of some small object  thrown by him. It was the regular morning delivery of the county  newspaper!    “He's getting to be a mighty sure shot,” said Demorest approvingly,  looking at his upset can of coffee as he picked up the paper, rolled  into a cylindrical wad as tightly as a cartridge, and began to  straighten it out. This was no easy matter, as the sheet had evidently  been rolled while yet damp from the press; but Demorest eventually  opened it and ensconced himself behind it.    “Nary news?” asked Stacy.    “No. There never is any,” said Demorest scornfully. “We ought to stop  the paper.”    “You mean the paper man ought to. WE don't pay him,” said Barker gently.    “Well, that's the same thing, smarty. No news, no pay. Hallo!” he  continued, his eyes suddenly riveted on the paper. Then, after the  fashion of ordinary humanity, he stopped short and read the interesting  item to himself. When he had finished he brought his fist and the paper,  together, violently down upon the table. “Now look at this! Talk of  luck, will you? Just think of it. Here are WE--hard-working men with  lots of sabe, too--grubbin' away on this hillside like niggers, glad  to get enough at the end of the day to pay for our soggy biscuits and  horse-bean coffee, and just look what falls into the lap of some lazy  sneakin' greenhorn who never did a stoke of work in his life! Here are  WE, with no foolishness, no airs nor graces, and yet men who would do  credit to twice that amount of luck--and seem born to it, too--and we're  set aside for some long, lank, pen-wiping scrub who just knows enough to  sit down on his office stool and hold on to a bit of paper.”    “What's up now?” asked Stacy, with the carelessness begotten of  familiarity with his partner's extravagance.    “Listen,” said Demorest, reading. “Another unprecedented rise has taken  place in the shares of the 'Yellow Hammer First Extension Mine' since  the sinking of the new shaft. It was quoted yesterday at ten thousand  dollars a foot. When it is remembered that scarcely two years ago the  original shares, issued at fifty dollars per share, had dropped to only  fifty cents a share, it will be seen that those who were able to hold on  have got a good thing.”    “What mine did you say?” asked Barker, looking up meditatively from the  dishes he was already washing.    “The Yellow Hammer First Extension,” returned Demorest shortly.    “I used to have some shares in that, and I think I have them still,”   said Barker musingly.    “Yes,” said Demorest promptly; “the paper speaks of it here. 'We  understand,'” he continued, reading aloud, “'that our eminent fellow  citizen, George Barker, otherwise known as “Get Left Barker” and  “Chucklehead,” is one of these fortunate individuals.'”    “No,” said Barker, with a slight flush of innocent pleasure, “it can't  say that. How could it know?”    Stacy laughed, but Demorest coolly continued: “You didn't hear all.  Listen! 'We say WAS one of them; but having already sold his apparently  useless certificates to our popular druggist, Jones, for corn plasters,  at a reduced rate, he is unable to realize.'”    “You may laugh, boys,” said Barker, with simple seriousness; “but I  really believe I have got 'em yet. Just wait. I'll see!” He rose and  began to drag out a well-worn valise from under his bunk. “You see,” he  continued, “they were given to me by an old chap in return--”    “For saving his life by delaying the Stockton boat that afterward blew  up,” returned Demorest briefly. “We know it all! His hair was white, and  his hand trembled slightly as he laid these shares in yours, saying, and  you never forgot the words, 'Take 'em, young man--and'--”    “For lending him two thousand dollars, then,” continued Barker with  a simple ignoring of the interruption, as he quietly brought out the  valise.    “TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS!” repeated Stacy. “When did YOU have two thousand  dollars?”    “When I first left Sacramento--three years ago,” said Barker,  unstrapping the valise.    “How long did you have it?” said Demorest incredulously.    “At least two days, I think,” returned Barker quietly. “Then I met that  man. He was hard-up, and I lent him my pile and took those shares. He  died afterward.”    “Of course he did,” said Demorest severely. “They always do. Nothing  kills a man more quickly than an action of that kind.” Nevertheless  the two partners regarded Barker rummaging among some loose clothes  and papers with a kind of paternal toleration. “If you can't find them,  bring out your government bonds,” suggested Stacy. But the next moment,  flushed and triumphant, Barker rose from his knees, and came toward them  carrying some papers in his hands. Demorest seized them from him, opened  them, spread them on the table, examined hurriedly the date, signatures,  and transfers, glanced again quickly at the newspaper paragraph, looked  wildly at Stacy and then at Barker, and gasped:    “By the living hookey! it is SO!”    “B'gosh! he HAS got 'em!” echoed Stacy.    “Twenty shares,” continued Demorest breathlessly, “at ten thousand  dollars a share--even if it's only a foot--is two hundred thousand  dollars! Jerusalem!”    “Tell me, fair sir,” said Stacy, with sparkling eyes, “hast still left  in yonder casket any rare jewels, rubies, sarcenet, or links of fine  gold? Peradventure a pearl or two may have been overlooked!”    “No--that's all,” returned Barker simply.    “You hear him! Rothschild says 'that's all.' Prince Esterhazy says he  hasn't another red cent--only two hundred thousand dollars.”    “What ought I to do, boys?” asked Barker, timidly glancing from one to  the other. Yet he remembered with delight all that day, and for many  a year afterward, that he saw in their faces only unselfish joy and  affection at that supreme moment.    “Do?” said Demorest promptly. “Stand on your head and yell! No! stop!  Come here!” He seized both Barker and Stacy by the hand, and ran out  into the open air. Here they danced violently with clasped hands around  a small buckeye, in perfect silence, and then returned to the cabin,  grave but perspiring.    “Of course,” said Barker, wiping his forehead, “we'll just get some  money on these certificates and buy up that next claim which belongs to  old Carter--where you know we thought we saw the indication.”    “We'll do nothing of the kind,” said Demorest decidedly. “WE ain't in  it. That money is yours, old chap--every cent of it--property acquired  before marriage, you know; and the only thing we'll do is to be damned  before we'll see you drop a dime of it into this Godforsaken hole. No!”    “But we're partners,” gasped Barker.    “Not in THIS! The utmost we can do for you, opulent sir--though it ill  becomes us horny-handed sons of toil to rub shoulders with Dives--is  perchance to dine with you, to take a pasty and a glass of Malvoisie, at  some restaurant in Sacramento--when you've got things fixed, in honor of  your return to affluence. But more would ill become us!”    “But what are YOU going to do?” said Barker, with a half-hysteric,  half-frightened smile.    “We have not yet looked through our luggage,” said Demorest with  invincible gravity, “and there's a secret recess--a double FOND--to my  portmanteau, known only to a trusty page, which has not been disturbed  since I left my ancestral home in Faginia. There may be a few First  Debentures of Erie or what not still there.”    “I felt some strange, disklike protuberances in my dress suit the other  day, but belike they are but poker chips,” said Stacy thoughtfully.    An uneasy feeling crept over Barker. The color which had left his fresh  cheek returned to it quickly, and he turned his eyes away. Yet he had  seen nothing in his companions' eyes but affection--with even a certain  kind of tender commiseration that deepened his uneasiness. “I suppose,”   he said desperately, after a pause, “I ought to go over to Boomville and  make some inquiries.”    “At the bank, old chap; at the bank!” said Demorest emphatically. “Take  my advice and don't go ANYWHERE ELSE. Don't breathe a word of your luck  to anybody. And don't, whatever you do, be tempted to sell just now; you  don't know how high that stock's going to jump yet.”    “I thought,” stammered Barker, “that you boys might like to go over with  me.”    “We can't afford to take another holiday on grub wages, and we're only  two to work today,” said Demorest, with a slight increase of color and  the faintest tremor in his voice. “And it won't do, old chap, for us to  be seen bumming round with you on the heels of your good fortune. For  everybody knows we're poor, and sooner or later everybody'll know you  WERE rich even when you first came to us.”    “Nonsense!” said Barker indignantly.    “Gospel, my boy!” said Demorest shortly.    “The frozen truth, old man!” said Stacy.    Barker took up his hat with some stiffness and moved toward the door.  Here he stopped irresolutely, an irresolution that seemed to communicate  itself to his partners. There was a moment's awkward silence. Then  Demorest suddenly seized him by the shoulders with a grip that was  half a caress, and walked him rapidly to the door. “And now don't stand  foolin' with us, Barker boy; but just trot off like a little man, and  get your grip on that fortune; and when you've got your hooks in it hang  on like grim death. You'll”--he hesitated for an instant only, possibly  to find the laugh that should have accompanied his speech--“you're sure  to find US here when you get back.”    Hurt to the quick, but restraining his feelings, Barker clapped his hat  on his head and walked quickly away. The two partners stood watching him  in silence until his figure was lost in the underbrush. Then they spoke.    “Like him--wasn't it?” said Demorest.    “Just him all over,” said Stacy.    “Think of him having that stock stowed away all these years and never  even bothering his dear old head about it!”    “And think of his wanting to put the whole thing into this rotten  hillside with us!”    “And he'd have done it, by gosh! and never thought of it again. That's  Barker.”    “Dear old man!”    “Good old chap!”    “I've been wondering if one of us oughtn't to have gone with him? He's  just as likely to pour his money into the first lap that opens for it,”   said Stacy.    “The more reason why we shouldn't prevent him, or seem to prevent him,”   said Demorest almost fiercely. “There will be knaves and fools enough  who will try and put the idea of our using him into his simple heart  without that. No! Let him do as he likes with it--but let him be  himself. I'd rather have him come back to us even after he's lost the  money--his old self and empty-handed--than try to change the stuff God  put into him and make him more like others.”    The tone and manner were so different from Demorest's usual levity that  Stacy was silent. After a pause he said: “Well! we shall miss him on the  hillside--won't we?”    Demorest did not reply. Reaching out his hand abstractedly, he wrenched  off a small slip from a sapling near him, and began slowly to pull the  leaves off, one by one, until they were all gone. Then he switched it in  the air, struck his bootleg smartly with it, said roughly: “Come, let's  get to work!” and strode away.    Meantime Barker on his way to Boomville was no less singular in his  manner. He kept up his slightly affected attitude until he had lost  sight of the cabin. But, being of a simple nature, his emotions were  less complex. If he had not seen the undoubted look of affection in the  eyes of his partners he would have imagined that they were jealous of  his good fortune. Yet why had they refused his offer to share it with  him? Why had they so strangely assumed that their partnership with him  had closed? Why had they declined to go with him? Why had this  money--of which he had thought so little, and for which he had cared  so little--changed them toward him? It had not changed HIM--HE was  the same! He remembered how they had often talked and laughed over  a prospective “strike” in mining and speculated what THEY would do  together with the money! And now that “luck” had occurred to one of  them, individually, the effect was only to alienate them! He could not  make it out. He was hurt, wounded--yet oddly enough he was conscious now  of a certain power within him to hurt and wound in retribution. He was  rich: he would let them see HE could do without them. He was quite free  now to think only of himself and Kitty.    For it must be recorded that with all this young gentleman's simplicity  and unselfishness, with all his loyal attitude to his partners, his  FIRST thought at the moment he grasped the fact of his wealth was of  a young lady. It was Kitty Carter, the daughter of the hotelkeeper at  Boomville, who owned the claim that the partners had mutually coveted.  That a pretty girl's face should flash upon him with his conviction that  he was now a rich man meant perhaps no disloyalty to his partners,  whom he would still have helped. But it occurred to him now, in his  half-hurt, half-vengeful state, that they had often joked him about  Kitty, and perhaps further confidence with them was debarred. And it was  only due to his dignity that he should now see Kitty at once.    This was easy enough, for in the naive simplicity of Boomville and the  economic arrangements of her father, she occasionally waited upon the  hotel table. Half the town was always actively in love with her; the  other half HAD BEEN, and was silent, cynical, but hopeless in defeat.  For Kitty was one of those singularly pretty girls occasionally met  with in Southwestern frontier civilization whose distinct and original  refinement of face and figure were so remarkable and original as to cast  a doubt on the sagacity and prescience of one parent and the morality of  the other, yet no doubt with equal injustice. But the fact remained  that she was slight, graceful, and self-contained, and moved beside her  stumpy, commonplace father, and her faded, commonplace mother in the  dining-room of the Boomville Hotel like some distinguished alien. The  three partners, by virtue, perhaps, of their college education and  refined manners, had been exceptionally noticed by Kitty. And for some  occult reason--the more serious, perhaps, because it had no obvious  or logical presumption to the world generally--Barker was particularly  favored.    He quickened his pace, and as the flagstaff of the Boomville Hotel rose  before him in the little hollow, he seriously debated whether he had not  better go to the bank first, deposit his shares, and get a small advance  on them to buy a new necktie or a “boiled shirt” in which to present  himself to Miss Kitty; but, remembering that he had partly given his  word to Demorest that he would keep his shares intact for the present,  he abandoned this project, probably from the fact that his projected  confidence with Kitty was already a violation of Demorest's injunctions  of secrecy, and his conscience was sufficiently burdened with that  breach of faith.    But when he reached the hotel, a strange trepidation overcame him. The  dining-room was at its slack water, between the ebb of breakfast and  before the flow of the preparation for the midday meal. He could not  have his interview with Kitty in that dreary waste of reversed chairs  and bare trestlelike tables, and she was possibly engaged in her  household duties. But Miss Kitty had already seen him cross the road,  and had lounged into the dining-room with an artfully simulated air of  casually examining it. At the unexpected vision of his hopes, arrayed in  the sweetest and freshest of rosebud-sprigged print, his heart faltered.  Then, partly with the desperation of a timid man, and partly through  the working of a half-formed resolution, he met her bright smile with  a simple inquiry for her father. Miss Kitty bit her pretty lip, smiled  slightly, and preceded him with great formality to the office. Opening  the door, without raising her lashes to either her father or the  visitor, she said, with a mischievous accenting of the professional  manner, “Mr. Barker to see you on business,” and tripped sweetly away.    And this slight incident precipitated the crisis. For Barker instantly  made up his mind that he must purchase the next claim for his partners  of this man Carter, and that he would be obliged to confide to him the  details of his good fortune, and as a proof of his sincerity and his  ability to pay for it, he did so bluntly. Carter was a shrewd business  man, and the well-known simplicity of Barker was a proof of his  truthfulness, to say nothing of the shares that were shown to him. His  selling price for his claim had been two hundred dollars, but here was  a rich customer who, from a mere foolish sentiment, would be no doubt  willing to pay more. He hesitated with a bland but superior smile. “Ah,  that was my price at my last offer, Mr. Barker,” he said suavely; “but,  you see, things are going up since then.”    The keenest duplicity is apt to fail before absolute simplicity. Barker,  thoroughly believing him, and already a little frightened at his own  presumption--not for the amount of the money involved, but from the  possibility of his partners refusing his gift utterly--quickly took  advantage of this LOCUS PENITENTIAE. “No matter, then,” he said  hurriedly; “perhaps I had better consult my partners first; in fact,”   he added, with a gratuitous truthfulness all his own, “I hardly know  whether they will take it of me, so I think I'll wait.”    Carter was staggered; this would clearly not do! He recovered himself  with an insinuating smile. “You pulled me up too short, Mr. Barker;  I'm a business man, but hang it all! what's that among friends? If you  reckoned I GAVE MY WORD at two hundred--why, I'm there! Say no more  about it--the claim's yours. I'll make you out a bill of sale at once.”    “But,” hesitated Barker, “you see I haven't got the money yet, and--”    “Money!” echoed Carter bluntly, “what's that among friends? Gimme your  note at thirty days--that's good enough for ME. An' we'll settle the  whole thing now--nothing like finishing a job while you're about it.”   And before the bewildered and doubtful visitor could protest, he had  filled up a promissory note for Barker's signature and himself signed a  bill of sale for the property. “And I reckon, Mr. Barker, you'd like  to take your partners by surprise about this little gift of yours,” he  added smilingly. “Well, my messenger is starting for the Gulch in five  minutes; he's going by your cabin, and he can just drop this bill o'  sale, as a kind o' settled fact, on 'em afore they can say anything,  see! There's nothing like actin' on the spot in these sort of things.  And don't you hurry 'bout them either! You see, you sorter owe us  a friendly call--havin' always dropped inter the hotel only as a  customer--so ye'll stop here over luncheon, and I reckon, as the old  woman is busy, why Kitty will try to make the time pass till then by  playin' for you on her new pianner.”    Delighted, yet bewildered by the unexpected invitation and opportunity,  Barker mechanically signed the promissory note, and as mechanically  addressed the envelope of the bill of sale to Demorest, which Carter  gave to the messenger. Then he followed his host across the hall to the  apartment known as “Miss Kitty's parlor.” He had often heard of it as a  sanctum impervious to the ordinary guest. Whatever functions the young  girl assumed at the hotel and among her father's boarders, it was  vaguely understood that she dropped them on crossing that sacred  threshold, and became “MISS Carter.” The county judge had been  entertained there, and the wife of the bank manager. Barker's admission  there was consequently an unprecedented honor.    He cast his eyes timidly round the room, redolent and suggestive in  various charming little ways of the young girl's presence. There was  the cottage piano which had been brought up in sections on the backs of  mules from the foot of the mountain; there was a crayon head of Minerva  done by the fair occupant at the age of twelve; there was a profile  of herself done by a traveling artist; there were pretty little china  ornaments and many flowers, notably a faded but still scented woodland  shrub which Barker had presented to her two weeks ago, and over which  Miss Kitty had discreetly thrown her white handkerchief as he entered. A  wave of hope passed over him at the act, but it was quickly spent as Mr.  Carter's roughly playful voice introduced him:    “Ye kin give Mr. Barker a tune or two to pass time afore lunch, Kitty.  You kin let him see what you're doing in that line. But you'll have to  sit up now, for this young man's come inter some property, and will  be sasheying round in 'Frisco afore long with a biled shirt and a  stovepipe, and be givin' the go-by to Boomville. Well! you young folks  will excuse me for a while, as I reckon I'll just toddle over and get  the recorder to put that bill o' sale on record. Nothin' like squaring  things to onct, Mr. Barker.”    As he slipped away, Barker felt his heart sink. Carter had not only  bluntly forestalled him with the news and taken away his excuse for a  confidential interview, but had put an ostentatious construction on his  visit. What could she think of him now? He stood ashamed and embarrassed  before her.    But Miss Kitty, far from noticing his embarrassment in a sudden concern  regarding the “horrid” untidiness of the room, which made her cheeks  quite pink in one spot and obliged her to take up and set down in  exactly the same place several articles, was exceedingly delighted. In  fact, she did not remember ever having been so pleased before in her  life! These things were always so unexpected! Just like the weather, for  instance. It was quite cool last night--and now it was just stifling.  And so dusty! Had Mr. Barker noticed the heat coming from the Gulch? Or  perhaps, being a rich man, he--with a dazzling smile--was above walking  now. It was so kind of him to come here first and tell her father.    “I really wanted to tell only--YOU, Miss Carter,” stammered Barker. “You  see--” he hesitated. But Miss Kitty saw perfectly. He wanted to tell  HER, and, seeing her, he asked for HER FATHER! Not that it made the  slightest difference to her, for her father would have been sure to  have told her. It was also kind of her father to invite him to luncheon.  Otherwise she might not have seen him before he left Boomville.    But this was more than Barker could stand. With the same desperate  directness and simplicity with which he had approached her father, he  now blurted out his whole heart to her. He told her how he had loved  her hopelessly from the first time that they had spoken together at the  church picnic. Did she remember it? How he had sat and worshiped her,  and nothing else, at church! How her voice in the church choir had  sounded like an angel's; how his poverty and his uncertain future had  kept him from seeing her often, lest he should be tempted to betray his  hopeless passion. How as soon as he realized that he had a position,  that his love for her need not make her ridiculous to the world's eyes,  he came to tell her ALL. He did not even dare to hope! But she would  HEAR him at least, would she not?    Indeed, there was no getting away from his boyish, simple, outspoken  declaration. In vain Kitty smiled, frowned, glanced at her pink cheeks  in the glass, and stopped to look out of the window. The room was filled  with his love--it was encompassing her--and, despite his shy attitude,  seemed to be almost embracing her. But she managed at last to turn upon  him a face that was now as white and grave as his own was eager and  glowing.    “Sit down,” she said gently.    He did so obediently, but wonderingly. She then opened the piano and  took a seat upon the music stool before it, placed some loose sheets  of music in the rack, and ran her fingers lightly over the keys. Thus  intrenched, she let her hands fall idly in her lap, and for the first  time raised her eyes to his.    “Now listen to me--be good and don't interrupt! There!--not so near; you  can hear what I have to say well enough where you are. That will do.”    Barker had halted with the chair he was dragging toward her and sat  down.    “Now,” said Miss Kitty, withdrawing her eyes and looking straight before  her, “I believe everything you say; perhaps I oughtn't to--or at least  SAY it--but I do. There! But because I do believe you--it seems to me  all wrong! For the very reasons that you give for not having spoken to  me BEFORE, if you really felt as you say you did, are the same reasons  why you should not speak to me now. You see, all this time you have let  nobody but yourself know how you felt toward me. In everybody's eyes  YOU and your partners have been only the three stuck-up, exclusive,  college-bred men who mined a poor claim in the Gulch, and occasionally  came here to this hotel as customers. In everybody's eyes I have been  only the rich hotel-keeper's popular daughter who sometimes waited upon  you--but nothing more. But at least we were then pretty much alike,  and as good as each other. And now, as soon as you have become suddenly  rich, and, of course, the SUPERIOR, you rush down here to ask me to  acknowledge it by accepting you!”    “You know I never meant that, Miss Kitty,” burst out Barker vehemently,  but his protest was drowned in a rapid roulade from the young lady's  fingers on the keys. He sank back in his chair.    “Of course you never MEANT it,” she said with an odd laugh; “but  everybody will take it in that way, and you cannot go round to everybody  in Boomville and make the pretty declaration you have just made to me.  Everybody will say I accepted you for your money; everybody will say  it was a put-up job of my father's. Everybody will say that you threw  yourself away on me. And I don't know but that they would be right. Sit  down, please! or I shall play again.    “You see,” she went on, without looking at him, “just now you like to  remember that you fell in love with me first as a pretty waiter girl,  but if I became your wife it's just what you would like to FORGET. And  I shouldn't, for I should always like to think of the time when you came  here, whenever you could afford it and sometimes when you couldn't, just  to see me; and how we used to make excuses to speak with each other over  the dishes. You don't know what these things mean to a woman who”--she  hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly, “but what does that matter?  You would not care to be reminded of it. So,” she said, rising up with a  grave smile and grasping her hands tightly behind her, “it's a good deal  better that you should begin to forget it now. Be a good boy and take my  advice. Go to San Francisco. You will meet some girl there in a way  you will not afterward regret. You are young, and your riches, to say  nothing,” she added in a faltering voice that was somewhat inconsistent  with the mischievous smile that played upon her lips, “of your kind  and simple heart, will secure that which the world would call unselfish  affection from one more equal to you, but would always believe was only  BOUGHT if it came from me.”    “I suppose you are right,” he said simply.    She glanced quickly at him, and her eyebrows straightened. He had risen,  his face white and his gray eyes widely opened. “I suppose you are  right,” he went on, “because you are saying to me what my partners said  to me this morning, when I offered to share my wealth with them, God  knows as honestly as I offered to share my heart with you. I suppose  that you are both right; that there must be some curse of pride or  selfishness upon the money that I have got; but I have not felt it yet,  and the fault does not lie with me.”    She gave her shoulders a slight shrug, and turned impatiently toward the  window. When she turned back again he was gone. The room around her was  empty; this room, which a moment before had seemed to be pulsating with  his boyish passion, was now empty, and empty of HIM. She bit her lips,  rose, and ran eagerly to the window. She saw his straw hat and brown  curls as he crossed the road. She drew her handkerchief sharply away  from the withered shrub over which she had thrown it, and cast the once  treasured remains in the hearth. Then, possibly because she had it  ready in her hand, she clapped the handkerchief to her eyes, and sinking  sideways upon the chair he had risen from, put her elbows on its back,  and buried her face in her hands.    It is the characteristic and perhaps cruelty of a simple nature to make  no allowance for complex motives, or to even understand them! So it  seemed to Barker that his simplicity had been met with equal directness.  It was the possession of this wealth that had in some way hopelessly  changed his relations with the world. He did not love Kitty any the  less; he did not even think she had wronged him; they, his partners and  his sweetheart, were cleverer than he; there must be some occult quality  in this wealth that he would understand when he possessed it, and  perhaps it might even make him ashamed of his generosity; not in the way  they had said, but in his tempting them so audaciously to assume a wrong  position. It behoved him to take possession of it at once, and to take  also upon himself alone the knowledge, the trials, and responsibilities  it would incur. His cheeks flushed again as he thought he had tried to  tempt an innocent girl with it, and he was keenly hurt that he had not  seen in Kitty's eyes the tenderness that had softened his partners'  refusal. He resolved to wait no longer, but sell his dreadful stock at  once. He walked directly to the bank.    The manager, a shrewd but kindly man, to whom Barker was known already,  received him graciously in recognition of his well-known simple honesty,  and respectfully as a representative of the equally well-known poor but  “superior” partnership of the Gulch. He listened with marked attention  to Barker's hesitating but brief story, only remarking at its close:    “You mean, of course, the 'SECOND Extension' when you say 'First'?”    “No,” said Barker; “I mean the 'First'--and it said First in the  Boomville paper.”    “Yes, yes!--I saw it--it was a printer's error. The stock of the 'First'  was called in two years ago. No! You mean the 'Second,' for, of course,  you've followed the quotations, and are likely to know what stock you're  holding shares of. When you go back, take a look at them, and you'll see  I am right.”    “But I brought them with me,” said Barker, with a slight flushing as  he felt in his pocket, “and I am quite sure they are the 'First'.” He  brought them out and laid them on the desk before the manager.    The words “First Extension” were plainly visible. The manager glanced  curiously at Barker, and his brow darkened.    “Did anybody put this up on you?” he said sternly. “Did your partners  send you here with this stuff?”    “No! no!” said Barker eagerly. “No one! It's all MY mistake. I see it  now. I trusted to the newspaper.”    “And you mean to say you never examined the stock or the quotations, nor  followed it in any way, since you had it?”    “Never!” said Barker. “Never thought about IT AT ALL till I saw the  newspaper. So it's not worth anything?” And, to the infinite surprise of  the manager, there was a slight smile on his boyish face.    “I am afraid it is not worth the paper it's written on,” said the  manager gently.    The smile on Barker's face increased to a little laugh, in which his  wondering companion could not help joining. “Thank you,” said Barker  suddenly, and rushed away.    “He beats everything!” said the manager, gazing after him. “Damned if he  didn't seem even PLEASED.”    He WAS pleased. The burden of wealth had fallen from his shoulders; the  dreadful incubus that had weighed him down and parted his friends from  him was gone! And he had not got rid of it by spending it foolishly. It  had not ruined anybody yet; it had not altered anybody in HIS eyes.  It was gone; and he was a free and happy man once more. He would go  directly back to his partners; they would laugh at him, of course, but  they could not look at him now with the same sad, commiserating eyes.  Perhaps even Kitty--but here a sudden chill struck him. He had forgotten  the bill of sale! He had forgotten the dreadful promissory note given to  her father in the rash presumption of his wealth! How could it ever be  paid? And more than that, it had been given in a fraud. He had no money  when he gave it, and no prospect of any but what he was to get from  those worthless shares. Would anybody believe him that it was only a  stupid blunder of his own? Yes, his partners might believe him; but,  horrible thought, he had already implicated THEM in his fraud! Even now,  while he was standing there hesitatingly in the road, they were entering  upon the new claim he had NOT PAID FOR--COULD NOT PAY FOR--and in the  guise of a benefactor he was dishonoring them. Yet it was Carter he  must meet first; he must confess all to him. He must go back to the  hotel--that hotel where he had indignantly left her, and tell the father  he was a fraud. It was terrible to think of; perhaps it was part of that  money curse that he could not get rid of, and was now realizing; but  it MUST be done. He was simple, but his very simplicity had that  unhesitating directness of conclusion which is the main factor of what  men call “pluck.”    He turned back to the hotel and entered the office. But Mr. Carter had  not yet returned. What was to be done? He could not wait there; there  was no time to be lost; there was only one other person who knew his  expectations, and to whom he could confide his failure--it was Kitty. It  was to taste the dregs of his humiliation, but it must be done. He ran  up the staircase and knocked timidly at the sitting-room door. There was  a momentary pause, and a weak voice said “Come in.” Barker opened the  door; saw the vision of a handkerchief thrown away, of a pair of tearful  eyes that suddenly changed to stony indifference, and a graceful but  stiffening figure. But he was past all insult now.    “I would not intrude,” he said simply, “but I came only to see your  father. I have made an awful blunder--more than a blunder, I think--a  FRAUD. Believing that I was rich, I purchased your father's claim for my  partners, and gave him my promissory note. I came here to give him back  his claim--for that note can NEVER be paid! I have just been to the  bank; I find I have made a stupid mistake in the name of the shares upon  which I based my belief in my wealth. The ones I own are worthless--am  as poor as ever--I am even poorer, for I owe your father money I can  never pay!”    To his amazement he saw a look of pain and scorn come into her troubled  eyes which he had never seen before. “This is a feeble trick,” she said  bitterly; “it is unlike you--it is unworthy of you!”    “Good God! You must believe me. Listen! it was all a mistake--a  printer's error. I read in the paper that the stock for the First  Extension mine had gone up, when it should have been the Second. I  had some old stock of the First, which I had kept for years, and only  thought of when I read the announcement in the paper this morning. I  swear to you--”    But it was unnecessary. There was no doubting the truth of that  voice--that manner. The scorn fled from Miss Kitty's eyes to give place  to a stare, and then suddenly changed to two bubbling blue wells of  laughter. She went to the window and laughed. She sat down to the piano  and laughed. She caught up the handkerchief, and hiding half her rosy  face in it, laughed. She finally collapsed into an easy chair, and,  burying her brown head in its cushions, laughed long and confidentially  until she brought up suddenly against a sob. And then was still.    Barker was dreadfully alarmed. He had heard of hysterics before. He felt  he ought to do something. He moved toward her timidly, and gently drew  away her handkerchief. Alas! the blue wells were running over now.  He took her cold hands in his; he knelt beside her and passed his arm  around her waist. He drew her head upon his shoulder. He was not sure  that any of these things were effective until she suddenly lifted  her eyes to his with the last ray of mirth in them vanishing in a big  teardrop, put her arms round his neck, and sobbed:    “Oh, George! You blessed innocent!”    An eloquent silence was broken by a remorseful start from Barker.    “But I must go and warn my poor partners, dearest; there yet may be  time; perhaps they have not yet taken possession of your father's  claim.”    “Yes, George dear,” said the young girl, with sparkling eyes; “and tell  them to do so AT ONCE!”    “What?” gasped Barker.    “At once--do you hear?--or it may be too late! Go quick.”    “But your father--Oh, I see, dearest, you will tell him all yourself,  and spare me.”    “I shall do nothing so foolish, Georgey. Nor shall you! Don't you see  the note isn't due for a month? Stop! Have you told anybody but Paw and  me?”    “Only the bank manager.”    She ran out of the room and returned in a minute tying the most  enchanting of hats by a ribbon under her oval chin. “I'll run over and  fix him,” she said.    “Fix him?” returned Barker, aghast.    “Yes, I'll say your wicked partners have been playing a practical joke  on you, and he mustn't give you away. He'll do anything for me.”    “But my partners didn't! On the contrary--”    “Don't tell me, George,” said Miss Kitty severely. “THEY ought never to  have let you come here with that stuff. But come! You must go at once.  You must not meet Paw; you'll blurt out everything to him; I know you!  I'll tell him you could not stay to luncheon. Quick, now; go. What?  Well--there!”    Whatever it represented, the exclamation was apparently so protracted  that Miss Kitty was obliged to push her lover to the front landing  before she could disappear by the back stairs. But once in the street,  Barker no longer lingered. It was a good three miles back to the Gulch;  he might still reach it by the time his partners were taking their  noonday rest, and he resolved that although the messenger had preceded  him, they would not enter upon the new claim until the afternoon. For  Barker, in spite of his mistress's injunction, had no idea of taking  what he couldn't pay for; he would keep the claim intact until something  could be settled. For the rest, he walked on air! Kitty loved him!  The accursed wealth no longer stood between them. They were both poor  now--everything was possible.    The sun was beginning to send dwarf shadows toward the east when he  reached the Gulch. Here a new trepidation seized him. How would his  partners receive the news of his utter failure? HE was happy, for he had  gained Kitty through it. But they? For a moment it seemed to him that he  had purchased his happiness through their loss. He stopped, took off his  hat, and ran his fingers remorsefully through his damp curls.    Another thing troubled him. He had reached the crest of the Gulch, where  their old working ground was spread before him like a map. They were not  there; neither were they lying under the four pines on the ridge where  they were wont to rest at midday. He turned with some alarm to the new  claim adjoining theirs, but there was no sign of them there either. A  sudden fear that they had, after parting from him, given up the claim  in a fit of disgust and depression, and departed, now overcame him. He  clapped his hand on his head and ran in the direction of the cabin.    He had nearly reached it when the rough challenge of “Who's there?” from  the bushes halted him, and Demorest suddenly swung into the trail.  But the singular look of sternness and impatience which he was wearing  vanished as he saw Barker, and with a loud shout of “All right, it's  only Barker! Hooray!” he ran toward him. In an instant he was joined by  Stacy from the cabin, and the two men, catching hold of their returning  partner, waltzed him joyfully and breathlessly into the cabin. But the  quick-eyed Demorest suddenly let go his hold and stared at Barker's  face. “Why, Barker, old boy, what's up?”    “Everything's up,” gasped the breathless Barker. “It's all up about  these stocks. It's all a mistake; all an infernal lie of that newspaper.  I never had the right kind of shares. The ones I have are worthless  rags”; and the next instant he had blurted out his whole interview with  the bank manager.    The two partners looked at each other, and then, to Barker's infinite  perplexity, the same extraordinary convulsion that had seized Miss Kitty  fell upon them. They laughed, holding on each other's shoulders; they  laughed, clinging to Barker's struggling figure; they went out and  laughed with their backs against a tree. They laughed separately and in  different corners. And then they came up to Barker with tears in their  eyes, dropped their heads on his shoulder, and murmured exhaustedly:    “You blessed ass!”    “But,” said Stacy suddenly, “how did you manage to buy the claim?”    “Ah! that's the most awful thing, boys. I've NEVER PAID FOR IT,” groaned  Barker.    “But Carter sent us the bill of sale,” persisted Demorest, “or we  shouldn't have taken it.”    “I gave my promissory note at thirty days,” said Barker desperately,  “and where's the money to come from now? But,” he added wildly, as the  men glanced at each other--“you said 'taken it.' Good heavens! you don't  mean to say that I'm TOO late--that you've--you've touched it?”    “I reckon that's pretty much what we HAVE been doing,” drawled Demorest.    “It looks uncommonly like it,” drawled Stacy.    Barker glanced blankly from the one to the other. “Shall we pass our  young friend in to see the show?” said Demorest to Stacy.    “Yes, if he'll be perfectly quiet and not breathe on the glasses,”   returned Stacy.    They each gravely took one of Barker's hands and led him to the  corner of the cabin. There, on an old flour barrel, stood a large tin  prospecting pan, in which the partners also occasionally used to knead  their bread. A dirty towel covered it. Demorest whisked it dexterously  aside, and disclosed three large fragments of decomposed gold and  quartz. Barker started back.    “Heft it!” said Demorest grimly.    Barker could scarcely lift the pan!    “Four thousand dollars' weight if a penny!” said Stacy, in short  staccato sentences. “In a pocket! Brought it out the second stroke of  the pick! We'd been awfully blue after you left. Awfully blue, too, when  that bill of sale came, for we thought you'd been wasting your money on  US. Reckoned we oughtn't to take it, but send it straight back to you.  Messenger gone! Then Demorest reckoned as it was done it couldn't be  undone, and we ought to make just one 'prospect' on the claim, and  strike a single stroke for you. And there it is. And there's more on the  hillside.”    “But it isn't MINE! It isn't YOURS! It's Carter's. I never had the money  to pay for it--and I haven't got it now.”    “But you gave the note--and it is not due for thirty days.”    A recollection flashed upon Barker. “Yes,” he said with thoughtful  simplicity, “that's what Kitty said.”    “Oh, Kitty said so,” said both partners, gravely.    “Yes,” stammered Barker, turning away with a heightened color, “and, as I  didn't stay there to luncheon, I think I'd better be getting it ready.”   He picked up the coffeepot and turned to the hearth as his two partners  stepped beyond the door.    “Wasn't it exactly like him?” said Demorest.    “Him all over,” said Stacy.    “And his worry over that note?” said Demorest.    “And 'what Kitty said,'” said Stacy.    “Look here! I reckon that wasn't ALL that Kitty said.”    “Of course not.”    “What luck!”          A YELLOW DOG      I never knew why in the Western States of America a yellow dog should be  proverbially considered the acme of canine degradation and incompetency,  nor why the possession of one should seriously affect the social  standing of its possessor. But the fact being established, I think we  accepted it at Rattlers Ridge without question. The matter of ownership  was more difficult to settle; and although the dog I have in my mind at  the present writing attached himself impartially and equally to everyone  in camp, no one ventured to exclusively claim him; while, after the  perpetration of any canine atrocity, everybody repudiated him with  indecent haste.    “Well, I can swear he hasn't been near our shanty for weeks,” or the  retort, “He was last seen comin' out of YOUR cabin,” expressed  the eagerness with which Rattlers Ridge washed its hands of any  responsibility. Yet he was by no means a common dog, nor even an  unhandsome dog; and it was a singular fact that his severest critics  vied with each other in narrating instances of his sagacity, insight,  and agility which they themselves had witnessed.    He had been seen crossing the “flume” that spanned Grizzly Canyon at a  height of nine hundred feet, on a plank six inches wide. He had tumbled  down the “shoot” to the South Fork, a thousand feet below, and was found  sitting on the riverbank “without a scratch, 'cept that he was lazily  givin' himself with his off hind paw.” He had been forgotten in a  snowdrift on a Sierran shelf, and had come home in the early spring with  the conceited complacency of an Alpine traveler and a plumpness alleged  to have been the result of an exclusive diet of buried mail bags and  their contents. He was generally believed to read the advance election  posters, and disappear a day or two before the candidates and the brass  band--which he hated--came to the Ridge. He was suspected of having  overlooked Colonel Johnson's hand at poker, and of having conveyed to  the Colonel's adversary, by a succession of barks, the danger of betting  against four kings.    While these statements were supplied by wholly unsupported witnesses, it  was a very human weakness of Rattlers Ridge that the responsibility of  corroboration was passed to the dog himself, and HE was looked upon as a  consummate liar.    “Snoopin' round yere, and CALLIN' yourself a poker sharp, are ye! Scoot,  you yaller pizin!” was a common adjuration whenever the unfortunate  animal intruded upon a card party. “Ef thar was a spark, an ATOM of  truth in THAT DOG, I'd believe my own eyes that I saw him sittin' up and  trying to magnetize a jay bird off a tree. But wot are ye goin' to do  with a yaller equivocator like that?”    I have said that he was yellow--or, to use the ordinary expression,  “yaller.” Indeed, I am inclined to believe that much of the ignominy  attached to the epithet lay in this favorite pronunciation. Men who  habitually spoke of a “YELLOW bird,” a “YELLOW-hammer,” a “YELLOW leaf,”   always alluded to him as a “YALLER dog.”    He certainly WAS yellow. After a bath--usually compulsory--he presented  a decided gamboge streak down his back, from the top of his forehead to  the stump of his tail, fading in his sides and flank to a delicate straw  color. His breast, legs, and feet--when not reddened by “slumgullion,”   in which he was fond of wading--were white. A few attempts at ornamental  decoration from the India-ink pot of the storekeeper failed, partly  through the yellow dog's excessive agility, which would never give the  paint time to dry on him, and partly through his success in transferring  his markings to the trousers and blankets of the camp.    The size and shape of his tail--which had been cut off before his  introduction to Rattlers Ridge--were favorite sources of speculation to  the miners, as determining both his breed and his moral responsibility  in coming into camp in that defective condition. There was a general  opinion that he couldn't have looked worse with a tail, and its removal  was therefore a gratuitous effrontery.    His best feature was his eyes, which were a lustrous Vandyke brown, and  sparkling with intelligence; but here again he suffered from evolution  through environment, and their original trustful openness was marred by  the experience of watching for flying stones, sods, and passing kicks  from the rear, so that the pupils were continually reverting to the  outer angle of the eyelid.    Nevertheless, none of these characteristics decided the vexed question  of his BREED. His speed and scent pointed to a “hound,” and it is  related that on one occasion he was laid on the trail of a wildcat with  such success that he followed it apparently out of the State, returning  at the end of two weeks footsore, but blandly contented.    Attaching himself to a prospecting party, he was sent under the same  belief, “into the brush” to drive off a bear, who was supposed to be  haunting the campfire. He returned in a few minutes WITH the bear,  DRIVING IT INTO the unarmed circle and scattering the whole party. After  this the theory of his being a hunting dog was abandoned. Yet it was  said--on the usual uncorroborated evidence--that he had “put up” a  quail; and his qualities as a retriever were for a long time accepted,  until, during a shooting expedition for wild ducks, it was discovered  that the one he had brought back had never been shot, and the party were  obliged to compound damages with an adjacent settler.    His fondness for paddling in the ditches and “slumgullion” at one time  suggested a water spaniel. He could swim, and would occasionally bring  out of the river sticks and pieces of bark that had been thrown in; but  as HE always had to be thrown in with them, and was a good-sized dog,  his aquatic reputation faded also. He remained simply “a yaller dog.”   What more could be said? His actual name was “Bones”--given to him, no  doubt, through the provincial custom of confounding the occupation of  the individual with his quality, for which it was pointed out precedent  could be found in some old English family names.    But if Bones generally exhibited no preference for any particular  individual in camp, he always made an exception in favor of drunkards.  Even an ordinary roistering bacchanalian party brought him out from  under a tree or a shed in the keenest satisfaction. He would accompany  them through the long straggling street of the settlement, barking his  delight at every step or misstep of the revelers, and exhibiting none of  that mistrust of eye which marked his attendance upon the sane and the  respectable. He accepted even their uncouth play without a snarl or a  yelp, hypocritically pretending even to like it; and I conscientiously  believe would have allowed a tin can to be attached to his tail if the  hand that tied it on were only unsteady, and the voice that bade him  “lie still” were husky with liquor. He would “see” the party cheerfully  into a saloon, wait outside the door--his tongue fairly lolling from his  mouth in enjoyment--until they reappeared, permit them even to tumble  over him with pleasure, and then gambol away before them, heedless of  awkwardly projected stones and epithets. He would afterward accompany  them separately home, or lie with them at crossroads until they were  assisted to their cabins. Then he would trot rakishly to his own haunt  by the saloon stove, with the slightly conscious air of having been a  bad dog, yet of having had a good time.    We never could satisfy ourselves whether his enjoyment arose from some  merely selfish conviction that he was more SECURE with the physically  and mentally incompetent, from some active sympathy with active  wickedness, or from a grim sense of his own mental superiority at such  moments. But the general belief leant toward his kindred sympathy as a  “yaller dog” with all that was disreputable. And this was supported by  another very singular canine manifestation--the “sincere flattery” of  simulation or imitation.    “Uncle Billy” Riley for a short time enjoyed the position of being  the camp drunkard, and at once became an object of Bones' greatest  solicitude. He not only accompanied him everywhere, curled at his feet  or head according to Uncle Billy's attitude at the moment, but, it was  noticed, began presently to undergo a singular alteration in his own  habits and appearance. From being an active, tireless scout and forager,  a bold and unovertakable marauder, he became lazy and apathetic;  allowed gophers to burrow under him without endeavoring to undermine the  settlement in his frantic endeavors to dig them out, permitted squirrels  to flash their tails at him a hundred yards away, forgot his usual  caches, and left his favorite bones unburied and bleaching in the sun.  His eyes grew dull, his coat lusterless, in proportion as his companion  became blear-eyed and ragged; in running, his usual arrowlike directness  began to deviate, and it was not unusual to meet the pair together,  zigzagging up the hill. Indeed, Uncle Billy's condition could be  predetermined by Bones' appearance at times when his temporary master  was invisible. “The old man must have an awful jag on today,” was  casually remarked when an extra fluffiness and imbecility was noticeable  in the passing Bones. At first it was believed that he drank also, but  when careful investigation proved this hypothesis untenable, he was  freely called a “derned time-servin', yaller hypocrite.” Not a few  advanced the opinion that if Bones did not actually lead Uncle Billy  astray, he at least “slavered him over and coddled him until the old man  got conceited in his wickedness.” This undoubtedly led to a compulsory  divorce between them, and Uncle Billy was happily dispatched to a  neighboring town and a doctor.    Bones seemed to miss him greatly, ran away for two days, and was  supposed to have visited him, to have been shocked at his convalescence,  and to have been “cut” by Uncle Billy in his reformed character; and  he returned to his old active life again, and buried his past with his  forgotten bones. It was said that he was afterward detected in trying  to lead an intoxicated tramp into camp after the methods employed by  a blind man's dog, but was discovered in time by the--of  course--uncorroborated narrator.    I should be tempted to leave him thus in his original and picturesque  sin, but the same veracity which compelled me to transcribe his  faults and iniquities obliges me to describe his ultimate and somewhat  monotonous reformation, which came from no fault of his own.    It was a joyous day at Rattlers Ridge that was equally the advent of  his change of heart and the first stagecoach that had been induced to  diverge from the highroad and stop regularly at our settlement. Flags  were flying from the post office and Polka saloon, and Bones was flying  before the brass band that he detested, when the sweetest girl in the  county--Pinkey Preston--daughter of the county judge and hopelessly  beloved by all Rattlers Ridge, stepped from the coach which she had  glorified by occupying as an invited guest.    “What makes him run away?” she asked quickly, opening her lovely eyes in  a possibly innocent wonder that anything could be found to run away from  her.    “He don't like the brass band,” we explained eagerly.    “How funny,” murmured the girl; “is it as out of tune as all that?”    This irresistible witticism alone would have been enough to satisfy  us--we did nothing but repeat it to each other all the next day--but we  were positively transported when we saw her suddenly gather her dainty  skirts in one hand and trip off through the red dust toward Bones, who,  with his eyes over his yellow shoulder, had halted in the road,  and half-turned in mingled disgust and rage at the spectacle of the  descending trombone. We held our breath as she approached him. Would  Bones evade her as he did us at such moments, or would he save our  reputation, and consent, for the moment, to accept her as a new kind of  inebriate? She came nearer; he saw her; he began to slowly quiver with  excitement--his stump of a tail vibrating with such rapidity that  the loss of the missing portion was scarcely noticeable. Suddenly she  stopped before him, took his yellow head between her little hands,  lifted it, and looked down in his handsome brown eyes with her two  lovely blue ones. What passed between them in that magnetic glance no  one ever knew. She returned with him; said to him casually: “We're not  afraid of brass bands, are we?” to which he apparently acquiesced, at  least stifling his disgust of them while he was near her--which was  nearly all the time.    During the speechmaking her gloved hand and his yellow head were always  near together, and at the crowning ceremony--her public checking of Yuba  Bill's “waybill” on behalf of the township, with a gold pencil presented  to her by the Stage Company--Bones' joy, far from knowing no bounds,  seemed to know nothing but them, and he witnessed it apparently in the  air. No one dared to interfere. For the first time a local pride in  Bones sprang up in our hearts--and we lied to each other in his praises  openly and shamelessly.    Then the time came for parting. We were standing by the door of the  coach, hats in hand, as Miss Pinkey was about to step into it; Bones  was waiting by her side, confidently looking into the interior, and  apparently selecting his own seat on the lap of Judge Preston in the  corner, when Miss Pinkey held up the sweetest of admonitory fingers.  Then, taking his head between her two hands, she again looked into  his brimming eyes, and said, simply, “GOOD dog,” with the gentlest of  emphasis on the adjective, and popped into the coach.    The six bay horses started as one, the gorgeous green and gold vehicle  bounded forward, the red dust rose behind, and the yellow dog danced  in and out of it to the very outskirts of the settlement. And then he  soberly returned.    A day or two later he was missed--but the fact was afterward known that  he was at Spring Valley, the county town where Miss Preston lived, and  he was forgiven. A week afterward he was missed again, but this time for  a longer period, and then a pathetic letter arrived from Sacramento for  the storekeeper's wife.    “Would you mind,” wrote Miss Pinkey Preston, “asking some of your boys  to come over here to Sacramento and bring back Bones? I don't mind  having the dear dog walk out with me at Spring Valley, where everyone  knows me; but here he DOES make one so noticeable, on account of HIS  COLOR. I've got scarcely a frock that he agrees with. He don't go with  my pink muslin, and that lovely buff tint he makes three shades lighter.  You know yellow is SO trying.”    A consultation was quickly held by the whole settlement, and a  deputation sent to Sacramento to relieve the unfortunate girl. We  were all quite indignant with Bones--but, oddly enough, I think it was  greatly tempered with our new pride in him. While he was with us alone,  his peculiarities had been scarcely appreciated, but the recurrent  phrase “that yellow dog that they keep at the Rattlers” gave us a  mysterious importance along the countryside, as if we had secured a  “mascot” in some zoological curiosity.    This was further indicated by a singular occurrence. A new church had  been built at the crossroads, and an eminent divine had come from San  Francisco to preach the opening sermon. After a careful examination of  the camp's wardrobe, and some felicitous exchange of apparel, a few of  us were deputed to represent “Rattlers” at the Sunday service. In our  white ducks, straw hats, and flannel blouses, we were sufficiently  picturesque and distinctive as “honest miners” to be shown off in one of  the front pews.    Seated near the prettiest girls, who offered us their hymn books--in the  cleanly odor of fresh pine shavings, and ironed muslin, and blown over  by the spices of our own woods through the open windows, a deep sense  of the abiding peace of Christian communion settled upon us. At this  supreme moment someone murmured in an awe-stricken whisper:    “WILL you look at Bones?”    We looked. Bones had entered the church and gone up in the gallery  through a pardonable ignorance and modesty; but, perceiving his mistake,  was now calmly walking along the gallery rail before the astounded  worshipers. Reaching the end, he paused for a moment, and carelessly  looked down. It was about fifteen feet to the floor below--the simplest  jump in the world for the mountain-bred Bones. Daintily, gingerly,  lazily, and yet with a conceited airiness of manner, as if, humanly  speaking, he had one leg in his pocket and were doing it on three, he  cleared the distance, dropping just in front of the chancel, without a  sound, turned himself around three times, and then lay comfortably down.    Three deacons were instantly in the aisle, coming up before the eminent  divine, who, we fancied, wore a restrained smile. We heard the hurried  whispers: “Belongs to them.” “Quite a local institution here, you know.”   “Don't like to offend sensibilities;” and the minister's prompt “By no  means,” as he went on with his service.    A short month ago we would have repudiated Bones; today we sat there  in slightly supercilious attitudes, as if to indicate that any affront  offered to Bones would be an insult to ourselves, and followed by our  instantaneous withdrawal in a body.    All went well, however, until the minister, lifting the large Bible  from the communion table and holding it in both hands before him, walked  toward a reading stand by the altar rails. Bones uttered a distinct  growl. The minister stopped.    We, and we alone, comprehended in a flash the whole situation. The Bible  was nearly the size and shape of one of those soft clods of sod which we  were in the playful habit of launching at Bones when he lay half-asleep  in the sun, in order to see him cleverly evade it.    We held our breath. What was to be done? But the opportunity belonged  to our leader, Jeff Briggs--a confoundedly good-looking fellow, with the  golden mustache of a northern viking and the curls of an Apollo. Secure  in his beauty and bland in his self-conceit, he rose from the pew, and  stepped before the chancel rails.    “I would wait a moment, if I were you, sir,” he said, respectfully, “and  you will see that he will go out quietly.”    “What is wrong?” whispered the minister in some concern.    “He thinks you are going to heave that book at him, sir, without giving  him a fair show, as we do.”    The minister looked perplexed, but remained motionless, with the book in  his hands. Bones arose, walked halfway down the aisle, and vanished like  a yellow flash!    With this justification of his reputation, Bones disappeared for a week.  At the end of that time we received a polite note from Judge Preston,  saying that the dog had become quite domiciled in their house, and  begged that the camp, without yielding up their valuable PROPERTY in  him, would allow him to remain at Spring Valley for an indefinite time;  that both the judge and his daughter--with whom Bones was already an old  friend--would be glad if the members of the camp would visit their old  favorite whenever they desired, to assure themselves that he was well  cared for.    I am afraid that the bait thus ingenuously thrown out had a good deal to  do with our ultimate yielding. However, the reports of those who visited  Bones were wonderful and marvelous. He was residing there in state,  lying on rugs in the drawing-room, coiled up under the judicial desk in  the judge's study, sleeping regularly on the mat outside Miss Pinkey's  bedroom door, or lazily snapping at flies on the judge's lawn.    “He's as yaller as ever,” said one of our informants, “but it don't  somehow seem to be the same back that we used to break clods over in the  old time, just to see him scoot out of the dust.”    And now I must record a fact which I am aware all lovers of dogs will  indignantly deny, and which will be furiously bayed at by every faithful  hound since the days of Ulysses. Bones not only FORGOT, but absolutely  CUT US! Those who called upon the judge in “store clothes” he would  perhaps casually notice, but he would sniff at them as if detecting and  resenting them under their superficial exterior. The rest he simply paid  no attention to. The more familiar term of “Bonesy”--formerly applied  to him, as in our rare moments of endearment--produced no response.  This pained, I think, some of the more youthful of us; but, through some  strange human weakness, it also increased the camp's respect for him.  Nevertheless, we spoke of him familiarly to strangers at the very moment  he ignored us. I am afraid that we also took some pains to point  out that he was getting fat and unwieldy, and losing his elasticity,  implying covertly that his choice was a mistake and his life a failure.    A year after, he died, in the odor of sanctity and respectability, being  found one morning coiled up and stiff on the mat outside Miss Pinkey's  door. When the news was conveyed to us, we asked permission, the camp  being in a prosperous condition, to erect a stone over his grave. But  when it came to the inscription we could only think of the two words  murmured to him by Miss Pinkey, which we always believe effected his  conversion:    “GOOD Dog!”          A MOTHER OF FIVE      She was a mother--and a rather exemplary one--of five children, although  her own age was barely nine. Two of these children were twins, and she  generally alluded to them as “Mr. Amplach's children,” referring to an  exceedingly respectable gentleman in the next settlement who, I have  reason to believe, had never set eyes on her or them. The twins were  quite naturally alike--having been in a previous state of existence two  ninepins--and were still somewhat vague and inchoate below their low  shoulders in their long clothes, but were also firm and globular about  the head, and there were not wanting those who professed to see in this  an unmistakable resemblance to their reputed father. The other children  were dolls of different ages, sex, and condition, but the twins may  be said to have been distinctly her own conception. Yet such was her  admirable and impartial maternity that she never made any difference  between them. “The Amplach's children” was a description rather than a  distinction.    She was herself the motherless child of Robert Foulkes, a hardworking  but somewhat improvident teamster on the Express Route between Big Bend  and Reno. His daily avocation, when she was not actually with him in the  wagon, led to an occasional dispersion of herself and her progeny along  the road and at wayside stations between those places. But the family  was generally collected together by rough but kindly hands already  familiar with the handling of her children. I have a very vivid  recollection of Jim Carter trampling into a saloon, after a five-mile  walk through a snowdrift, with an Amplach twin in his pocket. “Suthin'  ought to be done,” he growled, “to make Meary a little more careful o'  them Amplach children; I picked up one outer the snow a mile beyond Big  Bend.” “God bless my soul!” said a casual passenger, looking up hastily;  “I didn't know Mr. Amplach was married.” Jim winked diabolically at us  over his glass. “No more did I,” he responded gloomily, “but you can't  tell anything about the ways o' them respectable, psalm-singing jay  birds.” Having thus disposed of Amplach's character, later on, when  he was alone with Mary, or “Meary,” as she chose to pronounce it, the  rascal worked upon her feelings with an account of the infant Amplach's  sufferings in the snowdrift and its agonized whisperings for “Meary!  Meary!” until real tears stood in Mary's blue eyes. “Let this be a  lesson to you,” he concluded, drawing the ninepin dexterously from his  pocket, “for it took nigh a quart of the best forty-rod whisky to bring  that child to.” Not only did Mary firmly believe him, but for weeks  afterwards “Julian Amplach”--this unhappy twin--was kept in a somnolent  attitude in the cart, and was believed to have contracted dissipated  habits from the effects of his heroic treatment.    Her numerous family was achieved in only two years, and succeeded her  first child, which was brought from Sacramento at considerable expense  by a Mr. William Dodd, also a teamster, on her seventh birthday. This,  by one of those rare inventions known only to a child's vocabulary,  she at once called “Misery”--probably a combination of “Missy,” as she  herself was formerly termed by strangers, and “Missouri,” her native  State. It was an excessively large doll at first--Mr. Dodd wishing to  get the worth of his money--but time, and perhaps an excess of maternal  care, remedied the defect, and it lost flesh and certain unemployed  parts of its limbs very rapidly. It was further reduced in bulk by  falling under the wagon and having the whole train pass over it,  but singularly enough its greatest attenuation was in the head and  shoulders--the complexion peeling off as a solid layer, followed by the  disappearance of distinct strata of its extraordinary composition. This  continued until the head and shoulders were much too small for even  its reduced frame, and all the devices of childish millinery--a shawl  secured with tacks and well hammered in, and a hat which tilted backward  and forward and never appeared at the same angle--failed to restore  symmetry. Until one dreadful morning, after an imprudent bath, the whole  upper structure disappeared, leaving two hideous iron prongs standing  erect from the spinal column. Even an imaginative child like Mary could  not accept this sort of thing as a head. Later in the day Jack Roper,  the blacksmith at the “Crossing,” was concerned at the plaintive  appearance before his forge of a little girl clad in a bright-blue  pinafore of the same color as her eyes, carrying her monstrous offspring  in her arms. Jack recognized her and instantly divined the situation.  “You haven't,” he suggested kindly, “got another head at home--suthin'  left over,” Mary shook her head sadly; even her prolific maternity was  not equal to the creation of children in detail. “Nor anythin' like  a head?” he persisted sympathetically. Mary's loving eyes filled with  tears. “No, nuffen!” “You couldn't,” he continued thoughtfully, “use her  the other side up?--we might get a fine pair o' legs outer them irons,”   he added, touching the two prongs with artistic suggestion. “Now look  here”--he was about to tilt the doll over when a small cry of feminine  distress and a swift movement of a matronly little arm arrested the  evident indiscretion. “I see,” he said gravely. “Well, you come here  tomorrow, and we'll fix up suthin' to work her.” Jack was thoughtful the  rest of the day, more than usually impatient with certain stubborn mules  to be shod, and even knocked off work an hour earlier to walk to Big  Bend and a rival shop. But the next morning when the trustful and  anxious mother appeared at the forge she uttered a scream of delight.  Jack had neatly joined a hollow iron globe, taken from the newel post of  some old iron staircase railing, to the two prongs, and covered it  with a coat of red fireproof paint. It was true that its complexion was  rather high, that it was inclined to be top-heavy, and that in the long  run the other dolls suffered considerably by enforced association with  this unyielding and implacable head and shoulders, but this did not  diminish Mary's joy over her restored first-born. Even its utter absence  of features was no defect in a family where features were as evanescent  as in hers, and the most ordinary student of evolution could see  that the “Amplach” ninepins were in legitimate succession to the  globular-headed “Misery.” For a time I think that Mary even preferred  her to the others. Howbeit it was a pretty sight to see her on a summer  afternoon sitting upon a wayside stump, her other children dutifully  ranged around her, and the hard, unfeeling head of Misery pressed deep  down into her loving little heart as she swayed from side to side,  crooning her plaintive lullaby. Small wonder that the bees took up the  song and droned a slumberous accompaniment, or that high above her head  the enormous pines, stirred through their depths by the soft Sierran  air--or Heaven knows what--let slip flickering lights and shadows to  play over that cast-iron face, until the child, looking down upon it  with the quick, transforming power of love, thought that it smiled.    The two remaining members of the family were less distinctive.  “Gloriana”--pronounced as two words: “Glory Anna”--being the work of  her father, who also named it, was simply a cylindrical roll of canvas  wagon-covering, girt so as to define a neck and waist, with a rudely  inked face--altogether a weak, pitiable, manlike invention; and “Johnny  Dear,” alleged to be the representative of John Doremus, a young  storekeeper who occasionally supplied Mary with gratuitous sweets. Mary  never admitted this, and as we were all gentlemen along that road,  we were blind to the suggestion. “Johnny Dear” was originally a small  plaster phrenological cast of a head and bust, begged from some shop  window in the county town, with a body clearly constructed by Mary  herself. It was an ominous fact that it was always dressed as a BOY,  and was distinctly the most HUMAN-looking of all her progeny. Indeed,  in spite of the faculties that were legibly printed all over its smooth,  white, hairless head, it was appallingly lifelike. Left sometimes by  Mary astride of the branch of a wayside tree, horsemen had been known to  dismount hurriedly and examine it, returning with a mystified smile, and  it was on record that Yuba Bill had once pulled up the Pioneer Coach  at the request of curious and imploring passengers, and then grimly  installed “Johnny Dear” beside him on the box seat, publicly delivering  him to Mary at Big Bend, to her wide-eyed confusion and the first blush  we had ever seen on her round, chubby, sunburnt cheeks. It may seem  strange that with her great popularity and her well-known maternal  instincts, she had not been kept fully supplied with proper and more  conventional dolls; but it was soon recognized that she did not care  for them--left their waxen faces, rolling eyes, and abundant hair in  ditches, or stripped them to help clothe the more extravagant creatures  of her fancy. So it came that “Johnny Dear's” strictly classical profile  looked out from under a girl's fashionable straw sailor hat, to the  utter obliteration of his prominent intellectual faculties; the Amplach  twins wore bonnets on their ninepins heads, and even an attempt was  made to fit a flaxen scalp on the iron-headed Misery. But her dolls were  always a creation of her own--her affection for them increasing with the  demand upon her imagination. This may seem somewhat inconsistent  with her habit of occasionally abandoning them in the woods or in the  ditches. But she had an unbounded confidence in the kindly maternity of  Nature, and trusted her children to the breast of the Great Mother as  freely as she did herself in her own motherlessness. And this confidence  was rarely betrayed. Rats, mice, snails, wildcats, panther, and bear  never touched her lost waifs. Even the elements were kindly; an Amplach  twin buried under a snowdrift in high altitudes reappeared smilingly  in the spring in all its wooden and painted integrity. We were all  Pantheists then--and believed this implicitly. It was only when exposed  to the milder forces of civilization that Mary had anything to fear.  Yet even then, when Patsy O'Connor's domestic goat had once tried to  “sample” the lost Misery, he had retreated with the loss of three  front teeth, and Thompson's mule came out of an encounter with that  iron-headed prodigy with a sprained hind leg and a cut and swollen  pastern.    But these were the simple Arcadian days of the road between Big Bend and  Reno, and progress and prosperity, alas! brought changes in their wake.  It was already whispered that Mary ought to be going to school, and  Mr. Amplach--still happily oblivious of the liberties taken with his  name--as trustee of the public school at Duckville, had intimated that  Mary's bohemian wanderings were a scandal to the county. She was growing  up in ignorance, a dreadful ignorance of everything but the chivalry,  the deep tenderness, the delicacy and unselfishness of the rude men  around her, and obliviousness of faith in anything but the immeasurable  bounty of Nature toward her and her children. Of course there was a  fierce discussion between “the boys” of the road and the few married  families of the settlement on this point, but, of course, progress and  “snivelization”--as the boys chose to call it--triumphed. The projection  of a railroad settled it; Robert Foulkes, promoted to a foremanship of  a division of the line, was made to understand that his daughter must be  educated. But the terrible question of Mary's family remained. No school  would open its doors to that heterogeneous collection, and Mary's little  heart would have broken over the rude dispersal or heroic burning of her  children. The ingenuity of Jack Roper suggested a compromise. She  was allowed to select one to take to school with her; the others were  ADOPTED by certain of her friends, and she was to be permitted to visit  them every Saturday afternoon. The selection was a cruel trial, so cruel  that, knowing her undoubted preference for her firstborn, Misery, we  would not have interfered for worlds, but in her unexpected choice  of “Johnny Dear” the most unworldly of us knew that it was the first  glimmering of feminine tact--her first submission to the world of  propriety that she was now entering. “Johnny Dear” was undoubtedly the  most presentable; even more, there was an educational suggestion in its  prominent, mapped-out phrenological organs. The adopted fathers were  loyal to their trust. Indeed, for years afterward the blacksmith kept  the iron-headed Misery on a rude shelf, like a shrine, near his bunk;  nobody but himself and Mary ever knew the secret, stolen, and thrilling  interviews that took place during the first days of their separation.  Certain facts, however, transpired concerning Mary's equal faithfulness  to another of her children. It is said that one Saturday afternoon, when  the road manager of the new line was seated in his office at Reno in  private business discussion with two directors, a gentle tap was heard  at the door. It was opened to an eager little face, a pair of blue eyes,  and a blue pinafore. To the astonishment of the directors, a change came  over the face of the manager. Taking the child gently by the hand, he  walked to his desk, on which the papers of the new line were  scattered, and drew open a drawer from which he took a large ninepin  extraordinarily dressed as a doll. The astonishment of the two gentlemen  was increased at the following quaint colloquy between the manager and  the child.    “She's doing remarkably well in spite of the trying weather, but I have  had to keep her very quiet,” said the manager, regarding the ninepin  critically.    “Ess,” said Mary quickly, “It's just the same with Johnny Dear; his  cough is f'ightful at nights. But Misery's all right. I've just been to  see her.”    “There's a good deal of scarlet fever around,” continued the manager  with quiet concern, “and we can't be too careful. But I shall take her  for a little run down the line tomorrow.”    The eyes of Mary sparkled and overflowed like blue water. Then there was  a kiss, a little laugh, a shy glance at the two curious strangers, the  blue pinafore fluttered away, and the colloquy ended. She was equally  attentive in her care of the others, but the rag baby “Gloriana,” who  had found a home in Jim Carter's cabin at the Ridge, living too far for  daily visits, was brought down regularly on Saturday afternoon to Mary's  house by Jim, tucked in asleep in his saddle bags or riding gallantly  before him on the horn of his saddle. On Sunday there was a dress  parade of all the dolls, which kept Mary in heart for the next week's  desolation.    But there came one Saturday and Sunday when Mary did not appear, and it  was known along the road that she had been called to San Francisco to  meet an aunt who had just arrived from “the States.” It was a vacant  Sunday to “the boys,” a very hollow, unsanctified Sunday, somehow,  without that little figure. But the next, Sunday, and the next, were  still worse, and then it was known that the dreadful aunt was making  much of Mary, and was sending her to a grand school--a convent at Santa  Clara--where it was rumored girls were turned out so accomplished that  their own parents did not know them. But WE knew that was impossible to  our Mary; and a letter which came from her at the end of the month, and  before the convent had closed upon the blue pinafore, satisfied us, and  was balm to our anxious hearts. It was characteristic of Mary; it was  addressed to nobody in particular, and would--but for the prudence of  the aunt--have been entrusted to the post office open and undirected. It  was a single sheet, handed to us without a word by her father; but as  we passed it from hand to hand, we understood it as if we had heard our  lost playfellow's voice.    “Ther's more houses in 'Frisco than you kin shake a stick at and  wimmens till you kant rest, but mules and jakasses ain't got no sho, nor  blacksmiffs shops, wich is not to be seen no wear. Rapits and Skwirls  also bares and panfers is on-noun and unforgotten on account of the  streets and Sunday skoles. Jim Roper you orter be very good to Mizzery  on a kount of my not bein' here, and not harten your hart to her bekos  she is top heavy--which is ontroo and simply an imptient lie--like  you allus make. I have a kinary bird wot sings deliteful--but isn't a  yellerhamer sutch as I know, as you'd think. Dear Mister Montgommery,  don't keep Gulan Amplak to mutch shet up in office drors; it isn't good  for his lungs and chest. And don't you ink his head--nother! youre as  bad as the rest. Johnny Dear, you must be very kind to your attopted  father, and you, Glory Anna, must lov your kind Jimmy Carter verry  mutch for taking you hossback so offen. I has been buggy ridin' with  an orficer who has killed injuns real! I am comin' back soon with grate  affeckshun, so luke out and mind.”    But it was three years before she returned, and this was her last  and only letter. The “adopted fathers” of her children were faithful,  however, and when the new line was opened, and it was understood that  she was to be present with her father at the ceremony, they came, with  a common understanding, to the station to meet their old playmate. They  were ranged along the platform--poor Jack Roper a little overweighted  with a bundle he was carrying on his left arm. And then a young girl  in the freshness of her teens and the spotless purity of a muslin frock  that although brief in skirt was perfect in fit, faultlessly booted and  gloved, tripped from the train, and offered a delicate hand in turn to  each of her old friends. Nothing could be prettier than the smile on the  cheeks that were no longer sunburnt; nothing could be clearer than the  blue eyes lifted frankly to theirs. And yet, as she gracefully turned  away with her father, the faces of the four adopted parents were found  to be as red and embarrassed as her own on the day that Yuba Bill drove  up publicly with “Johnny Dear” on the box seat.    “You weren't such a fool,” said Jack Montgomery to Roper, “as to bring  Misery here with you?”    “I was,” said Roper with a constrained laugh--“and you?” He had just  caught sight of the head of a ninepin peeping from the manager's pocket.  The man laughed, and then the four turned silently away.    “Mary” had indeed come back to them; but not “The Mother of Five!”          BULGER'S REPUTATION      We all remembered very distinctly Bulger's advent in Rattlesnake Camp.  It was during the rainy season--a season singularly inducive to settled  reflective impressions as we sat and smoked around the stove in Mosby's  grocery. Like older and more civilized communities, we had our periodic  waves of sentiment and opinion, with the exception that they were more  evanescent with us, and as we had just passed through a fortnight of  dissipation and extravagance, owing to a visit from some gamblers and  speculators, we were now undergoing a severe moral revulsion, partly  induced by reduced finances and partly by the arrival of two families  with grownup daughters on the hill. It was raining, with occasional warm  breaths, through the open window, of the southwest trades, redolent of  the saturated spices of the woods and springing grasses, which perhaps  were slightly inconsistent with the hot stove around which we had  congregated. But the stove was only an excuse for our listless,  gregarious gathering; warmth and idleness went well together, and it was  currently accepted that we had caught from the particular reptile which  gave its name to our camp much of its pathetic, lifelong search for  warmth, and its habit of indolently basking in it.    A few of us still went through the affectation of attempting to dry our  damp clothes by the stove, and sizzling our wet boots against it; but  as the same individuals calmly permitted the rain to drive in upon them  through the open window without moving, and seemed to take infinite  delight in the amount of steam they generated, even that pretense  dropped. Crotalus himself, with his tail in a muddy ditch, and the sun  striking cold fire from his slit eyes as he basked his head on a warm  stone beside it, could not have typified us better.    Percy Briggs took his pipe from his mouth at last and said, with  reflective severity:    “Well, gentlemen, if we can't get the wagon road over here, and if  we're going to be left out by the stagecoach company, we can at least  straighten up the camp, and not have it look like a cross between a  tenement alley and a broken-down circus. I declare, I was just sick  when these two Baker girls started to make a short cut through the camp.  Darned if they didn't turn round and take to the woods and the rattlers  again afore they got halfway. And that benighted idiot, Tom Rollins,  standin' there in the ditch, spattered all over with slumgullion 'til he  looked like a spotted tarrypin, wavin' his fins and sashaying backwards  and forrards and sayin', 'This way, ladies; this way!'”    “I didn't,” returned Tom Rollins, quite casually, without looking up  from his steaming boots; “I didn't start in night afore last to dance  'The Green Corn Dance' outer 'Hiawatha,' with feathers in my hair and  a red blanket on my shoulders, round that family's new potato patch,  in order that it might 'increase and multiply.' I didn't sing 'Sabbath  Morning Bells' with an anvil accompaniment until twelve o'clock at  night over at the Crossing, so that they might dream of their Happy  Childhood's Home. It seems to me that it wasn't me did it. I might be  mistaken--it was late--but I have the impression that it wasn't me.”    From the silence that followed, this would seem to have been clearly  a recent performance of the previous speaker, who, however, responded  quite cheerfully:    “An evenin' o' simple, childish gaiety don't count. We've got to start  in again FAIR. What we want here is to clear up and encourage decent  immigration, and get rid o' gamblers and blatherskites that are makin'  this yer camp their happy hunting-ground. We don't want any more  permiskus shootin'. We don't want any more paintin' the town red. We  don't want any more swaggerin' galoots ridin' up to this grocery and  emptyin' their six-shooters in the air afore they 'light. We want to put  a stop to it peacefully and without a row--and we kin. We ain't got no  bullies of our own to fight back, and they know it, so they know they  won't get no credit bullyin' us; they'll leave, if we're only firm. It's  all along of our cussed fool good-nature; they see it amuses us, and  they'll keep it up as long as the whisky's free. What we want to do is,  when the next man comes waltzin' along--”    A distant clatter from the rocky hillside here mingled with the puff of  damp air through the window.    “Looks as ef we might hev a show even now,” said Tom Rollins, removing  his feet from the stove as we all instinctively faced toward the window.    “I reckon you're in with us in this, Mosby?” said Briggs, turning toward  the proprietor of the grocery, who had been leaning listlessly against  the wall behind his bar.    “Arter the man's had a fair show,” said Mosby, cautiously. He deprecated  the prevailing condition of things, but it was still an open question  whether the families would prove as valuable customers as his present  clients. “Everything in moderation, gentlemen.”    The sound of galloping hoofs came nearer, now swishing in the soft mud  of the highway, until the unseen rider pulled up before the door. There  was no shouting, however, nor did he announce himself with the usual  salvo of firearms. But when, after a singularly heavy tread and the  jingle of spurs on the platform, the door flew open to the newcomer,  he seemed a realization of our worst expectations. Tall, broad, and  muscular, he carried in one hand a shotgun, while from his hip dangled  a heavy navy revolver. His long hair, unkempt but oiled, swept a greasy  circle around his shoulders; his enormous mustache, dripping with wet,  completely concealed his mouth. His costume of fringed buckskin was wild  and outre even for our frontier camp. But what was more confirmative  of our suspicions was that he was evidently in the habit of making an  impression, and after a distinct pause at the doorway, with only a side  glance at us, he strode toward the bar.    “As there don't seem to be no hotel hereabouts, I reckon I kin put up  my mustang here and have a shakedown somewhere behind that counter,” he  said. His voice seemed to have added to its natural depth the hoarseness  of frequent overstraining.    “Ye ain't got no bunk to spare, you boys, hev ye?” asked Mosby,  evasively, glancing at Percy Briggs without looking at the stranger.  We all looked at Briggs also; it was HIS affair after all--HE had  originated this opposition. To our surprise he said nothing.    The stranger leaned heavily on the counter.    “I was speaking to YOU,” he said, with his eyes on Mosby, and slightly  accenting the pronoun with a tap of his revolver butt on the bar. “Ye  don't seem to catch on.”    Mosby smiled feebly, and again cast an imploring glance at Briggs. To  our greater astonishment, Briggs said, quietly: “Why don't you answer  the stranger, Mosby?”    “Yes, yes,” said Mosby, suavely, to the newcomer, while an angry flush  crossed his check as he recognized the position in which Briggs had  placed him. “Of course, you're welcome to what doings I hev here, but I  reckoned these gentlemen over there,” with a vicious glance at Briggs,  “might fix ye up suthin' better; they're so pow'ful kind to your sort.”    The stranger threw down a gold piece on the counter and said: “Fork out  your whisky, then,” waited until his glass was filled, took it in his  hand, and then, drawing an empty chair to the stove, sat down beside  Briggs. “Seein' as you're that kind,” he said, placing his heavy hand  on Briggs's knee, “mebbe ye kin tell me ef thar's a shanty or a cabin at  Rattlesnake that I kin get for a couple o' weeks. I saw an empty one at  the head o' the hill. You see, gennelmen,” he added confidentially as  he swept the drops of whisky from his long mustache with his fingers and  glanced around our group, “I've got some business over at Bigwood,” our  nearest town, “but ez a place to stay AT it ain't my style.”    “What's the matter with Bigwood?” said Briggs, abruptly.    “It's too howlin', too festive, too rough; thar's too much yellin'  and shootin' goin' day and night. Thar's too many card sharps and gay  gamboliers cavortin' about the town to please me. Too much permiskus  soakin' at the bar and free jimjams. What I want is a quiet place what  a man kin give his mind and elbow a rest from betwixt grippin' his  shootin' irons and crookin' in his whisky. A sort o' slow, quiet, easy  place LIKE THIS.”    We all stared at him, Percy Briggs as fixedly as any. But there was not  the slightest trace of irony, sarcasm, or peculiar significance in his  manner. He went on slowly:    “When I struck this yer camp a minit ago; when I seed that thar ditch  meanderin' peaceful like through the street, without a hotel or free  saloon or express office on either side; with the smoke just a curlin'  over the chimbley of that log shanty, and the bresh just set fire to and  a smolderin' in that potato patch with a kind o' old-time stingin' in  your eyes and nose, and a few women's duds just a flutterin' on a line  by the fence, I says to myself: 'Bulger--this is peace! This is wot  you're lookin' for, Bulger--this is wot you're wantin'--this is wot  YOU'LL HEV!'”    “You say you've business over at Bigwood. What business?” said Briggs.    “It's a peculiar business, young fellow,” returned the stranger,  gravely. “Thar's different men ez has different opinions about it. Some  allows it's an easy business, some allows it's a rough business; some  says it's a sad business, others says it's gay and festive. Some wonders  ez how I've got into it, and others wonder how I'll ever get out of it.  It's a payin' business--it's a peaceful sort o' business when left to  itself. It's a peculiar business--a business that sort o' b'longs to  me, though I ain't got no patent from Washington for it. It's MY OWN  business.” He paused, rose, and saying, “Let's meander over and take a  look at that empty cabin, and ef she suits me, why, I'll plank down  a slug for her on the spot, and move in tomorrow,” walked towards the  door. “I'll pick up suthin' in the way o' boxes and blankets from the  grocery,” he added, looking at Mosby, “and ef thar's a corner whar I kin  stand my gun and a nail to hang up my revolver--why, I'm all thar!”    By this time we were no longer astonished when Briggs rose also, and not  only accompanied the sinister-looking stranger to the empty cabin, but  assisted him in negotiating with its owner for a fortnight's occupancy.  Nevertheless, we eagerly assailed Briggs on his return for some  explanation of this singular change in his attitude toward the stranger.  He coolly reminded us, however, that while his intention of excluding  ruffianly adventurers from the camp remained the same, he had no right  to go back on the stranger's sentiments, which were evidently in accord  with our own, and although Mr. Bulger's appearance was inconsistent with  them, that was only an additional reason why we should substitute a  mild firmness for that violence which we all deprecated, but which might  attend his abrupt dismissal. We were all satisfied except Mosby, who had  not yet recovered from Briggs's change of front, which he was pleased  to call “craw-fishing.” “Seemed to me his account of his business was  extraordinary satisfactory! Sorter filled the bill all round--no mistake  thar,” he suggested, with a malicious irony. “I like a man that's  outspoken.”    “I understood him very well,” said Briggs, quietly.    “In course you did. Only when you've settled in your MIND whether he  was describing horse-stealing or tract-distributing, mebbe you'll let ME  know.”    It would seem, however, that Briggs did not interrogate the stranger  again regarding it, nor did we, who were quite content to leave matters  in Briggs's hands. Enough that Mr. Bulger moved into the empty cabin the  next day, and, with the aid of a few old boxes from the grocery, which  he quickly extemporized into tables and chairs, and the purchase of some  necessary cooking utensils, soon made himself at home. The rest of the  camp, now thoroughly aroused, made a point of leaving their work in  the ditches, whenever they could, to stroll carelessly around Bulger's  tenement in the vague hope of satisfying a curiosity that had become  tormenting. But they could not find that he was doing anything of a  suspicious character--except, perhaps, from the fact that it was  not OUTWARDLY suspicious, which I grieve to say did not lull them to  security. He seemed to be either fixing up his cabin or smoking in his  doorway. On the second day he checked this itinerant curiosity by taking  the initiative himself, and quietly walking from claim to claim and from  cabin to cabin with a pacific but by no means a satisfying interest. The  shadow of his tall figure carrying his inseparable gun, which had not  yet apparently “stood in the corner,” falling upon an excavated bank  beside the delving miners, gave them a sense of uneasiness they could  not explain; a few characteristic yells of boisterous hilarity from  their noontide gathering under a cottonwood somehow ceased when Mr.  Bulger was seen gravely approaching, and his casual stopping before  a poker party in the gulch actually caused one of the most reckless  gamblers to weakly recede from “a bluff” and allow his adversary to  sweep the board. After this it was felt that matters were becoming  serious. There was no subsequent patrolling of the camp before the  stranger's cabin. Their curiosity was singularly abated. A general  feeling of repulsion, kept within bounds partly by the absence of any  overt act from Bulger, and partly by an inconsistent over-consciousness  of his shotgun, took its place. But an unexpected occurrence revived it.    One evening, as the usual social circle were drawn around Mosby's stove,  the lazy silence was broken by the familiar sounds of pistol shots and a  series of more familiar shrieks and yells from the rocky hill road. The  circle quickly recognized the voices of their old friends the roisterers  and gamblers from Sawyer's Dam; they as quickly recognized the returning  shouts here and there from a few companions who were welcoming them. I  grieve to say that in spite of their previous attitude of reformation a  smile of gratified expectancy lit up the faces of the younger members,  and even the older ones glanced dubiously at Briggs. Mosby made no  attempt to conceal a sigh of relief as he carefully laid out an extra  supply of glasses in his bar. Suddenly the oncoming yells ceased, the  wild gallop of hoofs slackened into a trot, and finally halted, and even  the responsive shouts of the camp stopped also. We all looked vacantly  at each other; Mosby leaped over his counter and went to the door;  Briggs followed with the rest of us. The night was dark, and it was a  few minutes before we could distinguish a straggling, vague, but silent  procession moving through the moist, heavy air on the hill. But, to our  surprise, it was moving away from us--absolutely LEAVING the camp! We  were still staring in expectancy when out of the darkness slowly emerged  a figure which we recognized at once as Captain Jim, one of the most  reckless members of our camp. Pushing us back into the grocery he  entered without a word, closed the door behind him, and threw himself  vacantly into a chair. We at once pressed around him. He looked up at us  dazedly, drew a long breath, and said slowly:    “It's no use, gentlemen! Suthin's GOT to be done with that Bulger; and  mighty quick.”    “What's the matter?” we asked eagerly.    “Matter!” he repeated, passing his hand across his forehead. “Matter!  Look yere! Ye all of you heard them boys from Sawyer's Dam coming over  the hill? Ye heard their music--mebbe ye heard US join in the chorus?  Well, on they came waltzing down the hill, like old times, and we  waitin' for 'em. Then, jest as they passed the old cabin, who do you  think they ran right into--shooting iron, long hair and mustache, and  all that--standing there plump in the road? why, Bulger!”    “Well?”    “Well!--Whatever it was--don't ask ME--but, dern my skin, ef after a  word or two from HIM--them boys just stopped yellin', turned round like  lambs, and rode away, peaceful-like, along with him. We ran after them  a spell, still yellin', when that thar Bulger faced around, said to us  that he'd 'come down here for quiet,' and ef he couldn't hev it he'd  have to leave with those gentlemen WHO WANTED IT too! And I'm gosh  darned ef those GENTLEMEN--you know 'em all--Patsey Carpenter, Snapshot  Harry, and the others--ever said a darned word, but kinder nodded 'So  long' and went away!”    Our astonishment and mystification were complete; and I regret to say,  the indignation of Captain Jim and Mosby equally so. “If we're going to  be bossed by the first newcomer,” said the former, gloomily, “I reckon  we might as well take our chances with the Sawyer's Dam boys, whom we  know.”    “Ef we are going to hev the legitimate trade of Rattlesnake interfered  with by the cranks of some hidin' horse thief or retired road agent,”   said Mosby, “we might as well invite the hull of Joaquin Murietta's  gang here at once! But I suppose this is part o' Bulger's particular  'business,'” he added, with a withering glance at Briggs.    “I understand it all,” said Briggs, quietly. “You know I told you  that bullies couldn't live in the same camp together. That's human  nature--and that's how plain men like you and me manage to scud along  without getting plugged. You see, Bulger wasn't going to hev any of his  own kind jumpin' his claim here. And I reckon he was pow'ful enough to  back down Sawyer's Dam. Anyhow, the bluff told--and here we are in peace  and quietness.”    “Until he lets us know what is his little game,” sneered Mosby.    Nevertheless, such is the force of mysterious power that although it was  exercised against what we firmly believed was the independence of the  camp, it extorted a certain respect from us. A few thought it was not a  bad thing to have a professional bully, and even took care to relate the  discomfiture of the wicked youth of Sawyer's Dam for the benefit of  a certain adjacent and powerful camp who had looked down upon us.  He himself, returning the same evening from his self-imposed escort,  vouchsafed no other reason than the one he had already given.  Preposterous as it seemed, we were obliged to accept it, and the still  more preposterous inference that he had sought Rattlesnake Camp solely  for the purpose of acquiring and securing its peace and quietness.  Certainly he had no other occupation; the little work he did upon the  tailings of the abandoned claim which went with his little cabin was  scarcely a pretense. He rode over on certain days to Bigwood on account  of his business, but no one had ever seen him there, nor could the  description of his manner and appearance evoke any information from the  Bigwoodians. It remained a mystery.    It had also been feared that the advent of Bulger would intensify that  fear and dislike of riotous Rattlesnake which the two families  had shown, and which was the origin of Briggs's futile attempt at  reformation. But it was discovered that since his arrival the young  girls had shown less timidity in entering the camp, and had even  exchanged some polite conversation and good-humoured badinage with its  younger and more impressible members. Perhaps this tended to make these  youths more observant, for a few days later, when the vexed question  of Bulger's business was again under discussion, one of them remarked,  gloomily:    “I reckon there ain't no doubt WHAT he's here for!”    The youthful prophet was instantly sat upon after the fashion of  all elderly critics since Job's. Nevertheless, after a pause he was  permitted to explain.    “Only this morning, when Lance Forester and me were chirping with them  gals out on the hill, who should we see hanging around in the bush but  that cussed Bulger! We allowed at first that it might be only a new  style of his interferin', so we took no notice, except to pass a few  remarks about listeners and that sort o' thing, and perhaps to bedevil  the girls a little more than we'd hev done if we'd been alone. Well,  they laughed, and we laughed--and that was the end of it. But this  afternoon, as Lance and me were meandering down by their cabin, we  sorter turned into the woods to wait till they'd come out. Then all of  a suddent Lance stopped as rigid as a pointer that's flushed somethin',  and says, 'B'gosh!' And thar, under a big redwood, sat that slimy  hypocrite Bulger, twisting his long mustaches and smiling like clockwork  alongside o' little Meely Baker--you know her, the pootiest of the  two sisters--and she smilin' back on him. Think of it! that unknown,  unwashed, longhaired tramp and bully, who must be forty if a day, and  that innocent gal of sixteen. It was simply disgustin'!”    I need not say that the older cynics and critics already alluded to at  once improved the occasion. 'What more could be expected? Women,  the world over, were noted for this sort of thing! This long-haired,  swaggering bully, with his air of mystery, had captivated them, as he  always had done since the days of Homer. Simple merit, which sat lowly  in barrooms, and conceived projects for the public good around the  humble, unostentatious stove, was nowhere! Youth could not too soon  learn this bitter lesson. And in this case youth too, perhaps, was  right in its conjectures, for this WAS, no doubt, the little game of the  perfidious Bulger. We recalled the fact that his unhallowed appearance  in camp was almost coincident with the arrival of the two families.  We glanced at Briggs; to our amazement, for the first time he looked  seriously concerned. But Mosby in the meantime leaned his elbows lazily  over the counter and, in a slow voice, added fuel to the flame.    “I wouldn't hev spoken of it before,” he said, with a sidelong glance  at Briggs, “for it might be all in the line o' Bulger's 'business,'  but suthin' happened the other night that, for a minit, got me! I was  passin' the Bakers' shanty, and I heard one of them gals a singing a  camp-meeting hymn. I don't calkilate to run agin you young fellers in  any sparkin' or canoodlin' that's goin' on, but her voice sounded so  pow'ful soothin' and pretty thet I jest stood there and listened. Then  the old woman--old Mother Baker--SHE joined in, and I listened too. And  then--dern my skin!--but a man's voice joined in--jest belching outer  that cabin!--and I sorter lifted myself up and kem away.    “That voice, gentlemen,” said Mosby, lingering artistically as he took  up a glass and professionally eyed it before wiping it with his towel,  “that voice, cumf'bly fixed thar in thet cabin among them wimen folks,  was Bulger's!”    Briggs got up, with his eyes looking the darker for his flushed face.  “Gentlemen,” he said huskily, “thar's only one thing to be done. A lot  of us have got to ride over to Sawyer's Dam tomorrow morning and pick up  as many square men as we can muster; there's a big camp meeting goin'  on there, and there won't be no difficulty in that. When we've got a big  enough crowd to show we mean business, we must march back here and ride  Bulger out of this camp! I don't hanker arter Vigilance Committees, as  a rule--it's a rough remedy--it's like drinkin' a quart o' whisky agin  rattlesnake poison but it's got to be done! We don't mind being sold  ourselves but when it comes to our standin' by and seein' the only  innocent people in Rattlesnake given away--we kick! Bulger's got to be  fired outer this camp! And he will be!”    But he was not.    For when, the next morning, a determined and thoughtful procession of  the best and most characteristic citizens of Rattlesnake Camp filed into  Sawyer's Dam, they found that their mysterious friends had disappeared,  although they met with a fraternal but subdued welcome from the general  camp. But any approach to the subject of their visit, however,  was received with a chilling dissapproval. Did they not know that  lawlessness of any kind, even under the rude mantle of frontier justice,  was to be deprecated and scouted when a “means of salvation, a power of  regeneration,” such as was now sweeping over Sawyer's Dam, was at hand?  Could they not induce this man who was to be violently deported to  accompany them willingly to Sawyer's Dam and subject himself to the  powerful influence of the “revival” then in full swing?    The Rattlesnake boys laughed bitterly, and described the man of whom  they talked so lightly; but in vain. “It's no use, gentlemen,” said  a more worldly bystander, in a lower voice, “the camp meetin's got a  strong grip here, and betwixt you and me there ain't no wonder. For the  man that runs it--the big preacher--has got new ways and methods that  fetches the boys every time. He don't preach no cut-and-dried gospel; he  don't carry around no slop-shop robes and clap 'em on you whether they  fit or not; but he samples and measures the camp afore he wades into  it. He scouts and examines; he ain't no mere Sunday preacher with a  comfortable house and once-a-week church, but he gives up his days and  nights to it, and makes his family work with him, and even sends 'em  forward to explore the field. And he ain't no white-choker shadbelly  either, but fits himself, like his gospel, to the men he works among. Ye  ought to hear him afore you go. His tent is just out your way. I'll go  with you.”    Too dejected to offer any opposition, and perhaps a little curious to  see this man who had unwittingly frustrated their design of lynching  Bulger, they halted at the outer fringe of worshipers who packed the  huge inclosure. They had not time to indulge their cynicisms over this  swaying mass of emotional, half-thinking, and almost irresponsible  beings, nor to detect any similarity between THEIR extreme methods and  the scheme of redemption they themselves were seeking, for in a  few moments, apparently lifted to his feet on a wave of religious  exultation, the famous preacher arose. The men of Rattlesnake gasped for  breath.    It was Bulger!    But Briggs quickly recovered himself. “By what name,” said he, turning  passionately towards his guide, “does this man--this impostor--call  himself here?”    “Baker.”    “Baker?” echoed the Rattlesnake contingent.    “Baker?” repeated Lance Forester, with a ghastly smile.    “Yes,” returned their guide. “You oughter know it too! For he sent his  wife and daughters over, after his usual style, to sample your camp, a  week ago! Come, now, what are you givin' us?”          IN THE TULES      He had never seen a steamboat in his life. Born and reared in one of the  Western Territories, far from a navigable river, he had only known the  “dugout” or canoe as a means of conveyance across the scant streams  whose fordable waters made even those scarcely a necessity. The long,  narrow, hooded wagon, drawn by swaying oxen, known familiarly as  a “prairie schooner,” in which he journeyed across the plains to  California in '53, did not help his conception by that nautical figure.  And when at last he dropped upon the land of promise through one of the  Southern mountain passes he halted all unconsciously upon the low banks  of a great yellow river amidst a tangled brake of strange, reed-like  grasses that were unknown to him. The river, broadening as it debouched  through many channels into a lordly bay, seemed to him the ULTIMA THULE  of his journeyings. Unyoking his oxen on the edge of the luxuriant  meadows which blended with scarcely any line of demarcation into the  great stream itself, he found the prospect “good” according to his  lights and prairial experiences, and, converting his halted wagon into a  temporary cabin, he resolved to rest here and “settle.”    There was little difficulty in so doing. The cultivated clearings he had  passed were few and far between; the land would be his by discovery  and occupation; his habits of loneliness and self-reliance made him  independent of neighbors. He took his first meal in his new solitude  under a spreading willow, but so near his natural boundary that the  waters gurgled and oozed in the reeds but a few feet from him. The  sun sank, deepening the gold of the river until it might have been the  stream of Pactolus itself. But Martin Morse had no imagination; he was  not even a gold-seeker; he had simply obeyed the roving instincts of the  frontiersman in coming hither. The land was virgin and unoccupied; it  was his; he was alone. These questions settled, he smoked his pipe with  less concern over his three thousand miles' transference of habitation  than the man of cities who had moved into a next street. When the  sun sank, he rolled himself in his blankets in the wagon bed and went  quietly to sleep.    But he was presently awakened by something which at first he could  not determine to be a noise or an intangible sensation. It was a deep  throbbing through the silence of the night--a pulsation that seemed even  to be communicated to the rude bed whereon he lay. As it came nearer  it separated itself into a labored, monotonous panting, continuous, but  distinct from an equally monotonous but fainter beating of the waters,  as if the whole track of the river were being coursed and trodden by a  multitude of swiftly trampling feet. A strange feeling took possession  of him--half of fear, half of curious expectation. It was coming nearer.  He rose, leaped hurriedly from the wagon, and ran to the bank. The night  was dark; at first he saw nothing before him but the steel-black sky  pierced with far-spaced, irregularly scattered stars. Then there seemed  to be approaching him, from the left, another and more symmetrical  constellation--a few red and blue stars high above the river, with  three compact lines of larger planetary lights flashing towards him and  apparently on his own level. It was almost upon him; he involuntarily  drew back as the strange phenomenon swept abreast of where he stood, and  resolved itself into a dark yet airy bulk, whose vagueness, topped by  enormous towers, was yet illuminated by those open squares of light  that he had taken for stars, but which he saw now were brilliantly lit  windows.    Their vivid rays shot through the reeds and sent broad bands across the  meadow, the stationary wagon, and the slumbering oxen. But all this was  nothing to the inner life they disclosed through lifted curtains and  open blinds, which was the crowning revelation of this strange and  wonderful spectacle. Elegantly dressed men and women moved through  brilliantly lit and elaborately gilt saloons; in one a banquet seemed  to be spread, served by white-jacketed servants; in another were men  playing cards around marble-topped tables; in another the light flashed  back again from the mirrors and glistening glasses and decanters of  a gorgeous refreshment saloon; in smaller openings there was the shy  disclosure of dainty white curtains and velvet lounges of more intimate  apartments.    Martin Morse stood enthralled and mystified. It was as if some invisible  Asmodeus had revealed to this simple frontiersman a world of which he  had never dreamed. It was THE world--a world of which he knew nothing  in his simple, rustic habits and profound Western isolation--sweeping by  him with the rush of an unknown planet. In another moment it was gone; a  shower of sparks shot up from one of the towers and fell all around him,  and then vanished, even as he remembered the set piece of “Fourth of  July” fireworks had vanished in his own rural town when he was a boy.  The darkness fell with it too. But such was his utter absorption and  breathless preoccupation that only a cold chill recalled him to himself,  and he found he was standing mid-leg deep in the surge cast over the low  banks by this passage of the first steamboat he had ever seen!    He waited for it the next night, when it appeared a little later from  the opposite direction on its return trip. He watched it the next night  and the next. Hereafter he never missed it, coming or going--whatever  the hard and weary preoccupations of his new and lonely life. He felt he  could not have slept without seeing it go by. Oddly enough, his interest  and desire did not go further. Even had he the time and money to spend  in a passage on the boat, and thus actively realize the great world of  which he had only these rare glimpses, a certain proud, rustic shyness  kept him from it. It was not HIS world; he could not affront the snubs  that his ignorance and inexperience would have provoked, and he was  dimly conscious, as so many of us are in our ignorance, that in mingling  with it he would simply lose the easy privileges of alien criticism. For  there was much that he did not understand, and some things that grated  upon his lonely independence.    One night, a lighter one than those previous, he lingered a little  longer in the moonlight to watch the phosphorescent wake of the  retreating boat. Suddenly it struck him that there was a certain  irregular splashing in the water, quite different from the regular,  diagonally crossing surges that the boat swept upon the bank. Looking  at it more intently, he saw a black object turning in the water like  a porpoise, and then the unmistakable uplifting of a black arm in an  unskillful swimmer's overhand stroke. It was a struggling man. But it  was quickly evident that the current was too strong and the turbulence  of the shallow water too great for his efforts. Without a moment's  hesitation, clad as he was in only his shirt and trousers, Morse  strode into the reeds, and the next moment, with a call of warning, was  swimming toward the now wildly struggling figure. But, from some unknown  reason, as Morse approached him nearer the man uttered some incoherent  protest and desperately turned away, throwing off Morse's extended arm.    Attributing this only to the vague convulsions of a drowning man, Morse,  a skilled swimmer, managed to clutch his shoulder, and propelled him at  arm's length, still struggling, apparently with as much reluctance as  incapacity, toward the bank. As their feet touched the reeds and slimy  bottom the man's resistance ceased, and he lapsed quite listlessly in  Morse's arms. Half lifting, half dragging his burden, he succeeded at  last in gaining the strip of meadow, and deposited the unconscious man  beneath the willow tree. Then he ran to his wagon for whisky.    But, to his surprise, on his return the man was already sitting up and  wringing the water from his clothes. He then saw for the first time,  by the clear moonlight, that the stranger was elegantly dressed and  of striking appearance, and was clearly a part of that bright and  fascinating world which Morse had been contemplating in his solitude. He  eagerly took the proffered tin cup and drank the whisky. Then he rose  to his feet, staggered a few steps forward, and glanced curiously around  him at the still motionless wagon, the few felled trees and evidence of  “clearing,” and even at the rude cabin of logs and canvas just beginning  to rise from the ground a few paces distant, and said, impatiently:    “Where the devil am I?”    Morse hesitated. He was unable to name the locality of his  dwelling-place. He answered briefly:    “On the right bank of the Sacramento.”    The stranger turned upon him a look of suspicion not unmingled with  resentment. “Oh!” he said, with ironical gravity, “and I suppose that  this water you picked me out of was the Sacramento River. Thank you!”    Morse, with slow Western patience, explained that he had only settled  there three weeks ago, and the place had no name.    “What's your nearest town, then?”    “Thar ain't any. Thar's a blacksmith's shop and grocery at the  crossroads, twenty miles further on, but it's got no name as I've heard  on.”    The stranger's look of suspicion passed. “Well,” he said, in an imperative  fashion, which, however, seemed as much the result of habit as the  occasion, “I want a horse, and mighty quick, too.”    “H'ain't got any.”    “No horse? How did you get to this place?”    Morse pointed to the slumbering oxen.    The stranger again stared curiously at him. After a pause he said, with  a half-pitying, half-humorous smile: “Pike--aren't you?”    Whether Morse did or did not know that this current California slang  for a denizen of the bucolic West implied a certain contempt, he replied  simply:    “I'm from Pike County, Mizzouri.”    “Well,” said the stranger, resuming his impatient manner, “you must beg  or steal a horse from your neighbors.”    “Thar ain't any neighbor nearer than fifteen miles.”    “Then send fifteen miles! Stop.” He opened his still clinging shirt  and drew out a belt pouch, which he threw to Morse. “There! there's two  hundred and fifty dollars in that. Now, I want a horse. Sabe?”    “Thar ain't anyone to send,” said Morse, quietly.    “Do you mean to say you are all alone here?”    “Yes.    “And you fished me out--all by yourself?”    “Yes.”    The stranger again examined him curiously. Then he suddenly stretched  out his hand and grasped his companion's.    “All right; if you can't send, I reckon I can manage to walk over there  tomorrow.”    “I was goin' on to say,” said Morse, simply, “that if you'll lie by  tonight, I'll start over sunup, after puttin' out the cattle, and fetch  you back a horse afore noon.”    “That's enough.” He, however, remained looking curiously at Morse. “Did  you never hear,” he said, with a singular smile, “that it was about the  meanest kind of luck that could happen to you to save a drowning man?”    “No,” said Morse, simply. “I reckon it orter be the meanest if you  DIDN'T.”    “That depends upon the man you save,” said the stranger, with the same  ambiguous smile, “and whether the SAVING him is only putting things off.  Look here,” he added, with an abrupt return to his imperative style,  “can't you give me some dry clothes?”    Morse brought him a pair of overalls and a “hickory shirt,” well worn,  but smelling strongly of a recent wash with coarse soap. The stranger  put them on while his companion busied himself in collecting a pile of  sticks and dry leaves.    “What's that for?” said the stranger, suddenly.    “A fire to dry your clothes.”    The stranger calmly kicked the pile aside.    “Not any fire tonight if I know it,” he said, brusquely. Before Morse  could resent his quickly changing moods he continued, in another tone,  dropping to an easy reclining position beneath the tree, “Now, tell me  all about yourself, and what you are doing here.”    Thus commanded, Morse patiently repeated his story from the time he  had left his backwoods cabin to his selection of the river bank for a  “location.” He pointed out the rich quality of this alluvial bottom  and its adaptability for the raising of stock, which he hoped soon  to acquire. The stranger smiled grimly, raised himself to a sitting  position, and, taking a penknife from his damp clothes, began to clean  his nails in the bright moonlight--an occupation which made the simple  Morse wander vaguely in his narration.    “And you don't know that this hole will give you chills and fever till  you'll shake yourself out of your boots?”    Morse had lived before in aguish districts, and had no fear.    “And you never heard that some night the whole river will rise up and  walk over you and your cabin and your stock?”    “No. For I reckon to move my shanty farther back.”    The man shut up his penknife with a click and rose.    “If you've got to get up at sunrise, we'd better be turning in. I  suppose you can give me a pair of blankets?”    Morse pointed to the wagon. “Thar's a shakedown in the wagon bed; you  kin lie there.” Nevertheless he hesitated, and, with the inconsequence  and abruptness of a shy man, continued the previous conversation.    “I shouldn't like to move far away, for them steamboats is pow'ful  kempany o' nights. I never seed one afore I kem here,” and then, with  the inconsistency of a reserved man, and without a word of further  preliminary, he launched into a confidential disclosure of his late  experiences. The stranger listened with a singular interest and a  quietly searching eye.    “Then you were watching the boat very closely just now when you saw me.  What else did you see? Anything before that--before you saw me in the  water?”    “No--the boat had got well off before I saw you at all.”    “Ah,” said the stranger. “Well, I'm going to turn in.” He walked to the  wagon, mounted it, and by the time that Morse had reached it with his  wet clothes he was already wrapped in the blankets. A moment later he  seemed to be in a profound slumber.    It was only then, when his guest was lying helplessly at his mercy, that  he began to realize his strange experiences. The domination of this  man had been so complete that Morse, although by nature independent  and self-reliant, had not permitted himself to question his right or  to resent his rudeness. He had accepted his guest's careless or  premeditated silence regarding the particulars of his accident as a  matter of course, and had never dreamed of questioning him. That it was  a natural accident of that great world so apart from his own experiences  he did not doubt, and thought no more about it. The advent of the man  himself was greater to him than the causes which brought him there. He  was as yet quite unconscious of the complete fascination this mysterious  stranger held over him, but he found himself shyly pleased with even the  slight interest he had displayed in his affairs, and his hand felt yet  warm and tingling from his sudden soft but expressive grasp, as if it  had been a woman's. There is a simple intuition of friendship in some  lonely, self-abstracted natures that is nearly akin to love at first  sight. Even the audacities and insolence of this stranger affected  Morse as he might have been touched and captivated by the coquetries  or imperiousness of some bucolic virgin. And this reserved and shy  frontiersman found himself that night sleepless, and hovering with an  abashed timidity and consciousness around the wagon that sheltered his  guest, as if he had been a very Corydon watching the moonlit couch of  some slumbering Amaryllis.    He was off by daylight--after having placed a rude breakfast by the side  of the still sleeping guest--and before midday he had returned with a  horse. When he handed the stranger his pouch, less the amount he had  paid for the horse, the man said curtly:    “What's that for?”    “Your change. I paid only fifty dollars for the horse.”    The stranger regarded him with his peculiar smile. Then, replacing the  pouch in his belt, he shook Morse's hand again and mounted the horse.    “So your name's Martin Morse! Well--goodby, Morsey!”    Morse hesitated. A blush rose to his dark check. “You didn't tell me  your name,” he said. “In case--”    “In case I'm WANTED? Well, you can call me Captain Jack.” He smiled,  and, nodding his head, put spurs to his mustang and cantered away.    Morse did not do much work that day, falling into abstracted moods and  living over his experiences of the previous night, until he fancied he  could almost see his strange guest again. The narrow strip of meadow was  haunted by him. There was the tree under which he had first placed  him, and that was where he had seen him sitting up in his dripping but  well-fitting clothes. In the rough garments he had worn and returned  lingered a new scent of some delicate soap, overpowering the strong  alkali flavor of his own. He was early by the river side, having a vague  hope, he knew not why, that he should again see him and recognize him  among the passengers. He was wading out among the reeds, in the faint  light of the rising moon, recalling the exact spot where he had first  seen the stranger, when he was suddenly startled by the rolling over in  the water of some black object that had caught against the bank, but  had been dislodged by his movements. To his horror it bore a faint  resemblance to his first vision of the preceding night. But a second  glance at the helplessly floating hair and bloated outline showed him  that it was a DEAD man, and of a type and build far different from his  former companion. There was a bruise upon his matted forehead and an  enormous wound in his throat already washed bloodless, white, and waxen.  An inexplicable fear came upon him, not at the sight of the corpse, for  he had been in Indian massacres and had rescued bodies mutilated beyond  recognition; but from some moral dread that, strangely enough, quickened  and deepened with the far-off pant of the advancing steamboat. Scarcely  knowing why, he dragged the body hurriedly ashore, concealing it in the  reeds, as if he were disposing of the evidence of his own crime. Then,  to his preposterous terror, he noticed that the panting of the steamboat  and the beat of its paddles were “slowing” as the vague bulk came in  sight, until a huge wave from the suddenly arrested wheels sent a  surge like an enormous heartbeat pulsating through the sedge that half  submerged him. The flashing of three or four lanterns on deck and the  motionless line of lights abreast of him dazzled his eyes, but he knew  that the low fringe of willows hid his house and wagon completely from  view. A vague murmur of voices from the deck was suddenly overridden by  a sharp order, and to his relief the slowly revolving wheels again sent  a pulsation through the water, and the great fabric moved solemnly away.  A sense of relief came over him, he knew not why, and he was conscious  that for the first time he had not cared to look at the boat.    When the moon arose he again examined the body, and took from its  clothing a few articles of identification and some papers of formality  and precision, which he vaguely conjectured to be some law papers from  their resemblance to the phrasing of sheriffs' and electors' notices  which he had seen in the papers. He then buried the corpse in a shallow  trench, which he dug by the light of the moon. He had no question of  responsibility; his pioneer training had not included coroners' inquests  in its experience; in giving the body a speedy and secure burial  from predatory animals he did what one frontiersman would do for  another--what he hoped might be done for him. If his previous  unaccountable feelings returned occasionally, it was not from that;  but rather from some uneasiness in regard to his late guest's possible  feelings, and a regret that he had not been here at the finding of the  body. That it would in some way have explained his own accident he did  not doubt.    The boat did not “slow up” the next night, but passed as usual; yet  three or four days elapsed before he could look forward to its coming  with his old extravagant and half-exalted curiosity--which was his  nearest approach to imagination. He was then able to examine it more  closely, for the appearance of the stranger whom he now began to call  “his friend” in his verbal communings with himself--but whom he did not  seem destined to again discover; until one day, to his astonishment, a  couple of fine horses were brought to his clearing by a stock-drover.  They had been “ordered” to be left there. In vain Morse expostulated and  questioned.    “Your name's Martin Morse, ain't it?” said the drover, with business  brusqueness; “and I reckon there ain't no other man o' that name around  here?”    “No,” said Morse.    “Well, then, they're YOURS.”    “But who sent them?” insisted Morse. “What was his name, and where does  he live?”    “I didn't know ez I was called upon to give the pedigree o' buyers,”   said the drover dryly; “but the horses is 'Morgan,' you can bet your  life.” He grinned as he rode away.    That Captain Jack sent them, and that it was a natural prelude to his  again visiting him, Morse did not doubt, and for a few days he lived  in that dream. But Captain Jack did not come. The animals were of great  service to him in “rounding up” the stock he now easily took in for  pasturage, and saved him the necessity of having a partner or a hired  man. The idea that this superior gentleman in fine clothes might ever  appear to him in the former capacity had even flitted through his brain,  but he had rejected it with a sigh. But the thought that, with luck and  industry, he himself might, in course of time, approximate to Captain  Jack's evident station, DID occur to him, and was an incentive to  energy. Yet it was quite distinct from the ordinary working man's  ambition of wealth and state. It was only that it might make him more  worthy of his friend. The great world was still as it had appeared  to him in the passing boat--a thing to wonder at--to be above--and to  criticize.    For all that, he prospered in his occupation. But one day he woke with  listless limbs and feet that scarcely carried him through his daily  labors. At night his listlessness changed to active pain and a  feverishness that seemed to impel him toward the fateful river, as if  his one aim in life was to drink up its waters and bathe in its yellow  stream. But whenever he seemed to attempt it, strange dreams assailed  him of dead bodies arising with swollen and distorted lips to touch his  own as he strove to drink, or of his mysterious guest battling with him  in its current, and driving him ashore. Again, when he essayed to bathe  his parched and crackling limbs in its flood, he would be confronted  with the dazzling lights of the motionless steamboat and the glare of  stony eyes--until he fled in aimless terror. How long this lasted he  knew not, until one morning he awoke in his new cabin with a strange man  sitting by his bed and a Negress in the doorway.    “You've had a sharp attack of 'tule fever,'” said the stranger, dropping  Morse's listless wrist and answering his questioning eyes, “but you're  all right now, and will pull through.”    “Who are you?” stammered Morse feebly.    “Dr. Duchesne, of Sacramento.”    “How did you come here?”    “I was ordered to come to you and bring a nurse, as you were alone.  There she is.” He pointed to the smiling Negress.    “WHO ordered you?”    The doctor smiled with professional tolerance. “One of your friends, of  course.”    “But what was his name?”    “Really, I don't remember. But don't distress yourself. He has settled  for everything right royally. You have only to get strong now. My duty  is ended, and I can safely leave you with the nurse. Only when you are  strong again, I say--and HE says--keep back farther from the river.”    And that was all he knew. For even the nurse who attended him through  the first days of his brief convalescence would tell him nothing more.  He quickly got rid of her and resumed his work, for a new and strange  phase of his simple, childish affection for his benefactor, partly  superinduced by his illness, was affecting him. He was beginning to  feel the pain of an unequal friendship; he was dimly conscious that his  mysterious guest was only coldly returning his hospitality and benefits,  while holding aloof from any association with him--and indicating the  immeasurable distance that separated their future intercourse. He had  withheld any kind message or sympathetic greeting; he had kept back even  his NAME. The shy, proud, ignorant heart of the frontiersman swelled  beneath the fancied slight, which left him helpless alike of reproach  or resentment. He could not return the horses, although in a fit of  childish indignation he had resolved not to use them; he could not  reimburse him for the doctor's bill, although he had sent away the  nurse.    He took a foolish satisfaction in not moving back from the river, with a  faint hope that his ignoring of Captain Jack's advice might mysteriously  be conveyed to him. He even thought of selling out his location and  abandoning it, that he might escape the cold surveillance of his  heartless friend. All this was undoubtedly childish--but there is an  irrepressible simplicity of youth in all deep feeling, and the worldly  inexperience of the frontiersman left him as innocent as a child. In  this phase of his unrequited affection he even went so far as to seek  some news of Captain Jack at Sacramento, and, following out his foolish  quest, even to take the steamboat from thence to Stockton.    What happened to him then was perhaps the common experience of such  natures. Once upon the boat the illusion of the great world it contained  for him utterly vanished. He found it noisy, formal, insincere, and--had  he ever understood or used the word in his limited vocabulary--VULGAR.  Rather, perhaps, it seemed to him that the prevailing sentiment and  action of those who frequented it--and for whom it was built--were of a  lower grade than his own. And, strangely enough, this gave him none of  his former sense of critical superiority, but only of his own utter and  complete isolation. He wandered in his rough frontiersman's clothes from  deck to cabin, from airy galleries to long saloons, alone, unchallenged,  unrecognized, as if he were again haunting it only in spirit, as he had  so often done in his dreams.    His presence on the fringe of some voluble crowd caused no interruption;  to him their speech was almost foreign in its allusions to things he did  not understand, or, worse, seemed inconsistent with their eagerness and  excitement. How different from all this were his old recollections of  slowly oncoming teams, uplifted above the level horizon of the plains in  his former wanderings; the few sauntering figures that met him as man  to man, and exchanged the chronicle of the road; the record of Indian  tracks; the finding of a spring; the discovery of pasturage, with  the lazy, restful hospitality of the night! And how fierce here this  continual struggle for dominance and existence, even in this lull of  passage. For above all and through all he was conscious of the feverish  haste of speed and exertion.    The boat trembled, vibrated, and shook with every stroke of the  ponderous piston. The laughter of the crowd, the exchange of gossip and  news, the banquet at the long table, the newspapers and books in the  reading-room, even the luxurious couches in the staterooms, were all  dominated, thrilled, and pulsating with the perpetual throb of the demon  of hurry and unrest. And when at last a horrible fascination dragged him  into the engine room, and he saw the cruel relentless machinery at work,  he seemed to recognize and understand some intelligent but pitiless  Moloch, who was dragging this feverish world at its heels.    Later he was seated in a corner of the hurricane deck, whence he could  view the monotonous banks of the river; yet, perhaps by certain signs  unobservable to others, he knew he was approaching his own locality.  He knew that his cabin and clearing would be undiscernible behind the  fringe of willows on the bank, but he already distinguished the points  where a few cottonwoods struggled into a promontory of lighter foliage  beyond them. Here voices fell upon his ear, and he was suddenly aware  that two men had lazily crossed over from the other side of the boat,  and were standing before him looking upon the bank.    “It was about here, I reckon,” said one, listlessly, as if continuing a  previous lagging conversation, “that it must have happened. For it was  after we were making for the bend we've just passed that the deputy,  goin' to the stateroom below us, found the door locked and the window  open. But both men--Jack Despard and Seth Hall, the sheriff--weren't  to be found. Not a trace of 'em. The boat was searched, but all for  nothing. The idea is that the sheriff, arter getting his prisoner  comf'ble in the stateroom, took off Jack's handcuffs and locked the  door; that Jack, who was mighty desp'rate, bolted through the window  into the river, and the sheriff, who was no slouch, arter him.  Others allow--for the chairs and things was all tossed about in the  stateroom--that the two men clinched THAR, and Jack choked Hall and  chucked him out, and then slipped cl'ar into the water himself, for the  stateroom window was just ahead of the paddle box, and the cap'n allows  that no man or men could fall afore the paddles and live. Anyhow, that  was all they ever knew of it.”    “And there wasn't no trace of them found?” said the second man, after a  long pause.    “No. Cap'n says them paddles would hev' just snatched 'em and slung 'em  round and round and buried 'em way down in the ooze of the river bed,  with all the silt of the current atop of 'em, and they mightn't come up  for ages; or else the wheels might have waltzed 'em way up to Sacramento  until there wasn't enough left of 'em to float, and dropped 'em when the  boat stopped.”    “It was a mighty fool risk for a man like Despard to take,” resumed the  second speaker as he turned away with a slight yawn.    “Bet your life! but he was desp'rate, and the sheriff had got him sure!  And they DO say that he was superstitious, like all them gamblers, and  allowed that a man who was fixed to die by a rope or a pistol wasn't to  be washed out of life by water.”    The two figures drifted lazily away, but Morse sat rigid and motionless.  Yet, strange to say, only one idea came to him clearly out of this awful  revelation--the thought that his friend was still true to him--and that  his strange absence and mysterious silence were fully accounted for and  explained. And with it came the more thrilling fancy that this man was  alive now to HIM alone.    HE was the sole custodian of his secret. The morality of the question,  while it profoundly disturbed him, was rather in reference to its effect  upon the chances of Captain Jack and the power it gave his enemies than  his own conscience. He would rather that his friend should have proven  the proscribed outlaw who retained an unselfish interest in him than the  superior gentleman who was coldly wiping out his gratitude. He thought  he understood now the reason of his visitor's strange and varying  moods--even his bitter superstitious warning in regard to the probable  curse entailed upon one who should save a drowning man. Of this he  recked little; enough that he fancied that Captain Jack's concern in  his illness was heightened by that fear, and this assurance of his  protecting friendship thrilled him with pleasure.    There was no reason now why he should not at once go back to his farm,  where, at least, Captain Jack would always find him; and he did so,  returning on the same boat. He was now fully recovered from his illness,  and calmer in mind; he redoubled his labors to put himself in a position  to help the mysterious fugitive when the time should come. The remote  farm should always be a haven of refuge for him, and in this hope he  forbore to take any outside help, remaining solitary and alone, that  Captain Jack's retreat should be inviolate. And so the long, dry season  passed, the hay was gathered, the pasturing herds sent home, and the  first rains, dimpling like shot the broadening surface of the river,  were all that broke his unending solitude. In this enforced attitude of  waiting and expectancy he was exalted and strengthened by a new idea. He  was not a religious man, but, dimly remembering the exhortations of some  camp meeting of his boyhood, he conceived the idea that he might have  been selected to work out the regeneration of Captain Jack. What might  not come of this meeting and communing together in this lonely spot?  That anything was due to the memory of the murdered sheriff, whose bones  were rotting in the trench that he daily but unconcernedly passed, did  not occur to him. Perhaps his mind was not large enough for the double  consideration. Friendship and love--and, for the matter of that,  religion--are eminently one-ideaed.    But one night he awakened with a start. His hand, which was hanging out  of his bunk, was dabbling idly in water. He had barely time to spring  to his middle in what seemed to be a slowly filling tank before the door  fell out as from that inward pressure, and his whole shanty collapsed  like a pack of cards. But it fell outwards, the roof sliding from over  his head like a withdrawn canopy; and he was swept from his feet against  it, and thence out into what might have been another world! For the  rain had ceased, and the full moon revealed only one vast, illimitable  expanse of water! It was not an overflow, but the whole rushing river  magnified and repeated a thousand times, which, even as he gasped for  breath and clung to the roof, was bearing him away he knew not whither.  But it was bearing him away upon its center, for as he cast one swift  glance toward his meadows he saw they were covered by the same sweeping  torrent, dotted with his sailing hayricks and reaching to the wooded  foothills. It was the great flood of '54. In its awe-inspiring  completeness it might have seemed to him the primeval Deluge.    As his frail raft swept under a cottonwood he caught at one of the  overhanging limbs, and, working his way desperately along the bough, at  last reached a secure position in the fork of the tree. Here he was for  the moment safe. But the devastation viewed from this height was only  the more appalling. Every sign of his clearing, all evidence of his past  year's industry, had disappeared. He was now conscious for the first  time of the lowing of the few cattle he had kept as, huddled together  on a slight eminence, they one by one slipped over struggling into the  flood. The shining bodies of his dead horses rolled by him as he gazed.  The lower-lying limbs of the sycamore near him were bending with the  burden of the lighter articles from his overturned wagon and cabin which  they had caught and retained, and a rake was securely lodged in a bough.  The habitual solitude of his locality was now strangely invaded by  drifting sheds, agricultural implements, and fence rails from unknown  and remote neighbors, and he could faintly hear the far-off calling  of some unhappy farmer adrift upon a spar of his wrecked and shattered  house. When day broke he was cold and hungry.    Hours passed in hopeless monotony, with no slackening or diminution of  the waters. Even the drifts became less, and a vacant sea at last spread  before him on which nothing moved. An awful silence impressed him. In  the afternoon rain again began to fall on this gray, nebulous expanse,  until the whole world seemed made of aqueous vapor. He had but one idea  now--the coming of the evening boat, and he would reserve his strength  to swim to it. He did not know until later that it could no longer  follow the old channel of the river, and passed far beyond his sight and  hearing. With his disappointment and exposure that night came a return  of his old fever. His limbs were alternately racked with pain or  benumbed and lifeless. He could scarcely retain his position--at times  he scarcely cared to--and speculated upon ending his sufferings by a  quick plunge downward. In other moments of lucid misery he was conscious  of having wandered in his mind; of having seen the dead face of the  murdered sheriff, washed out of his shallow grave by the flood, staring  at him from the water; to this was added the hallucination of noises. He  heard voices, his own name called by a voice he knew--Captain Jack's!    Suddenly he started, but in that fatal movement lost his balance and  plunged downward. But before the water closed above his head he had had  a cruel glimpse of help near him; of a flashing light--of the black  hull of a tug not many yards away--of moving figures--the sensation of  a sudden plunge following his own, the grip of a strong hand upon his  collar, and--unconsciousness!    When he came to he was being lifted in a boat from the tug and rowed  through the deserted streets of a large city, until he was taken in  through the second-story window of a half-submerged hotel and cared  for. But all his questions yielded only the information that the  tug--a privately procured one, not belonging to the Public Relief  Association--had been dispatched for him with special directions, by a  man who acted as one of the crew, and who was the one who had plunged in  for him at the last moment. The man had left the boat at Stockton.  There was nothing more? Yes!--he had left a letter. Morse seized it  feverishly. It contained only a few lines:      We are quits now. You are all right. I have saved YOU from drowning, and  shifted the curse to my own shoulders. Good-by.    CAPTAIN JACK.      The astounded man attempted to rise--to utter an exclamation--but fell  back, unconscious.    Weeks passed before he was able to leave his bed--and then only as an  impoverished and physically shattered man. He had no means to restock  the farm left bare by the subsiding water. A kindly train-packer offered  him a situation as muleteer in a pack train going to the mountains--for  he knew tracks and passes and could ride. The mountains gave him back  a little of the vigor he had lost in the river valley, but none of its  dreams and ambitions. One day, while tracking a lost mule, he stopped  to slake his thirst in a waterhole--all that the summer had left of a  lonely mountain torrent. Enlarging the hole to give drink to his beast  also, he was obliged to dislodge and throw out with the red soil some  bits of honeycomb rock, which were so queer-looking and so heavy as to  attract his attention. Two of the largest he took back to camp with  him. They were gold! From the locality he took out a fortune. Nobody  wondered. To the Californian's superstition it was perfectly natural.  It was “nigger luck”--the luck of the stupid, the ignorant, the  inexperienced, the nonseeker--the irony of the gods!    But the simple, bucolic nature that had sustained itself against  temptation with patient industry and lonely self-concentration succumbed  to rapidly acquired wealth. So it chanced that one day, with a crowd of  excitement-loving spendthrifts and companions, he found himself on  the outskirts of a lawless mountain town. An eager, frantic crowd had  already assembled there--a desperado was to be lynched! Pushing his  way through the crowd for a nearer view of the exciting spectacle, the  changed and reckless Morse was stopped by armed men only at the foot of  a cart, which upheld a quiet, determined man, who, with a rope around  his neck, was scornfully surveying the mob, that held the other end  of the rope drawn across the limb of a tree above him. The eyes of the  doomed man caught those of Morse--his expression changed--a kindly smile  lit his face--he bowed his proud head for the first time, with an easy  gesture of farewell.    And then, with a cry, Morse threw himself upon the nearest armed guard,  and a fierce struggle began. He had overpowered one adversary and seized  another in his hopeless fight toward the cart when the half-astonished  crowd felt that something must be done. It was done with a sharp report,  the upward curl of smoke and the falling back of the guard as Morse  staggered forward FREE--with a bullet in his heart. Yet even then he did  not fall until he reached the cart, when he lapsed forward, dead, with  his arms outstretched and his head at the doomed man's feet.    There was something so supreme and all-powerful in this hopeless act  of devotion that the heart of the multitude thrilled and then recoiled  aghast at its work, and a single word or a gesture from the doomed  man himself would have set him free. But they say--and it is credibly  recorded--that as Captain Jack Despard looked down upon the hopeless  sacrifice at his feet his eyes blazed, and he flung upon the crowd a  curse so awful and sweeping that, hardened as they were, their blood ran  cold, and then leaped furiously to their cheeks.    “And now,” he said, coolly tightening the rope around his neck with a  jerk of his head--“Go on, and be damned to you! I'm ready.”    They did not hesitate this time. And Martin Morse and Captain Jack  Despard were buried in the same grave.          A CONVERT OF THE MISSION      The largest tent of the Tasajara camp meeting was crowded to its utmost  extent. The excitement of that dense mass was at its highest pitch. The  Reverend Stephen Masterton, the single erect, passionate figure of that  confused medley of kneeling worshipers, had reached the culminating  pitch of his irresistible exhortatory power. Sighs and groans were  beginning to respond to his appeals, when the reverend brother was seen  to lurch heavily forward and fall to the ground.    At first the effect was that of a part of his performance; the groans  redoubled, and twenty or thirty brethren threw themselves prostrate in  humble imitation of the preacher. But Sister Deborah Stokes, perhaps  through some special revelation of feminine intuition, grasped the  fallen man, tore loose his black silk necktie, and dragged him free  of the struggling, frantic crowd whose paroxysms he had just evoked.  Howbeit he was pale and unconscious, and unable to continue the service.  Even the next day, when he had slightly recovered, it was found that any  attempt to renew his fervid exhortations produced the same disastrous  result.    A council was hurriedly held by the elders. In spite of the energetic  protests of Sister Stokes, it was held that the Lord “was wrestlin' with  his sperrit,” and he was subjected to the same extraordinary treatment  from the whole congregation that he himself had applied to THEM. Propped  up pale and trembling in the “Mourners' Bench” by two brethren, he  was “striven with,” exhorted, prayed over, and admonished, until  insensibility mercifully succeeded convulsions. Spiritual therapeutics  having failed, he was turned over to the weak and carnal nursing of  “womenfolk.” But after a month of incapacity he was obliged to yield to  “the flesh,” and, in the local dialect, “to use a doctor.”    It so chanced that the medical practitioner of the district was a man  of large experience, of military training, and plain speech. When,  therefore, he one day found in his surgery a man of rude Western type,  strong-limbed and sunburned, but trembling, hesitating and neurotic in  movement, after listening to his symptoms gravely, he asked, abruptly:  “And how much are you drinking now?”    “I am a lifelong abstainer,” stammered his patient in quivering  indignation. But this was followed by another question so frankly  appalling to the hearer that he staggered to his feet.    “I'm Stephen Masterton--known of men as a circuit preacher, of the  Northern California district,” he thundered--“and an enemy of the flesh  in all its forms.”    “I beg your pardon,” responded Dr. Duchesne, grimly, “but as you are  suffering from excessive and repeated excitation of the nervous system,  and the depression following prolonged artificial exaltation--it makes  little difference whether the cause be spiritual, as long as there is a  certain physical effect upon your BODY--which I believe you have brought  to me to cure. Now--as to diet? you look all wrong there.    “My food is of the simplest--I have no hankering for fleshpots,”   responded the patient.    “I suppose you call saleratus bread and salt pork and flapjacks SIMPLE?”   said the doctor, coolly; “they are COMMON enough, and if you were  working with your muscles instead of your nerves in that frame of yours  they might not hurt you; but you are suffering as much from eating more  than you can digest as the veriest gourmand. You must stop all that. Go  down to a quiet watering-place for two months.” . . .    “I go to a watering-place?” interrupted Masterton; “to the haunt of the  idle, the frivolous and wanton--never!”    “Well, I'm not particular about a 'watering-place,'” said the doctor,  with a shrug, “although a little idleness and frivolity with different  food wouldn't hurt you--but you must go somewhere and change your habits  and mode of life COMPLETELY. I will find you some sleepy old Spanish  town in the southern country where you can rest and diet. If this is  distasteful to you,” he continued, grimly, “you can always call it 'a  trial.'”    Stephen Masterton may have thought it so when, a week later, he found  himself issuing from a rocky gorge into a rough, badly paved, hilly  street, which seemed to be only a continuation of the mountain road  itself. It broadened suddenly into a square or plaza, flanked on each  side by an irregular row of yellowing adobe houses, with the inevitable  verandaed tienda in each corner, and the solitary, galleried fonda, with  a half-Moorish archway leading into an inner patio or courtyard in the  center.    The whole street stopped as usual at the very door of the Mission  church, a few hundred yards farther on, and under the shadow of the two  belfry towers at each angle of the facade, as if this were the ultima  thule of every traveler. But all that the eye rested on was ruined,  worn, and crumbling. The adobe houses were cracked by the incessant  sunshine of the half-year-long summer, or the more intermittent  earthquake shock; the paved courtyard of the fonda was so uneven and  sunken in the center that the lumbering wagon and faded diligencia stood  on an incline, and the mules with difficulty kept their footing while  being unladen; the whitened plaster had fallen from the feet of the two  pillars that flanked the Mission doorway, like bandages from a gouty  limb, leaving the reddish core of adobe visible; there were apparently  as many broken tiles in the streets and alleys as there were on the  heavy red roofs that everywhere asserted themselves--and even seemed to  slide down the crumbling walls to the ground. There were hopeless gaps  in grille and grating of doorways and windows, where the iron bars had  dropped helplessly out, or were bent at different angles. The walls of  the peaceful Mission garden and the warlike presidio were alike lost in  the escalading vines or leveled by the pushing boughs of gnarled  pear and olive trees that now surmounted them. The dust lay thick and  impalpable in hollow and gutter, and rose in little vapory clouds with a  soft detonation at every stroke of his horse's hoofs. Over all this dust  and ruin, idleness seemed to reign supreme. From the velvet-jacketed  figures lounging motionless in the shadows of the open doorways--so  motionless that only the lazy drift of cigarette smoke betokened their  breathing--to the reclining peons in the shade of a catalpa, or the  squatting Indians in the arroyo--all was sloth and dirt.    The Rev. Stephen Masterton felt his throat swell with his old  exhortative indignation. A gaudy yellow fan waved languidly in front of  a black rose-crested head at a white-curtained window. He knew he was  stifling with righteous wrath, and clapped his spurs to his horse.    Nevertheless, in a few days, by the aid of a letter to the innkeeper,  he was installed in a dilapidated adobe house, not unlike those he had  seen, but situated in the outskirts and overlooking the garden and part  of the refectory of the old Mission. It had even a small garden of its  own--if a strip of hot wall, overburdened with yellow and white roses, a  dozen straggling callas, a bank of heliotrope, and an almond tree could  be called a garden. It had an open doorway, but so heavily recessed  in the thick walls that it preserved seclusion, a sitting-room, and an  alcoved bedroom with deep embrasured windows that however excluded the  unwinking sunlight and kept an even monotone of shade.    Strange to say, he found it cool, restful, and, in spite of the dust,  absolutely clean, and, but for the scent of heliotrope, entirely  inodorous. The dry air seemed to dissipate all noxious emanations and  decay--the very dust itself in its fine impalpability was volatile with  a spicelike piquancy, and left no stain.    A wrinkled Indian woman, brown and veined like a tobacco leaf,  ministered to his simple wants. But these wants had also been regulated  by Dr. Duchesne. He found himself, with some grave doubts of his  effeminacy, breakfasting on a single cup of chocolate instead of his  usual bowl of molasses-sweetened coffee; crumbling a crisp tortilla  instead of the heavy saleratus bread, greasy flapjack, or the lard-fried  steak, and, more wonderful still, completing his repast with purple  grapes from the Mission wall. He could not deny that it was simple--that  it was even refreshing and consistent with the climate and his  surroundings. On the other hand, it was the frugal diet of the commonest  peasant--and were not those peons slothful idolaters?    At the end of the week--his correspondence being also restricted by his  doctor to a few lines to himself regarding his progress--he wrote to  that adviser:    “The trembling and unquiet has almost ceased; I have less nightly  turmoil and visions; my carnal appetite seems to be amply mollified and  soothed by these viands, whatever may be their ultimate effect upon the  weakness of our common sinful nature. But I should not be truthful to  you if I did not warn you that I am viewing with the deepest spiritual  concern a decided tendency toward sloth, and a folding of the hands over  matters that often, I fear, are spiritual as well as temporal. I would  ask you to consider, in a spirit of love, if it be not wise to rouse my  apathetic flesh, so as to strive, even with the feeblest exhortations,  against this sloth in others--if only to keep one's self from falling  into the pit of easy indulgence.”    What answer he received is not known, but it is to be presumed that he  kept loyal faith with his physician, and gave himself up to simple walks  and rides and occasional meditation. His solitude was not broken in  upon; curiosity was too active a vice, and induced too much exertion for  his indolent neighbors, and the Americano's basking seclusion, though  unlike the habits of his countrymen, did not affect them. The shopkeeper  and innkeeper saluted him always with a profound courtesy which awakened  his slight resentment, partly because he was conscious that it was  grateful to him, and partly that he felt he ought to have provoked in  them a less satisfied condition.    Once, when he had unwittingly passed the confines of his own garden,  through a gap in the Mission orchard, a lissome, black-coated shadow  slipped past him with an obeisance so profound and gentle that he was  startled at first into an awkward imitation of it himself, and then into  an angry self-examination. He knew that he loathed that long-skirted,  womanlike garment, that dangling, ostentatious symbol, that air of  secrecy and mystery, and he inflated his chest above his loosely tied  cravat and unbuttoned waistcoat with a contrasted sense of freedom. But  he was conscious the next day of weakly avoiding a recurrence of this  meeting, and in his self-examination put it down to his self-disciplined  observance of his doctor's orders. But when he was strong again, and  fitted for his Master's work, how strenuously he should improve the  occasion this gave him of attacking the Scarlet Woman among her slaves  and worshipers!    His afternoon meditations and the perusal of his only book--the  Bible--were regularly broken in upon at about sunset by two or three  strokes from the cracked bell that hung in the open belfry which reared  itself beyond the gnarled pear tees. He could not say that it was  aggressive or persistent, like his own church bells, nor that it  even expressed to him any religious sentiment. Moreover, it was not a  “Sabbath” bell, but a DAILY one, and even then seemed to be only a signal  to ears easily responsive, rather than a stern reminder. And the hour  was always a singularly witching one.    It was when the sun had slipped from the glaring red roofs, and the  yellowing adobe of the Mission walls and the tall ranks of wild oats  on the hillside were all of the one color of old gold. It was when the  quivering heat of the arroyo and dusty expanse of plaza was blending  with the soft breath of the sea fog that crept through the clefts of the  coast range, until a refreshing balm seemed to fall like a benediction  on all nature. It was when the trade-wind-swept and irritated surfaces  of the rocky gorge beyond were soothed with clinging vapors; when the  pines above no longer rocked monotonously, and the great undulating sea  of the wild-oat plains had gone down and was at rest. It was at this  hour, one afternoon, that, with the released scents of the garden, there  came to him a strange and subtle perfume that was new to his senses. He  laid aside his book, went into the garden, and, half-unconscious of his  trespass, passed through the Mission orchard and thence into the little  churchyard beside the church.    Looking at the strange inscriptions in an unfamiliar tongue, he  was singularly touched with the few cheap memorials lying upon the  graves--like childish toys--and for the moment overlooked the papistic  emblems that accompanied them. It struck him vaguely that Death, the  common leveler, had made even the symbols of a faith eternal inferior to  those simple records of undying memory and affection, and he was for a  moment startled into doubt.    He walked to the door of the church; to his surprise it was open.  Standing upon the threshold, he glanced inside, and stood for a moment  utterly bewildered. In a man of refined taste and education that bizarre  and highly colored interior would have only provoked a smile or  shrug; to Stephen Masterton's highly emotional nature, but artistic  inexperience, strangely enough it was profoundly impressive. The heavily  timbered, roughly hewn roof, barred with alternate bands of blue and  Indian red, the crimson hangings, the gold and black draperies, affected  this religious backwoodsman exactly as they were designed to affect the  heathen and acolytes for whose conversion the temple had been reared. He  could scarcely take his eyes from the tinsel-crowned Mother of Heaven,  resplendent in white and gold and glittering with jewels; the radiant  shield before the Host, illuminated by tall spectral candles in the  mysterious obscurity of the altar, dazzled him like the rayed disk of  the setting sun.    A gentle murmur, as of the distant sea, came from the altar. In his  naive bewilderment he had not seen the few kneeling figures in the  shadow of column and aisle; it was not until a man, whom he recognized  as a muleteer he had seen that afternoon gambling and drinking in the  fonda, slipped by him like a shadow and sank upon his knees in the  center of the aisle that he realized the overpowering truth.    HE, Stephen Masterton, was looking upon some rite of Popish idolatry! He  was turning quickly away when the keeper of the tienda--a man of sloth  and sin--gently approached him from the shadow of a column with a mute  gesture, which he took to be one of invitation. A fierce protest of  scorn and indignation swelled to his throat, but died upon his lips. Yet  he had strength enough to erect his gaunt emaciated figure, throwing out  his long arms and extended palms in the attitude of defiant exorcism,  and then rush swiftly from the church. As he did so he thought he saw  a faint smile cross the shopkeeper's face, and a whispered exchange of  words with a neighboring worshiper of more exalted appearance came to  his ears. But it was not intelligible to his comprehension.    The next day he wrote to his doctor in that quaint grandiloquence of  written speech with which the half-educated man balances the slips of  his colloquial phrasing:      Do not let the purgation of my flesh be unduly protracted. What with the  sloth and idolatries of Baal and Ashteroth, which I see daily around  me, I feel that without a protest not only the flesh but the spirit is  mortified. But my bodily strength is mercifully returning, and I found  myself yesterday able to take a long ride at that hour which they here  keep sacred for an idolatrous rite, under the beautiful name of “The  Angelus.” Thus do they bear false witness to Him! Can you tell me the  meaning of the Spanish words “Don Keyhotter”? I am ignorant of these  sensuous Southern languages, and am aware that this is not the correct  spelling, but I have striven to give the phonetic equivalent. It was  used, I am inclined to think, in reference to MYSELF, by an idolater.    P.S.--You need not trouble yourself. I have just ascertained that  the words in question were simply the title of an idle novel, and, of  course, could not possibly refer to ME.      Howbeit it was as “Don Quixote”--that is, the common Spaniard's  conception of the Knight of La Mancha, merely the simple fanatic and  madman--that Mr. Stephen Masterton ever after rode all unconsciously  through the streets of the Mission, amid the half-pitying, half-smiling  glances of the people.    In spite of his meditations, his single volume, and his habit of  retiring early, he found his evenings were growing lonely and tedious.  He missed the prayer meeting, and, above all, the hymns. He had a fine  baritone voice, sympathetic, as may be imagined, but not cultivated. One  night, in the seclusion of his garden, and secure in his distance from  other dwellings, he raised his voice in a familiar camp-meeting hymn  with a strong Covenanter's ring in the chorus. Growing bolder as he went  on, he at last filled the quiet night with the strenuous sweep of his  chant. Surprised at his own fervor, he paused for a moment, listening,  half frightened, half ashamed of his outbreak. But there was only the  trilling of the night wind in the leaves, or the far-off yelp of a  coyote.    For a moment he thought he heard the metallic twang of a stringed  instrument in the Mission garden beyond his own, and remembered his  contiguity to the church with a stir of defiance. But he was relieved,  nevertheless. His pent-up emotion had found vent, and without the  nervous excitement that had followed his old exaltation. That night he  slept better. He had found the Lord again--with Psalmody!    The next evening he chanced upon a softer hymn of the same simplicity,  but with a vein of human tenderness in its aspirations, which his more  hopeful mood gently rendered. At the conclusion of the first verse  he was, however, distinctly conscious of being followed by the same  twanging sound he had heard on the previous night, and which even his  untutored ear could recognize as an attempt to accompany him. But before  he had finished the second verse the unknown player, after an ingenious  but ineffectual essay to grasp the right chord, abandoned it with  an impatient and almost pettish flourish, and a loud bang upon the  sounding-board of the unseen instrument. Masterton finished it alone.    With his curiosity excited, however, he tried to discover the locality  of the hidden player. The sound evidently came from the Mission garden;  but in his ignorance of the language he could not even interrogate  his Indian housekeeper. On the third night, however, his hymn was  uninterrupted by any sound from the former musician. A sense of  disappointment, he knew not why, came over him. The kindly overture of  the unseen player had been a relief to his loneliness. Yet he had barely  concluded the hymn when the familiar sound again struck his ears. But  this time the musician played boldly, confidently, and with a singular  skill on the instrument.    The brilliant prelude over, to his entire surprise and some confusion,  a soprano voice, high, childish, but infinitely quaint and fascinating,  was mischievously uplifted. But alas! even to his ears, ignorant of  the language, it was very clearly a song of levity and wantonness,  of freedom and license, of coquetry and incitement! Yet such was its  fascination that he fancied it was reclaimed by the delightful childlike  and innocent expression of the singer.    Enough that this tall, gaunt, broad-shouldered man arose and, overcome  by a curiosity almost as childlike, slipped into the garden and glided  with an Indian softness of tread toward the voice. The moon shone full  upon the ruined Mission wall tipped with clusters of dark foliage.  Half hiding, half mingling with one of them--an indistinct bulk of  light-colored huddled fleeces like an extravagant bird's nest--hung  the unknown musician. So intent was the performer's preoccupation that  Masterton actually reached the base of the wall immediately below the  figure without attracting its attention. But his foot slipped on the  crumbling debris with a snapping of dry twigs. There was a quick little  cry from above. He had barely time to recover his position before the  singer, impulsively leaning over the parapet, had lost hers, and fell  outward. But Masterton was tall, alert, and self-possessed, and threw  out his long arms. The next moment they were full of soft flounces,  a struggling figure was against his breast, and a woman's frightened  little hands around his neck. But he had broken her fall, and almost  instantly, yet with infinite gentleness, he released her unharmed, with  hardly her crisp flounces crumpled, in an upright position against  the wall. Even her guitar, still hanging from her shoulder by a yellow  ribbon, had bounded elastic and resounding against the wall, but lay  intact at her satin-slippered feet. She caught it up with another quick  little cry, but this time more of sauciness than fear, and drew her  little hand across its strings, half defiantly.    “I hope you are not hurt?” said the circuit preacher, gravely.    She broke into a laugh so silvery that he thought it no extravagance  to liken it to the moonbeams that played over her made audible. She was  lithe, yet plump; barred with black and yellow and small-waisted like  a pretty wasp. Her complexion in that light was a sheen of pearl satin  that made her eyes blacker and her little mouth redder than any other  color could. She was small, but, remembering the fourteen-year-old  wife of the shopkeeper, he felt that, for all her childish voice and  features, she was a grown woman, and a sudden shyness took hold of him.    But she looked pertly in his face, stood her guitar upright before her,  and put her hands behind her back as she leaned saucily against the wall  and shrugged her shoulders.    “It was the fault of you,” she said, in a broken English that seemed as  much infantine as foreign. “What for you not remain to yourself in your  own CASA? So it come. You creep so--in the dark--and shake my wall, and  I fall. And she,” pointing to the guitar, “is a'most broke! And for all  thees I have only make to you a serenade. Ingrate!”    “I beg your pardon,” said Masterton quickly, “but I was curious. I  thought I might help you, and--”    “Make yourself another cat on the wall, eh? No; one is enough, thank  you!”    A frown lowered on Masterton's brow. “You don't understand me,” he said,  bluntly. “I did not know WHO was here.”    “Ah, BUENO! Then it is Pepita Ramirez, you see,” she said, tapping her  bodice with one little finger, “all the same; the niece from Manuel  Garcia, who keeps the Mission garden and lif there. And you?”    “My name is Masterton.”    “How mooch?”    “Masterton,” he repeated.    She tried to pronounce it once or twice desperately, and then shook her  little head so violently that a yellow rose fastened over her ear fell  to the ground. But she did not heed it, nor the fact that Masterton had  picked it up.    “Ah, I cannot!” she said, poutingly. “It is as deefeecult to make go as  my guitar with your serenade.”    “Can you not say 'Stephen Masterton'?” he asked, more gently, with a  returning and forgiving sense of her childishness.    “Es-stefen? Ah, ESTEBAN! Yes; Don Esteban! BUENO! Then, Don Esteban,  what for you sink so melank-olly one night, and one night so fierce? The  melank-olly, he ees not so bad; but the fierce--ah! he is weeked! Ess it  how the Americano make always his serenade?”    Masterton's brow again darkened. And his hymn of exultation had been  mistaken by these people--by this--this wanton child!    “It was no serenade,” he replied, curtly; “it was in the praise of the  Lord!”    “Of how mooch?”    “Of the Lord of Hosts--of the Almighty in Heaven.” He lifted his long  arms reverently on high.    “Oh!” she said, with a frightened look, slightly edging away from the  wall. At a secure distance she stopped. “Then you are a soldier, Don  Esteban?”    “No!”    “Then what for you sink 'I am a soldier of the Lord,' and you will make  die 'in His army'? Oh, yes; you have said.” She gathered up her guitar  tightly under her arm, shook her small finger at him gravely, and said,  “You are a hoombog, Don Esteban; good a' night,” and began to glide  away.    “One moment, Miss--Miss Ramirez,” called Masterton. “I--that is you--you  have--forgotten your rose,” he added, feebly, holding up the flower. She  halted.    “Ah, yes; he have drop, you have pick him up, he is yours. I have drop,  you have pick ME up, but I am NOT yours. Good a' night, COMANDANTE Don  Esteban!”    With a light laugh she ran along beside the wall for a little distance,  suddenly leaped up and disappeared in one of the largest gaps in  its ruined and helpless structure. Stephen Masterton gazed after her  stupidly, still holding the rose in his hand. Then he threw it away and  re-entered his home.    Lighting his candle, he undressed himself, prayed fervently--so  fervently that all remembrance of the idle, foolish incident was wiped  from his mind, and went to bed. He slept well and dreamlessly. The next  morning, when his thoughts recurred to the previous night, this seemed  to him a token that he had not deviated from his spiritual integrity; it  did not occur to him that the thought itself was a tacit suspicion.    So his feet quite easily sought the garden again in the early sunshine,  even to the wall where she had stood. But he had not taken into account  the vivifying freshness of the morning, the renewed promise of life and  resurrection in the pulsing air and potent sunlight, and as he stood  there he seemed to see the figure of the young girl again leaning  against the wall in all the charm of her irrepressible and innocent  youth. More than that, he found the whole scene re-enacting itself  before him; the nebulous drapery half hidden in the foliage, the cry and  the fall; the momentary soft contact of the girl's figure against his  own, the clinging arms around his neck, the brush and fragrance of her  flounces--all this came back to him with a strength he had NOT felt when  it occurred.    He was turning hurriedly away when his eyes fell upon the yellow rose  still lying in the debris where he had thrown it--but still pure, fresh,  and unfaded. He picked it up again, with a singular fancy that it was  the girl herself, and carried it into the house.    As he placed it half shyly in a glass on his table a wonderful thought  occurred to him. Was not the episode of last night a special providence?  Was not that young girl, wayward and childlike, a mere neophyte in her  idolatrous religion, as yet unsteeped in sloth and ignorance, presented  to him as a brand to be snatched from the burning? Was not this  the opportunity of conversion he had longed for--this the chance of  exercising his gifts of exhortation that he had been hiding in the  napkin of solitude and seclusion? Nay, was not all this PREDESTINED?  His illness, his consequent exile to this land of false gods--this  contiguity to the Mission--was not all this part of a supremely ordered  plan for the girl's salvation--and was HE not elected and ordained for  that service? Nay, more, was not the girl herself a mere unconscious  instrument in the hands of a higher power; was not her voluntary attempt  to accompany him in his devotional exercise a vague stirring of that  predestined force within her? Was not even that wantonness and  frivolity contrasted with her childishness--which he had at first  misunderstood--the stirrings of the flesh and the spirit, and was he to  abandon her in that struggle of good and evil?    He lifted his bowed head, that had been resting on his arm before the  little flower on the table--as if it were a shrine--with a flash of  resolve in his blue eyes. The wrinkled Concepcion coming to her duties  in the morning scarcely recognized her gloomily abstracted master in  this transfigured man. He looked ten years younger.    She met his greeting, and the few direct inquiries that his new resolve  enabled him to make more freely, with some information--which a later  talk with the shopkeeper, who had a fuller English vocabulary, confirmed  in detail.    “YES! truly this was a niece of the Mission gardener, who lived with  her uncle in the ruined wing of the presidio. She had taken her first  communion four years ago. Ah, yes, she was a great musician, and could  play on the organ. And the guitar, ah, yes--of a certainty. She was gay,  and flirted with the caballeros, young and old, but she cared not for  any.”    Whatever satisfaction this latter statement gave Masterton, he believed  it was because the absence of any disturbing worldly affection would  make her an easier convert.    But how continue this chance acquaintance and effect her conversion?  For the first time Masterton realized the value of expediency; while his  whole nature impelled him to seek her society frankly and publicly and  exhort her openly, he knew that this was impossible; still more, he  remembered her unmistakable fright at his first expression of faith;  he must “be wise as the serpent and harmless as the dove.” He must work  upon her soul alone, and secretly. He, who would have shrunk from any  clandestine association with a girl from mere human affection, saw  no wrong in a covert intimacy for the purpose of religious salvation.  Ignorant as he was of the ways of the world, and inexperienced in the  usages of society, he began to plan methods of secretly meeting her with  all the intrigue of a gallant. The perspicacity as well as the intuition  of a true lover had descended upon him in this effort of mere spiritual  conquest.    Armed with his information and a few Spanish words, he took the  yellow Concepcion aside and gravely suborned her to carry a note to  be delivered secretly to Miss Ramirez. To his great relief and some  surprise the old woman grinned with intelligence, and her withered  hand closed with a certain familiar dexterity over the epistle and the  accompanying gratuity. To a man less naively one-ideaed it might  have awakened some suspicion; but to the more sanguine hopefulness of  Masterton it only suggested the fancy that Concepcion herself might  prove to be open to conversion, and that he should in due season attempt  HER salvation also. But that would be later. For Concepcion was always  with him and accessible; the girl was not.    The note, which had cost him some labor of composition, simple and  almost businesslike as was the result, ran as follows:    “I wish to see you upon some matter of grave concern to yourself. Will  you oblige me by coming again to the wall of the Mission tonight at  early candlelight? It would avert worldly suspicion if you brought also  your guitar.”    The afternoon dragged slowly on; Concepcion returned; she had, with  great difficulty, managed to see the senorita, but not alone; she had,  however, slipped the note into her hand, not daring to wait for an  answer.    In his first hopefulness Masterton did not doubt what the answer  would be, but as evening approached he grew concerned as to the girl's  opportunities of coming, and regretted that he had not given her a  choice of time.    Before his evening meal was finished he began to fear for her  willingness, and doubt the potency of his note. He was accustomed  to exhort ORALLY--perhaps he ought to have waited for the chance of  SPEAKING to her directly without writing.    When the moon rose he was already in the garden. Lingering at first in  the shadow of an olive tree, he waited until the moonbeams fell on  the wall and its crests of foliage. But nothing moved among that ebony  tracery; his ear was strained for the familiar tinkle of the guitar--all  was silent. As the moon rose higher he at last boldly walked to the  wall, and listened for any movement on the other side of it. But nothing  stirred. She was evidently NOT coming--his note had failed.    He was turning away sadly, but as he faced his home again he heard a  light laugh beside him. He stopped. A black shadow stepped out from  beneath his own almond tree. He started when, with a gesture that seemed  familiar to him, the upper part of the shadow seemed to fall away with a  long black mantilla and the face of the young girl was revealed.    He could see now that she was clad in black lace from head to foot. She  looked taller, older, and he fancied even prettier than before. A sudden  doubt of his ability to impress her, a swift realization of all the  difficulties of the attempt, and, for the first time perhaps, a dim  perception of the incongruity of the situation came over him.    “I was looking for you on the wall,” he stammered.    “MADRE DE DIOS!” she retorted, with a laugh and her old audacity, “you  would that I shall ALWAYS hang there, and drop upon you like a pear when  you shake the tree? No!”    “You haven't brought your guitar,” he continued, still more awkwardly,  as he noticed that she held only a long black fan in her hand.    “For why? You would that I PLAY it, and when my uncle say 'Where  go Pepita? She is loss,' someone shall say, 'Oh! I have hear her  tink-a-tink in the garden of the Americano, who lif alone.' And then--it  ess finish!”    Masterton began to feel exceedingly uncomfortable. There was something  in this situation that he had not dreamed of. But with the persistency  of an awkward man he went on.    “But you played on the wall the other night, and tried to accompany me.”    “But that was lass night and on the wall. I had not speak to you, you  had not speak to me. You had not sent me the leetle note by your peon.”   She stopped, and suddenly opening her fan before her face, so that only  her mischievous eyes were visible, added: “You had not asked me then to  come to hear you make lof to me, Don Esteban. That is the difference.”    The circuit preacher felt the blood rush to his face. Anger, shame,  mortification, remorse, and fear alternately strove with him, but  above all and through all he was conscious of a sharp, exquisite  pleasure--that frightened him still more. Yet he managed to exclaim:    “No! no! You cannot think me capable of such a cowardly trick?”    The girl started, more at the unmistakable sincerity of his utterance  than at the words, whose full meaning she may have only imperfectly  caught.    “A treek? A treek?” she slowly and wonderingly repeated. Then suddenly,  as if comprehending him, she turned her round black eyes full upon him  and dropped her fan from her face.    “And WHAT for you ask me to come here then?”    “I wanted to talk with you,” he began, “on far more serious matters.  I wished to--” but he stopped. He could not address this quaint  child-woman staring at him in black-eyed wonder, in either the measured  or the impetuous terms with which he would have exhorted a maturer  responsible being. He made a step toward her; she drew back, striking at  his extended hand half impatiently, half mischievously with her fan.    He flushed--and then burst out bluntly, “I want to talk with you about  your soul.”    “My what?”    “Your immortal soul, unhappy girl.”    “What have you to make with that? Are you a devil?” Her eyes grew  rounder, though she faced him boldly.    “I am a Minister of the Gospel,” he said, in hurried entreaty. “You must  hear me for a moment. I would save your soul.”    “My immortal soul lif with the Padre at the Mission--you moost seek her  there! My mortal BODY,” she added, with a mischievous smile, “say to  you, 'good a' night, Don Esteban.'” She dropped him a little curtsy  and--ran away.    “One moment, Miss Ramirez,” said Masterton, eagerly; but she had already  slipped beyond his reach. He saw her little black figure passing swiftly  beside the moonlit wall, saw it suddenly slide into a shadowy fissure,  and vanish.    In his blank disappointment he could not bear to re-enter the house he  had left so sanguinely a few moments before, but walked moodily in the  garden. His discomfiture was the more complete since he felt that  his defeat was owing to some mistake in his methods, and not the  incorrigibility of his subject.    Was it not a spiritual weakness in him to have resented so sharply the  girl's imputation that he wished to make love to her? He should have  borne it as Christians had even before now borne slander and false  testimony for their faith! He might even have ACCEPTED it, and let the  triumph of her conversion in the end prove his innocence. Or was his  purpose incompatible with that sisterly affection he had so often  preached to the women of his flock? He might have taken her hand, and  called her “Sister Pepita,” even as he had called Deborah “Sister.” He  recalled the fact that he had for an instant held her struggling in his  arms: he remembered the thrill that the recollection had caused him,  and somehow it now sent a burning blush across his face. He hurried back  into the house.    The next day a thousand wild ideas took the place of his former settled  resolution. He would seek the Padre, this custodian of the young girl's  soul; he would convince HIM of his error, or beseech him to give him  an equal access to her spirit! He would seek the uncle of the girl, and  work upon his feelings.    Then for three or four days he resolved to put the young girl from his  mind, trusting after the fashion of his kind for some special revelation  from a supreme source as an indication for his conduct. This revelation  presently occurred, as it is apt to occur when wanted.    One evening his heart leaped at the familiar sound of Pepita's guitar in  the",45.73,13.0,15.3,9.7,17.7,6.71,3627,6.555555555555555,17.03,6th and 7th grade
10,Over the Sliprailsr,"he was tired of seeing it stuck out in front  of him, so he took it, put it in his pocket, and sent the soap. This  must have discouraged them, for the borrowing industry petered out. He  saw the aunt later on, and she told him, cheerfully, that August was  going to live with a half-caste in a certain house in town.    Poor August! For she was only a tool after all. Her “romance” was  briefly as follows:--She went, per off-hand Maori arrangement, as  'housekeeper' in the hut of a labourer at a neighbouring saw-mill. She  stayed three months, for a wonder; at the expiration of which time she  put on her hat and explained that she was tired of stopping there, and  was going home. He said, 'All right, Sarah, wait a while and I'll take  you home.' At the door of her aunt's house he said, 'Well, good-bye,  Sarah,' and she said, in her brooding way, 'Good-bye, Jim.' And that was  all.    As the last apparent result of August's mischief-making, her brother  or someone one evening rode up to the cottage, drunk and inclined to  bluster. He was accompanied by a friend, also drunk, who came to see the  fun, and was ready to use his influence on the winning side. The teacher  went inside, brought out his gun, and slipped two cartridges in.  “I've had enough of this,” he said. “Now then, be off, you insolent  blackguards, or I'll shoot you like rabbits. Go!” and he snapped his jaw  and the breech of his gun together. As they rode off, the old local hawk  happened to soar close over a dead lamb in the fern at the corner of the  garden, and the teacher, who had been “laying” for him a long time, let  fly both barrels at him, without thinking. When he turned, there was  only a cloud of dust down the track.        .   .   .   .   .    The teacher taught that school for three years thereafter, without a  hitch. But he went no more on Universal Brotherhood lines. And, for  years after he had gone, his name was spoken of with great respect by  the Maoris.          New Year's Night        It was dark enough for anything in Dead Man's Gap--a round, warm, close  darkness, in which retreating sounds seemed to be cut off suddenly at a  distance of a hundred yards or so, instead of growing faint and fainter,  and dying away, to strike the ear once or twice again--and after  minutes, it might seem--with startling distinctness, before being  finally lost in the distance, as it is on clear, frosty nights. So with  the sounds of horses' hoofs, stumbling on the rough bridle-track through  the “saddle”, the clatter of hoof-clipped stones and scrape of gravel  down the hidden “siding”, and the low sound of men's voices, blurred  and speaking in monosyllables and at intervals it seemed, and in hushed,  awed tones, as though they carried a corpse. To practical eyes, grown  used to such a darkness, and at the nearest point, the passing blurrs  would have suggested two riders on bush hacks leading a third with an  empty saddle on its back--a lady's or “side-saddle”, if one could have  distinguished the horns. They may have struck a soft track or level, or  rounded the buttress of the hill higher up, but before they had time  to reach or round the foot of the spur, blurs, whispers, stumble and  clatter of hoofs, jingle of bridle rings, and the occasional clank  together of stirrup irons, seemed shut off as suddenly and completely as  though a great sound-proof door had swung to behind them.    It was dark enough on the glaringest of days down in the lonely hollow  or “pocket”, between two spurs, at the head of a blind gully behind  Mount Buckaroo, where there was a more or less dusty patch, barely  defined even in broad daylight by a spidery dog-legged fence on  three sides, and a thin “two-rail” (dignified with the adjective  “split-rail”--though rails and posts were mostly of saplings split in  halves) running along the frontage. In about the middle of it a little  slab hut, overshadowed by a big stringy-bark shed, was pointed out as  Johnny Mears's Farm.    “Black as--as charcoal,” said Johnny Mears. He had never seen coal, and  was a cautious man, whose ideas came slowly. He stooped, close by the  fence, with his hands on his knees, to “sky” the loom of his big shed  and so get his bearings. He had been to have a look at the penned  calves, and see that all slip-rails were up and pegged, for the words of  John Mears junior, especially when delivered rapidly and shrilly and in  injured tones, were not to be relied upon in these matters.    “It's hot enough to melt the belly out of my fiddle,” said Johnny Mears  to his wife, who sat on a three-legged stool by the rough table in the  little whitewashed “end-room”, putting a patch of patches over the seat  of a pair of moleskin knickerbockers. He lit his pipe, moved a stool  to the side of the great empty fireplace, where it looked cooler--might  have been cooler on account of a possible draught suggested by the  presence of the chimney, and where, therefore, he felt a breath  cooler. He took his fiddle from a convenient shelf, tuned it slowly and  carefully, holding his pipe (in his mouth) well up and to one side, as  if the fiddle were an inquisitive and restless baby. He played “Little  Drops o' Brandy” three times, right through, without variations,  blinking solemnly the while; then he put the violin carefully back in  its box, and started to cut up another pipeful.    “You should have gone, Johnny,” said the haggard little woman.    “Rackin' the horse out a night like this,” retorted Johnny, “and  startin' ploughin' to-morrow. It ain't worth while. Let them come for me  if they want me. Dance on a night like this! Why! they'll dance in----”    “But you promised. It won't do you no good, Johnny.”    “It won't do me no harm.”    The little woman went on stitching.    “It's smotherin' hot,” said Johnny, with an impatient oath. “I don't  know whether I'll turn in, or turn out, under the shed to-night. It's  too d----d hot to roost indoors.”    She bent her head lower over the patch. One smoked and the other  stitched in silence for twenty minutes or so, during which time Johnny  might be supposed to have been deliberating listlessly as to whether  he'd camp out on account of the heat, or turn in. But he broke the  silence with a clout at a mosquito on the nape of his neck, and a bad  word.    “I wish you wouldn't swear so much, Johnny,” she said wearily--“at least  not to-night.”    He looked at her blankly.    “Why--why to-night? What's the matter with you to-night, Mary? What's  to-night more than any other night to you? I see no harm--can't a man  swear when a mosquito sticks him?”    “I--I was only thinking of the boys, Johnny.”    “The boys! Why, they're both on the hay in the shed.” He stared at  her again, shifted uneasily, crossed the other leg tightly, frowned,  blinked, and reached for the matches. “You look a bit off-colour, Mary.  It's the heat that makes us all a bit ratty at times. Better put that by  and have a swill o' oatmeal and water, and turn in.”    “It's too hot to go to bed. I couldn't sleep. I'm all right. I'll--I'll  just finish this. Just reach me a drink from the water-bag--the  pannikin's on the hob there, by your boot.”    He scratched his head helplessly, and reached for the drink. When he  sat down again, he felt strangely restless. “Like a hen that didn't know  where to lay,” he put it. He couldn't settle down or keep still, and  didn't seem to enjoy his pipe somehow. He rubbed his head again.    “There's a thunderstorm comin',” he said. “That's what it is; and the  sooner it comes the better.”    He went to the back door, and stared at the blackness to the east, and,  sure enough, lightning was blinking there.    “It's coming, sure enough; just hang out and keep cool for another hour,  and you'll feel the difference.”    He sat down again on the three-legged stool, folded his arms, with his  elbows on his knees, drew a long breath, and blinked at the clay floor  for a while; then he twisted the stool round on one leg, until he faced  the old-fashioned spired wooden clock (the brass disc of the pendulum  moving ghost-like through a scarred and scratched marine scene--Margate  in England--on the glass that covered the lower half) that stood alone  on the slab shelf over the fireplace. The hands indicated half-past  two, and Johnny, who had studied that clock and could “hit the time nigh  enough by it,” after knitting his brows and blinking at the dial for a  full minute by its own hand, decided “that it must be getting on toward  nine o'clock.”    It must have been the heat. Johnny stood up, raking his hair, turned to  the door and back again, and then, after an impatient gesture, took up  his fiddle and raised it to his shoulder. Then the queer thing happened.  He said afterwards, under conditions favourable to such sentimental  confidence, that a cold hand seemed to take hold of the bow, through  his, and--anyway, before he knew what he was about he had played the  first bars of “When First I Met Sweet Peggy”, a tune he had played  often, twenty years before, in his courting days, and had never happened  to play since. He sawed it right through (the cold hand left after the  first bar or two) standing up; then still stood with fiddle and bow  trembling in his hands, with the queer feeling still on him, and a  rush of old thoughts going through his head, all of which he set down  afterwards to the effect of the heat. He put the fiddle away hastily,  damning the bridge of it at the same time in loud but hurried tones,  with the idea of covering any eccentricity which the wife might have  noticed in his actions. “Must 'a' got a touch o' sun,” he muttered  to himself. He sat down, fumbled with knife, pipe, and tobacco, and  presently stole a furtive glance over his shoulder at his wife.    The washed-out little woman was still sewing, but stitching blindly, for  great tears were rolling down her worn cheeks.    Johnny, white-faced on account of the heat, stood close behind her,  one hand on her shoulder and the other clenched on the table; but the  clenched hand shook as badly as the loose one.    “Good God! What is the matter, Mary? You're sick!” (They had had little  or no experience of illness.) “Tell me, Mary--come now! Has the boys  been up to anything?”    “No, Johnny; it's not that.”    “What is it then? You're taken sick! What have you been doing with  yourself? It might be fever. Hold up a minute. You wait here quiet while  I roost out the boys and send 'em for the doctor and someone----”    “No! no! I'm not sick, John. It's only a turn. I'll be all right in a  minute.”    He shifted his hand to her head, which she dropped suddenly, with a  life-weary sigh, against his side.    “Now then!” cried Johnny, wildly, “don't you faint or go into  disterricks, Mary! It'll upset the boys; think of the boys! It's only  the heat--you're only takin' queer.”    “It's not that; you ought to know me better than that. It  was--I--Johnny, I was only thinking--we've been married twenty years  to-night--an'--it's New Year's Night!”    “And I've never thought of it!” said Johnny (in the afterwards). “Shows  what a God-forgotten selection will make of a man. She'd thought of it  all the time, and was waiting for it to strike me. Why! I'd agreed to go  and play at a darnce at Old Pipeclay School-house all night--that very  night--and leave her at home because she hadn't asked to come; and  it never struck me to ask her--at home by herself in that hole--for  twenty-five bob. And I only stopped at home because I'd got the hump,  and knew they'd want me bad at the school.”    They sat close together on the long stool by the table, shy and awkward  at first; and she clung to him at opening of thunder, and they started  apart guiltily when the first great drops sounded like footsteps on the  gravel outside, just as they'd done one night-time before--twenty years  before.    If it was dark before, it was black now. The edge of the awful  storm-cloud rushed up and under the original darkness like the best  “drop” black-brushed over the cheap “lamp” variety, turning it grey by  contrast. The deluge lasted only a quarter of an hour; but it cleared  the night, and did its work. There was hail before it, too--big as emu  eggs, the boys said--that lay feet deep in the old diggers' holes on  Pipeclay for days afterwards--weeks some said.    The two sweethearts of twenty years ago and to-night watched the retreat  of the storm, and, seeing Mount Buckaroo standing clear, they went to  the back door, which opened opposite the end of the shed, and saw to the  east a glorious arch of steel-blue, starry sky, with the distant peaks  showing clear and blue away back under the far-away stars in the depth  of it.    They lingered awhile--arms round each other's waists--before she called  the boys, just as they had done this time of night twenty years ago,  after the boys' grandmother had called her.    “Awlright, mother!” bawled back the boys, with unfilial independence  of Australian youth. “We're awlright! We'll be in directly! Wasn't it a  pelterer, mother?”    They went in and sat down again. The embarrassment began to wear off.    “We'll get out of this, Mary,” said Johnny. “I'll take Mason's offer  for the cattle and things, and take that job of Dawson's, boss or no  boss”--(Johnny's bad luck was due to his inability in the past to “get  on” with any boss for any reasonable length of time)--“I can get the  boys on, too. They're doing no good here, and growing up. It ain't doing  justice to them; and, what's more, this life is killin' you, Mary. That  settles it! I was blind. Let the jumpt-up selection go! It's making a  wall-eyed bullock of me, Mary--a dry-rotted rag of a wall-eyed bullock  like Jimmy Nowlett's old Strawberry. And you'll live in town like a  lady.”    “Somebody coming!” yelled the boys.    There was a clatter of sliprails hurriedly thrown down, and clipped by  horses' hoofs.    “Insoide there! Is that you, Johnny?”    “Yes!” (“I knew they'd come for you,” said Mrs. Mears to Johnny.)    “You'll have to come, Johnny. There's no get out of it. Here's Jim  Mason with me, and we've got orders to stun you and pack you if you show  fight. The blessed fiddler from Mudgee didn't turn up. Dave Regan burst  his concertina, and they're in a fix.”    “But I can't leave the missus.”    “That's all right. We've got the school missus's mare and side-saddle.  She says you ought to be jolly well ashamed of yourself, Johnny Mears,  for not bringing your wife on New Year's Night. And so you ought!”    Johnny did not look shame-faced, for reasons unknown to them.    “The boys couldn't find the horses,” put in Mrs. Mears. “Johnny was just  going down the gully again.”    He gave her a grateful look, and felt a strange, new thrill of  admiration for his wife.    “And--there's a bottle of the best put by for you, Johnny,” added Pat  McDurmer, mistaking Johnny's silence; “and we'll call it thirty bob!”   (Johnny's ideas were coming slowly again, after the recent rush.)  “Or--two quid!--there you are!”    “I don't want two quid, nor one either, for taking my wife to a dance on  New Year's Night!” said Johnny Mears. “Run and put on your best bib and  tucker, Mary.”    And she hurried to dress as eager and excited, and smiling to herself  as girlishly as she had done on such occasions on evenings before the  bright New Year's Night twenty years ago.--For a related story, see “A  Bush Dance”, in “Joe Wilson and His Mates”.--A. L., 1998.--          Black Joe        They called him Black Joe, and me White Joe, by way of distinction and  for the convenience of his boss (my uncle), and my aunt, and mother; so,  when we heard the cry of “Bla-a-ack Joe!” (the adjective drawn out until  it became a screech, after several repetitions, and the “Joe” short  and sharp) coming across the flat in a woman's voice, Joe knew that the  missus wanted him at the house, to get wood or water, or mind the baby,  and he kept carefully out of sight; he went at once when uncle called.  And when we heard the cry of “Wh-i-i-te Joe!” which we did with  difficulty and after several tries--though Black Joe's ears were of the  keenest--we knew that I was overdue at home, or absent without leave,  and was probably in for a warming, as the old folk called it. On some  occasions I postponed the warming as long as my stomach held out, which  was a good while in five-corner, native-cherry, or yam season--but the  warming was none the cooler for being postponed.    Sometimes Joe heard the wrong adjective, or led me to believe he  did--and left me for a whole afternoon under the impression that the  race of Ham was in demand at the homestead, when I myself was wanted  there, and maternal wrath was increasing every moment of my absence.    But Joe knew that my conscience was not so elastic as his, and--well,  you must expect little things like this in all friendships.    Black Joe was somewhere between nine and twelve when I first met him,  on a visit to my uncle's station; I was somewhere in those years too.  He was very black, the darker for being engaged in the interesting but  uncertain occupation of “burning off” in his spare time--which wasn't  particularly limited. He combined shepherding, 'possum and kangaroo  hunting, crawfishing, sleeping, and various other occupations and  engagements with that of burning off. I was very white, being a sickly  town boy; but, as I took great interest in burning off, and was not  particularly fond of cold water--it was in winter time--the difference  in our complexions was not so marked at times.    Black Joe's father, old Black Jimmie, lived in a gunyah on the rise  at the back of the sheepyards, and shepherded for my uncle. He was a  gentle, good-humoured, easy-going old fellow with a pleasant smile;  which description applies, I think, to most old blackfellows in  civilisation. I was very partial to the old man, and chummy with him,  and used to slip away from the homestead whenever I could, and squat  by the campfire along with the other piccaninnies, and think, and  yarn socially with Black Jimmie by the hour. I would give something to  remember those conversations now. Sometimes somebody would be sent to  bring me home, when it got too late, and Black Jimmie would say:    “Piccaninnie alonga possum rug,” and there I'd be, sound asleep, with  the other young Australians.    I liked Black Jimmie very much, and would willingly have adopted him  as a father. I should have been quite content to spend my days in the  scrub, enjoying life in dark and savage ways, and my nights “alonga  possum rug”; but the family had other plans for my future.    It was a case of two blackfellows and one gin, when Black Jimmie went  a-wooing--about twelve years before I made his acquaintance--and he  fought for his bride in the black fashion. It was the last affair of  that kind in the district. My uncle's brother professed to have been  present at the fight, and gave me an alleged description of it. He said  that they drew lots, and Black Jimmie put his hands on his knees and  bent his head, and the other blackfellow hit him a whack on the skull  with a nulla nulla. Then they had a nip of rum all round--Black Jimmie  must have wanted it, for the nulla nulla was knotted, and heavy, and  made in the most approved fashion. Then the other blackfellow bent his  head, and Jimmie took the club and returned the whack with interest.  Then the other fellow hit Jimmie a lick, and took a clout in return.  Then they had another drink, and continued thus until Jimmie's rival  lost all heart and interest in the business. But you couldn't take  everything my uncle's brother said for granted.    Black Mary was a queen by right, and had the reputation of being  the cleanest gin in the district; she was a great favourite with the  squatters' wives round there. Perhaps she hoped to reclaim Jimmie--he  was royal, too, but held easy views with regard to religion and the  conventionalities of civilisation. Mary insisted on being married  properly by a clergyman, made the old man build a decent hut, had all  her children christened, and kept him and them clean and tidy up to the  time of her death.    Poor Queen Mary was ambitious. She started to educate her children,  and when they got beyond her--that is when they had learnt their  letters--she was grateful for any assistance from the good-natured bush  men and women of her acquaintance. She had decided to get her eldest boy  into the mounted police, and had plans for the rest, and she worked hard  for them, too. Jimmie offered no opposition, and gave her no assistance  beyond the rations and money he earned shepherding--which was as much as  could be expected of him.    He did as many husbands do “for the sake of peace and quietness”--he  drifted along in the wake of his wife, and took things as easily as her  schemes of reformation and education would allow him to.    Queen Mary died before her time, respected by all who knew or had heard  of her. The nearest squatter's wife sent a pair of sheets for a shroud,  with instructions to lay Mary out, and arranged (by bush telegraph) to  drive over next morning with her sister-in-law and two other white women  in the vicinity, to see Mary decently buried.    But the remnant of Jimmie's tribe were there beforehand. They tore the  sheets in strips and tied Mary up in a bundle, with her chin to her  knees--preparing her for burial in their own fashion--and mourned all  night in whitewash and ashes. At least, the gins did. The white women  saw that it was hopeless to attempt to untie any of the innumerable  knots and double knots, even if it had been possible to lay Mary out  afterwards; so they had to let her be buried as she was, with black and  white obsequies. And we've got no interest in believing that she did not  “jump up white woman” long ago.    My uncle and his brother took the two eldest boys. Black Jimmie  shifted away from the hut at once with the rest of his family--for the  “devil-devil” sat down there--and Mary's name was strictly “tabooed” in  accordance with aboriginal etiquette.    Jimmie drifted back towards the graves of his fathers in company with  a decreasing flock of sheep day by day (for the house of my uncle had  fallen on times of drought and depression, and foot-rot and wool rings,  and over-drafts and bank owners), and a few strips of bark, a dying  fire, a black pipe, some greasy 'possum rugs and blankets, a litter of  kangaroo tails, etc., four neglected piccaninnies, half a score of mangy  mongrels, and, haply, a “lilly drap o' rum”, by night.    The four little Australians grew dirtier and more shy and savage, and  ate underdone kangaroo and 'possum and native bear, with an occasional  treat of oak grubs and goanna by preference--and died out, one by  one, as blacks do when brought within the ever widening circle of  civilisation. Jimmie moved promptly after each death, and left the  evil one in possession, and built another mia-mia--each one being less  pretentious than the last. Finally he was left, the last of his tribe,  to mourn his lot in solitude.    But the devil-devil came and sat down by King Jimmie's side one night,  so he, too, moved out across the Old Man border, and the mia-mia rotted  into the ground and the grass grew there.        .   .   .   .   .    I admired Joe; I thought him wiser and cleverer than any white boy in  the world. He could smell out 'possums unerringly, and I firmly believed  he could see yards through the muddiest of dam water; for once, when I  dropped my boat in, and was not sure of the spot, he fished it out first  try. With cotton reels and bits of stick and bark he would make the  model of a station homestead, slaughter-yards, sheep-yards, and all  complete, working in ideas and improvements of his own which might  have been put into practice with advantage. He was a most original and  interesting liar upon all subjects upon which he was ignorant and  which came up incidentally. He gave me a very interesting account of an  interview between his father and Queen Victoria, and mentioned casually  that his father had walked across the Thames without getting wet.    He also told me how he, Joe, had tied a mounted trooper to a verandah  post and thrashed him with pine saplings until the timber gave out and  he was tired. I questioned Jimmie, but the incidents seemed to have  escaped the old king's memory.    Joe could build bigger woodheaps with less wood than any black or white  tramp or loafer round there. He was a born architect. He took a world  of pains with his wood-heaps--he built them hollow, in the shape of a  break-wind, with the convex side towards the house for the benefit of  his employers. Joe was easy-going; he had inherited a love of peace and  quietness from his father. Uncle generally came home after dark, and Joe  would have little fires lit at safe distances all round the house,  in order to convey an impression that the burning off was proceeding  satisfactorily.    When the warm weather came, Joe and I got into trouble with an old hag  for bathing in a waterhole in the creek in front of her shanty, and she  impounded portions of our wardrobe. We shouldn't have lost much if she  had taken it all; but our sense of injury was deep, especially as she  used very bad grammar towards us.    Joe addressed her from the safe side of the water. He said, “Look here!  Old leather-face, sugar-eye, plar-bag marmy, I call it you.”    “Plar-bag marmy” meant “Mother Flour-bag”, and ration sugar was  decidedly muddy in appearance.    She came round the waterhole with a clothes prop, and made good time,  too; but we got across and away with our clothes.    That little incident might have changed the whole course of my  existence. Plar-bag Marmy made a formal complaint to uncle, who happened  to pass there on horseback about an hour later; and the same evening  Joe's latest and most carefully planned wood heap collapsed while aunt  was pulling a stick out of it in the dark, and it gave her a bad scare,  the results of which might have been serious.    So uncle gave us a thrashing, without the slightest regard for racial  distinctions, and sent us to bed without our suppers.    We sought Jimmie's camp, but Joe got neither sympathy nor damper from  his father, and I was sent home with a fatherly lecture “for going  alonga that fella,” meaning Joe.    Joe and I discussed existence at a waterhole down the creek next  afternoon, over a billy of crawfish which we had boiled and a piece of  gritty damper, and decided to retire beyond the settled districts--some  five hundred miles or so--to a place that Joe said he knew of, where  there were lagoons and billabongs ten miles wide, alive with ducks and  fish, and black cockatoos and kangaroos and wombats, that only waited to  be knocked over with a stick.    I thought I might as well start and be a blackfellow at once, so we  got a rusty pan without a handle, and cooked about a pint of fat yellow  oak-grubs; and I was about to fall to when we were discovered, and the  full weight of combined family influence was brought to bear on the  situation. We had broken a new pair of shears digging out those grubs  from under the bark of the she-oaks, and had each taken a blade as his  own especial property, which we thought was the best thing to do under  the circumstances. Uncle wanted those shears badly, so he received us  with the buggy whip--and he didn't draw the colour line either. All  that night and next day I wished he had. I was sent home, and Joe went  droving with uncle soon after that, else I might have lived a life of  freedom and content and died out peacefully with the last of my adopted  tribe.    Joe died of consumption on the track. When he was dying uncle asked: “Is  there anything you would like?”    And Joe said: “I'd like a lilly drap o' rum, boss.”    Which were his last words, for he drank the rum and died peacefully.    I was the first to hear the news at home, and, being still a youngster,  I ran to the house, crying “Oh, mother! aunt's Joe is dead!”    There were visitors at our place at the time, and, as the eldest child  of the maternal aunt in question had also been christened Joe--after a  grandfather of our tribe (my tribe, not Black Joe's)--the news caused  a sudden and unpleasant sensation. But cross-examination explained the  mistake, and I retired to the rear of the pig-sty, as was my custom when  things went wrong, with another cause for grief.          They Wait on the Wharf in Black            “Seems to me that honest, hard-working men seem to accumulate          the heaviest swags of trouble in this world.”--Steelman.        Told by Mitchell's Mate.        We were coming back from West Australia, steerage--Mitchell, the Oracle,  and I. I had gone over saloon, with a few pounds in my pocket. Mitchell  said this was a great mistake--I should have gone over steerage with  nothing but the clothes I stood upright in, and come back saloon with a  pile. He said it was a very common mistake that men made, but, as far  as his experience went, there always seemed to be a deep-rooted popular  prejudice in favour of going away from home with a few pounds in one's  pocket and coming back stumped; at least amongst rovers and vagabonds  like ourselves--it wasn't so generally popular or admired at home, or in  the places we came back to, as it was in the places we went to. Anyway  it went, there wasn't the slightest doubt that our nearest and dearest  friends were, as a rule, in favour of our taking away as little as we  could possibly manage with, and coming back with a pile, whether we came  back saloon or not; and that ought to settle the matter as far as any  chap that had the slightest consideration for his friends or family was  concerned.    There was a good deal of misery, underneath, coming home in that  steerage. One man had had his hand crushed and amputated out Coolgardie  way, and the stump had mortified, and he was being sent to Melbourne by  his mates. Some had lost their money, some a couple of years of their  life, some their souls; but none seemed to have lost the heart to  call up the quiet grin that southern rovers, vagabonds, travellers for  “graft” or fortune, and professional wanderers wear in front of it  all. Except one man--an elderly eastern digger--he had lost his wife in  Sydney while he was away.    They sent him a wire to the Boulder Soak, or somewhere out back of  White Feather, to say that his wife was seriously ill; but the wire went  wrong, somehow, after the manner of telegrams not connected with mining,  on the lines of “the Western”. They sent him a wire to say that his wife  was dead, and that reached him all right--only a week late.    I can imagine it. He got the message at dinner-time, or when they came  back to the camp. His mate wanted him to sit in the shade, or lie in  the tent, while he got the billy boiled. “You must brace up and pull  yourself together, Tom, for the sake of the youngsters.” And Tom for  long intervals goes walking up and down, up and down, by the camp--under  the brassy sky or the gloaming--under the brilliant star-clusters that  hang over the desert plain, but never raising his eyes to them; kicking  a tuft of grass or a hole in the sand now and then, and seeming to watch  the progress of the track he is tramping out. The wife of twenty years  was with him--though two thousand miles away--till that message came.    I can imagine Tome sitting with his mates round the billy, they talking  in quiet, subdued tones about the track, the departure of coaches,  trains and boats--arranging for Tom's journey East, and the working of  the claim in his absence. Or Tom lying on his back in his bunk, with his  hands under his head and his eyes fixed on the calico above--thinking,  thinking, thinking. Thinking, with a touch of his boyhood's faith  perhaps; or wondering what he had done in his long, hard-working married  life, that God should do this thing to him now, of all times.    “You'd best take what money we have in the camp, Tom; you'll want it  all ag'in' the time you get back from Sydney, and we can fix it up  arterwards.... There's a couple o' clean shirts o' mine--you'd best take  'em--you'll want 'em on the voyage.... You might as well take them there  new pants o' mine, they'll only dry-rot out here--and the coat, too,  if you like--it's too small for me, anyway. You won't have any time in  Perth, and you'll want some decent togs to land with in Sydney.”        .   .   .   .   .    “I wouldn't 'a' cared so much if I'd 'a' seen the last of her,” he said,  in a quiet, patient voice, to us one night by the rail. “I would 'a'  liked to have seen the last of her.”    “Have you been long in the West?”    “Over two years. I made up to take a run across last Christmas, and have  a look at 'em. But I couldn't very well get away when 'exemption-time'  came. I didn't like to leave the claim.”    “Do any good over there?”    “Well, things brightened up a bit the last month or two. I had a hard  pull at first; landed without a penny, and had to send back every  shilling I could rake up to get things straightened up a bit at home.  Then the eldest boy fell ill, and then the baby. I'd reckoned on  bringing 'em over to Perth or Coolgardie when the cool weather came, and  having them somewheres near me, where I could go and have a look at 'em  now and then, and look after them.”    “Going back to the West again?”    “Oh, yes. I must go for the sake of the youngsters. But I don't seem  to have much heart in it.” He smoked awhile. “Over twenty years we  struggled along together--the missus and me--and it seems hard that I  couldn't see the last of her. It's rough on a man.”    “The world is damned rough on a man sometimes,” said Mitchell, “most  especially when he least deserves it.”    The digger crossed his arms on the rail like an old “cocky” at the fence  in the cool of the evening, yarning with an old crony.    “Mor'n twenty years she stuck to me and struggled along by my side. She  never give in. I'll swear she was on her feet till the last, with  her sleeves tucked up--bustlin' round.... And just when things was  brightening and I saw a chance of giving her a bit of a rest and comfort  for the end of her life.... I thought of it all only t'other week when  things was clearing up ahead; and the last 'order' I sent over I set  to work and wrote her a long letter, putting all the good news and  encouragement I could think of into it. I thought how that letter would  brighten up things at home, and how she'd read it round. I thought of  lots of things that a man never gets time to think of while his nose is  kept to the grindstone. And she was dead and in her grave, and I never  knowed it.”    Mitchell dug his elbow into my ribs and made signs for the matches to  light his pipe.    “An' yer never knowed,” reflected the Oracle.    “But I always had an idea when there was trouble at home,” the digger  went on presently, in his quiet, patient tone. “I always knowed; I  always had a kind of feeling that way--I felt it--no matter how far I  was away. When the youngsters was sick I knowed it, and I expected the  letter that come. About a fortnight ago I had a feeling that way when  the wife was ill. The very stars out there on the desert by the Boulder  Soak seemed to say: 'There's trouble at home. Go home. There's trouble  at home.' But I never dreamed what that trouble was. One night I did  make up my mind to start in the morning, but when the morning came I  hadn't an excuse, and was ashamed to tell my mates the truth. They might  have thought I was going ratty, like a good many go out there.” Then he  broke off with a sort of laugh, as if it just struck him that we  might think he was a bit off his head, or that his talk was getting  uncomfortable for us. “Curious, ain't it?” he said.    “Reminds me of a case I knowed,----” commenced the Oracle, after a  pause.    I could have pitched him overboard; but that was a mistake. He and the  old digger sat on the for'ard hatch half the night yarning, mostly about  queer starts, and rum go's, and curious cases the Oracle had knowed,  and I think the Oracle did him a lot of good somehow, for he seemed more  cheerful in the morning.    We were overcrowded in the steerage, but Mitchell managed to give up his  berth to the old digger without letting him know it. Most of the chaps  seemed anxious to make a place at the first table and pass the first  helpings of the dishes to the “old cove that had lost his missus.”    They all seemed to forget him as we entered the Heads; they had their  own troubles to attend to. They were in the shadow of the shame of  coming back hard up, and the grins began to grow faint and sickly. But I  didn't forget him. I wish sometimes that I didn't take so much notice of  things.    There was no mistaking them--the little group that stood apart near the  end of the wharf, dressed in cheap black. There was the eldest single  sister--thin, pale, and haggard-looking--that had had all the hard  worry in the family till her temper was spoilt, as you could see by the  peevish, irritable lines in her face. She had to be the mother of them  all now, and had never known, perhaps, what it was to be a girl or a  sweetheart. She gave a hard, mechanical sort of smile when she saw her  father, and then stood looking at the boat in a vacant, hopeless sort of  way. There was the baby, that he saw now for the first time, crowing and  jumping at the sight of the boat coming in; there was the eldest boy,  looking awkward and out of place in his new slop-suit of black, shifting  round uneasily, and looking anywhere but at his father. But the little  girl was the worst, and a pretty little girl she was, too; she never  took her streaming eyes off her father's face the whole time. You could  see that her little heart was bursting, and with pity for him. They were  too far apart to speak to each other as yet. The boat seemed a cruel  long long time swinging alongside--I wished they'd hurry up. He'd  brought his traps up early, and laid 'em on the deck under the rail; he  stood very quiet with his hands behind him, looking at his children. He  had a strong, square, workman's face, but I could see his chin and mouth  quivering under the stubbly, iron-grey beard, and the lump working in  his throat; and one strong hand gripped the other very tight behind, but  his eyelids never quivered--only his eyes seemed to grow more and more  sad and lonesome. These are the sort of long, cruel moments when a man  sits or stands very tight and quiet and calm-looking, with his whole  past life going whirling through his brain, year after year, and over  and over again. Just as the digger seemed about to speak to them he met  the brimming eyes of his little girl turned up to his face. He looked  at her for a moment, and then turned suddenly and went below as if  pretending to go down for his things. I noticed that Mitchell--who  hadn't seemed to be noticing anything in particular--followed him down.  When they came on deck again we were right alongside.    “'Ello, Nell!” said the digger to the eldest daughter.    “'Ello, father!” she said, with a sort of gasp, but trying to smile.    “'Ello, Jack, how are you getting on?”    “All right, father,” said the boy, brightening up, and seeming greatly  relieved.    He looked down at the little girl with a smile that I can't describe,  but didn't speak to her. She still stood with quivering chin and mouth  and great brimming eyes upturned, full of such pity as I never saw  before in a child-face--pity for him.    “You can get ashore now,” said Mitchell; “see, they've got the gangway  out aft.”    Presently I saw Mitchell with the portmanteau in his hand, and the baby  on his arm, steering them away to a quiet corner of the shed at the top  of the wharf. The digger had the little girl in his arms, and both hers  were round his neck, and her face hidden on his shoulder.    When Mitchell came back, he leant on the rail for a while by my side, as  if it was a boundary fence out back, and there was no hurry to break up  camp and make a start.    “What did you follow him below that time for, Mitchell?” I asked  presently, for want of something better to say.    Mitchell looked at me out of the corners of his eyes.    “I wanted to score a drink!” he said. “I thought he wanted one and  wouldn't like to be a Jimmy Woodser.”          Seeing the Last of You        “When you're going away by boat,” said Mitchell, “you ought to say  good-bye to the women at home, and to the chaps at the last pub. I hate  waiting on the wharf or up on deck when the boat's behind time. There's  no sense in it, and a lot of unnecessary misery. Your friends wait on  the wharf and you are kept at the rail to the bitter end, just when they  and you most want a spell. And why? Some of them hang out because they  love you, and want to see the last of you; some because they don't like  you to see them going away without seeing the last of you; and you hang  out mostly because it would hurt 'em if you went below and didn't give  them a chance of seeing the last of you all the time--and you curse the  boat and wish to God it would start. And those who love you most--the  women-folk of the family--and who are making all the fuss and breaking  their hearts about having to see the last of you, and least want to do  it--they hang out the longest, and are the most determined to see it.  Where's the sense in it? What's the good of seeing the last of you? How  do women manage to get consolation out of a thing like that?    “But women get consolation out of queer things sometimes,” he added  reflectively, “and so do men.    “I remember when I was knocking about the coasts, an old aunt of mine  always persisted in coming down to see the last of me, and bringing the  whole family too--no matter if I was only going away for a month. I was  her favourite. I always turned up again in a few months; but if I'd come  back every next boat it wouldn't have made the slightest difference to  her. She'd say that I mightn't come back some day, and then she'd never  forgive herself nor the family for not seeing me off. I suppose she'll  see the end of me yet if she lives long enough--and she's a wiry old  lady of the old school. She was old-fashioned and dressed like a fright,  they said at home. They hated being seen in public with her; to tell the  truth, I felt a bit ashamed, too, at times. I wouldn't be, now. When I'd  get her off on to the wharf I'd be overcome with my feelings, and have  to retire to the privacy of the bar to hide my emotions till the  boat was going. And she'd stand on the end of the pier and wave her  handkerchief and mop her old eyes with it until she was removed by  force.    “God bless her old heart! There wasn't so much affection wasted on me  at home that I felt crowded by hers; and I never lost anything by her  seeing the last of me.    “I do wish the Oracle would stop that confounded fiddle of his--it makes  you think over damned old things.”          Two Boys at Grinder Brothers'        Five or six half-grown larrikins sat on the cemented sill of the big  window of Grinder Bros.' Railway Coach Factory waiting for the work  bell, and one of the number was Bill Anderson--known as “Carstor  Hoil”--a young terror of fourteen or fifteen.    “Here comes Balmy Arvie,” exclaimed Bill as a pale, timid-looking little  fellow rounded the corner and stood against the wall by the door. “How's  your parents, Balmy?”    The boy made no answer; he shrank closer to the entrance. The first bell  went.    “What yer got for dinner, Balmy? Bread 'n' treacle?” asked the young  ruffian; then for the edification of his chums he snatched the boy's  dinner bag and emptied its contents on the pavement.    The door opened. Arvie gathered up his lunch, took his time-ticket, and  hurried in.    “Well, Balmy,” said one of the smiths as he passed, “what do you think  of the boat race?”    “I think,” said the boy, goaded to reply, “that it would be better if  young fellows of this country didn't think so much about racin' an'  fightin'.”    The questioner stared blankly for a moment, then laughed suddenly in the  boy's face, and turned away. The rest grinned.    “Arvie's getting balmier than ever,” guffawed young Bill.    “Here, Carstor Hoil,” cried one of the smiths' strikers, “how much oil  will you take for a chew of terbaccer?”    “Teaspoonful?”    “No, two.”    “All right; let's see the chew, first.”    “Oh, you'll get it. What yer frighten' of?... Come on, chaps, 'n' see  Bill drink oil.”    Bill measured out some machine oil and drank it. He got the tobacco, and  the others got what they called “the fun of seein' Bill drink oil!”    The second bell rang, and Bill went up to the other end of the shop,  where Arvie was already at work sweeping shavings from under a bench.    The young terror seated himself on the end of this bench, drummed his  heels against the leg, and whistled. He was in no hurry, for his foreman  had not yet arrived. He amused himself by lazily tossing chips at  Arvie, who made no protest for a while. “It would be--better--for this  country,” said the young terror, reflectively and abstractedly, cocking  his eye at the whitewashed roof beams and feeling behind him on the  bench for a heavier chip--“it would be better--for this country--if  young fellers didn't think so much about--about--racin'--AND fightin'.”    “You let me alone,” said Arvie.    “Why, what'll you do?” exclaimed Bill, bringing his eye down with  feigned surprise. Then, in an indignant tone, “I don't mind takin' a  fall out of yer, now, if yer like.”    Arvie went on with his work. Bill tossed all the chips within reach, and  then sat carelessly watching some men at work, and whistling the “Dead  March”. Presently he asked:    “What's yer name, Balmy?”    No answer.    “Carn't yer answer a civil question? I'd soon knock the sulks out of yer  if I was yer father.”    “My name's Arvie; you know that.”    “Arvie what?”    “Arvie Aspinall.”    Bill cocked his eye at the roof and thought a while and whistled; then  he said suddenly:    “Say, Balmy, where d'yer live?”    “Jones' Alley.”    “What?”    “Jones' Alley.”    A short, low whistle from Bill. “What house?”    “Number Eight.”    “Garn! What yer giv'nus?”    “I'm telling the truth. What's there funny about it? What do I want to  tell you a lie for?”    “Why, we lived there once, Balmy. Old folks livin'?”    “Mother is; father's dead.”    Bill scratched the back of his head, protruded his under lip, and  reflected.    “I say, Arvie, what did yer father die of?”    “Heart disease. He dropped down dead at his work.”    Long, low, intense whistle from Bill. He wrinkled his forehead and  stared up at the beams as if he expected to see something unusual there.  After a while he said, very impressively: “So did mine.”    The coincidence hadn't done striking him yet; he wrestled with it for  nearly a minute longer. Then he said:    “I suppose yer mother goes out washin'?”    “Yes.”    “'N' cleans offices?”    “Yes.”    “So does mine. Any brothers 'n' sisters?”    “Two--one brother 'n' one sister.”    Bill looked relieved--for some reason.    “I got nine,” he said. “Yours younger'n you?”    “Yes.”    “Lot of bother with the landlord?”    “Yes, a good lot.”    “Had any bailiffs in yet?”    “Yes, two.”    They compared notes a while longer, and tailed off into a silence which  lasted three minutes and grew awkward towards the end.    Bill fidgeted about on the bench, reached round for a chip, but  recollected himself. Then he cocked his eye at the roof once more and  whistled, twirling a shaving round his fingers the while. At last  he tore the shaving in two, jerked it impatiently from him, and said  abruptly:    “Look here, Arvie! I'm sorry I knocked over yer barrer yesterday.”    “Thank you.”    This knocked Bill out the first round. He rubbed round uneasily on  the bench, fidgeted with the vise, drummed his fingers, whistled, and  finally thrust his hands in his pockets and dropped on his feet.    “Look here, Arvie!” he said in low, hurried tones. “Keep close to me  goin' out to-night, 'n' if any of the other chaps touches yer or says  anything to yer I'll hit 'em!”    Then he swung himself round the corner of a carriage “body” and was  gone.        .   .   .   .   .    Arvie was late out of the shop that evening. His boss was a  sub-contractor for the coach-painting, and always tried to find twenty  minutes' work for his boys just about five or ten minutes before the  bell rang. He employed boys because they were cheap and he had a lot of  rough work, and they could get under floors and “bogies” with their pots  and brushes, and do all the “priming” and paint the trucks. His name was  Collins, and the boys were called “Collins' Babies”. It was a joke  in the shop that he had a “weaning” contract. The boys were all “over  fourteen”, of course, because of the Education Act. Some were nine or  ten--wages from five shillings to ten shillings. It didn't matter  to Grinder Brothers so long as the contracts were completed and the  dividends paid. Collins preached in the park every Sunday. But this has  nothing to do with the story.    When Arvie came out it was beginning to rain and the hands had all gone  except Bill, who stood with his back to a verandah-post, spitting with  very fair success at the ragged toe of one boot. He looked up, nodded  carelessly at Arvie, and then made a dive for a passing lorry, on the  end of which he disappeared round the next corner, unsuspected by the  driver, who sat in front with his pipe in his mouth and a bag over his  shoulders.    Arvie started home with his heart and mind pretty full, and a stronger,  stranger aversion to ever going back to the shop again. This new,  unexpected, and unsought-for friendship embarrassed the poor lonely  child. It wasn't welcome.    But he never went back. He got wet going home, and that night he was a  dying child. He had been ill all the time, and Collins was one “baby”   short next day.          The Selector's Daughter            I.    She rode slowly down the steep siding from the main road to a track in  the bed of the Long Gully, the old grey horse picking his way zig-zag  fashion. She was about seventeen, slight in figure, and had a pretty  freckled face with a pathetically drooping mouth, and big sad brown  eyes. She wore a faded print dress, with an old black riding skirt drawn  over it, and her head was hidden in one of those ugly, old-fashioned  white hoods, which, seen from the rear, always suggest an old woman.  She carried several parcels of groceries strapped to the front of the  dilapidated side-saddle.    The track skirted a chain of rocky waterholes at the foot of the gully,  and the girl glanced nervously at these ghastly, evil-looking pools as  she passed them by. The sun had set, as far as Long Gully was concerned.  The old horse carefully followed a rough bridle track, which ran up the  gully now on one side of the watercourse and now on the other; the gully  grew deeper and darker, and its sullen, scrub-covered sides rose more  steeply as he progressed.    The girl glanced round frequently, as though afraid of someone following  her. Once she drew rein, and listened to some bush sound. “Kangaroos,”   she murmured; it was only kangaroos. She crossed a dimmed little  clearing where a farm had been, and entered a thick scrub of box and  stringy-bark saplings. Suddenly with a heavy thud, thud, an “old man”   kangaroo leapt the path in front, startling the girl fearfully, and went  up the siding towards the peak.    “Oh, my God!” she gasped, with her hand on her heart.    She was very nervous this evening; her heart was hurt now, and she held  her hand close to it, while tears started from her eyes and glistened in  the light of the moon, which was rising over the gap ahead.    “Oh, if I could only go away from the bush!” she moaned.    The old horse plodded on, and now and then shook his head--sadly, it  seemed--as if he knew her troubles and was sorry.    She passed another clearing, and presently came to a small homestead in  a stringy-bark hollow below a great gap in the ridges--“Deadman's  Gap”. The place was called “Deadman's Hollow”, and looked like it.  The “house”--a low, two-roomed affair, with skillions--was built of  half-round slabs and stringy-bark, and was nearly all roof; the bark,  being darkened from recent rain, gave it a drearier appearance than  usual.    A big, coarse-looking youth of about twenty was nailing a green kangaroo  skin to the slabs; he was out of temper because he had bruised his  thumb. The girl unstrapped the parcels and carried them in; as she  passed her brother, she said:    “Take the saddle off for me, will you, Jack?”    “Oh, carnt yer take it off yerself?” he snarled; “carnt yer see I'm  busy?”    She took off the saddle and bridle, and carried them into a shed, where  she hung them on a beam. The patient old hack shook himself with an  energy that seemed ill-advised, considering his age and condition, and  went off towards the “dam”.    An old woman sat in the main room beside a fireplace which took up  almost the entire end of the house. A plank-table, supported on stakes  driven into the ground, stood in the middle of the room, and two slab  benches were fixtures on each side. The floor was clay. All was clean  and poverty-stricken; all that could be whitewashed was white, and  everything that could be washed was scrubbed. The slab shelves were  covered with clean newspapers, on which bright tins, and pannikins, and  fragments of crockery were set to the greatest advantage. The walls,  however, were disfigured by Christmas supplements of illustrated  journals.    The girl came in and sat down wearily on a stool opposite to the old  woman.    “Are you any better, mother?” she asked.    “Very little, Mary, very little. Have you seen your father?”    “No.”    “I wonder where he is?”    “You might wonder. What's the use of worrying about it, mother?”    “I suppose he's drinking again.”    “Most likely. Worrying yourself to death won't help it!”    The old woman sat and moaned about her troubles, as old women do. She  had plenty to moan about.    “I wonder where your brother Tom is? We haven't heard from him for a  year now. He must be in trouble again; something tells me he must be in  trouble again.”    Mary swung her hood off into her lap.    “Why do you worry about it, mother? What's the use?”    “I only wish I knew. I only wish I knew!”    “What good would that do? You know Tom went droving with Fred Dunn, and  Fred will look after him; and, besides, Tom's older now and got more  sense.”    “Oh, you don't care--you don't care! You don't feel it, but I'm his  mother, and----”    “Oh, for God's sake, don't start that again, mother; it hurts me more  than you think. I'm his sister; I've suffered enough, God knows! Don't  make matters worse than they are!”    “Here comes father!” shouted one of the children outside, “'n' he's  bringing home a steer.”    The old woman sat still, and clasped her hands nervously. Mary tried to  look cheerful, and moved the saucepan on the fire. A big, dark-bearded  man, mounted on a small horse, was seen in the twilight driving a steer  towards the cow-yard. A boy ran to let down the slip-rails.    Presently Mary and her mother heard the clatter of rails let down and  put up again, and a minute later a heavy step like the tread of a horse  was heard outside. The selector lumbered in, threw his hat in a  corner, and sat down by the table. His wife rose and bustled round with  simulated cheerfulness. Presently Mary hazarded--    “Where have you been, father?”    “Somewheers.”    There was a wretched silence, lasting until the old woman took courage  to say timidly:    “So you've brought a steer, Wylie?”    “Yes!” he snapped; the tone seemed defiant.    The old woman's hands trembled, so that she dropped a cup. Mary turned a  shade paler.    “Here, git me some tea. Git me some TEA!” shouted Mr. Wylie. “I ain't  agoin' to sit here all night!”    His wife made what haste her nervousness would allow, and they soon sat  down to tea. Jack, the eldest son, was sulky, and his father muttered  something about knocking the sulks out of him with an axe.    “What's annoyed you, Jack?” asked his mother, humbly.    He scowled and made no answer.    The younger children--three boys and a girl--began quarrelling as soon  as they sat down. Wylie yelled at them now and then, and grumbled at the  cooking, and at his wife for not being able to keep the children quiet.  It was: “Marther! you didn't put no sugar in my tea.” “Mother, Jimmy's  got my place; make him move.” “Mawther! do speak to this Fred.” “Oh!  father, this big brute of a Harry's kickin' me!” And so on.          II.    When the miserable meal was over, Wylie got a rope and a butcher's  knife, and went out to slaughter the steer; but first there was a row,  because he thought--or pretended to think--that somebody had been  using his knife. He lassoed the beast, drew it up to the rails, and  slaughtered it.    Meanwhile, Jack and his next brother took an old gun, let the dogs  loose, and went 'possum shooting.    Presently Wylie came in again, sat down by the fire, and smoked. The  children quarrelled over a boy's book; Mrs. Wylie made weak attempts  to keep the peace, but they took no notice of her. Suddenly her husband  rose with an oath, seized the novel, and threw it behind the fire.    “Git to bed! git to bed!” he roared at the children; “git to bed, or  I'll smash your brains with the axe!”    They got to bed. It was made of saplings and bark, covered with three  bushel-bags full of straw and old pieces of blanket sewn together. The  children quarrelled in bed till their father took off his belt and “went  into” them, according to promise. There was a sudden hush, followed by  a sound like a bird-clapper; then howls; then a peaceful calm fell upon  that happy home.    Wylie went out again, and was absent an hour; on his return he sat by  the fire and smoked sullenly. After a while he snatched the pipe from  his mouth, and looked impatiently at the old woman.    “Oh! for God's sake, git to bed,” he snapped, “and don't be asittin'  there like a blarsted funeral! You're enough to give a man the dismals.”    Mrs. Wylie gathered up her sewing and retired. Then he said to his  daughter: “You come and hold the candle.”    Mary put on her hood and followed her father to the yard. The carcase  lay close to the rails, against which two sheets of bark had been raised  as a break-wind. The beast had been partly skinned, and a portion of  the hide, where a brand might have been, was carefully turned back. Mary  noticed this at once. Her father went on with his work, and occasionally  grumbled at her for not holding the candle right.    “Where did you buy the steer, father?” she asked.    “Ask no questions and hear no lies.” Then he added, “Carn't you see it's  a clear skin?”    She had a keen sense of humour, and the idea of a “'clear skin' steer”   would have amused her at any other time. She didn't smile now.    He turned the carcase over; the loose hide fell back, and the light  shone on a distinct brand. White as a sheet went Mary's face, and her  hand trembled so that she nearly let the candle fall.    “What are you adoin' of now?” shouted her father. “Hold the candle,  carn't you? You're worse than the old woman.”    “Father! the beast is branded! See!---- What does PB stand for?”    “Poor Beggar, like myself. Hold the candle, carn't you?--and hold your  tongue.”    Mary was startled again by hearing the tread of a horse, but it was only  the old grey munching round. Her father finished skinning, and drew the  carcase up to a make-shift “gallows”. “Now you can go to bed,” he said,  in a gentler tone.    She went to her bedroom--a small, low, slab skillion, built on to the  end of the house--and fell on her knees by the bunk.    “God help me! God help us all!” she cried.    She lay down, but could not sleep. She was nervously ill--nearly mad,  because of the dark, disgraceful cloud of trouble which hung over her  home. Always in trouble--always in trouble. It started long ago, when  her favourite brother Tom ran away. She was little more than a child  then, intensely sensitive; and when she sat in the old bark school she  fancied that the other children were thinking or whispering to each  other, “Her brother's in prison! Mary Wylie's brother's in prison! Tom  Wylie's in gaol!” She was thinking of it still. They were ever with her,  those horrible days and nights of the first shadow of shame. She had the  same horror of evil, the same fearful dread of disgrace that her mother  had. She had been ambitious; she had managed to read much, and had wild  dreams of going to the city and rising above the common level, but that  was all past now.    How could she rise when the cruel hand of disgrace was ever ready to  drag her down at any moment. “Ah, God!” she moaned in her misery, “if  we could only be born without kin--with no one to disgrace us but  ourselves! It's cruel, God, it's cruel to suffer for the crimes of  others!” She was getting selfish in her troubles--like her mother. “I  want to go away from the bush and all I know.... O God, help me to  go away from the bush!” Presently she fell asleep--if sleep it may be  called--and dreamt of sailing away, sailing away far out on the sea  beyond the horizon of her dread. Then came a horrible nightmare, in  which she and all her family were arrested for a terrible crime. She  woke in a fright, and saw a reddish glare on the window. Her father  was poking round some logs where they had been “burning-off”. A pungent  odour came through a broken pane and turned her sick. He was burning the  hide.      Wylie did not go to bed that night; he got his breakfast before  daylight, and rode up through the frosty gap while the stars were still  out, carrying a bag of beef in front of him on the grey horse. Mary said  nothing about the previous night. Her mother wondered how much “father”   had given for the steer, and supposed he had gone into town to sell  the hide; the poor soul tried to believe that he had come by the steer  honestly. Mary fried some meat, and tried to eat it for her mother's  sake, but could manage only a few mouthfuls. Mrs. Wylie also seemed  to have lost her appetite. Jack and his brother, who had been out  all night, made a hearty breakfast. Then Jimmy started to peg out the  'possum skins, while Jack went to look for a missing pony. Mary was left  to milk all the cows, and feed the calves and pigs.      Shortly after dinner one of the children ran to the door, and cried:    “Why, mother--here's three mounted troopers comin' up the gully!”    “Oh, my God!” cried the mother, sinking back in her chair and trembling  like a leaf. The children ran and hid in the scrub. Mary stood up,  terribly calm, and waited. The eldest trooper dismounted, came to the  door, glanced suspiciously at the remains of the meal, and abruptly  asked the dreaded question:    “Mrs. Wylie, where's your husband?”    She dropped the tea-cup, from which she had pretended to be drinking  unconcernedly.    “What? Why, what do you want my husband for?” she asked in pitiful  desperation. SHE looked like the guilty party.    “Oh, you know well enough,” he sneered impatiently.    Mary rose and faced him. “How dare you talk to my mother like that?” she  cried. “If my poor brother Tom was only here--you--you coward!”    The youngest trooper whispered something to his senior, and then, stung  by a sharp retort, said:    “Well, you needn't be a pig.”    His two companions passed through into the spare skillion, where they  found some beef in a cask, and more already salted down under a bag on  the end of a bench; then they went out at the back and had a look at the  cow-yard. The younger trooper lingered behind.    “I'll try and get them up the gully on some excuse,” he whispered to  Mary. “You plant the hide before we come back.”    “It's too late. Look there!” She pointed through the doorway.    The other two were at the logs where the fire had been; the burning hide  had stuck to the logs in places like glue.    “Wylie's a fool,” remarked the old trooper.          III.    Jack disappeared shortly after his father's arrest on a charge of horse  and cattle-stealing, and Tom, the prodigal, turned up unexpectedly.  He was different from his father and eldest brother. He had an open  good-humoured face, and was very kind-hearted; but was subject to  peculiar fits of insanity, during which he did wild and foolish things  for the mere love of notoriety. He had two natures--one bright and  good, the other sullen and criminal. A taint of madness ran in the  family--came down from drunken and unprincipled fathers of dead  generations; under different conditions, it might have developed into  genius in one or two--in Mary, perhaps.    “Cheer up, old woman!” cried Tom, patting his mother on the back. “We'll  be happy yet. I've been wild and foolish, I know, and gave you some  awful trouble, but that's all done with. I mean to keep steady, and  by-and-bye we'll go away to Sydney or Queensland. Give us a smile,  mother.”    He got some “grubbing” to do, and for six months kept the family  in provisions. Then a change came over him. He became moody and  sullen--even brutal. He would sit for hours and grin to himself without  any apparent cause; then he would stay away from home for days together.    “Tom's going wrong again,” wailed Mrs. Wylie. “He'll get into trouble  again, I know he will. We are disgraced enough already, God knows.”    “You've done your best, mother,” said Mary, “and can do no more.  People will pity us; after all, the thing itself is not so bad as the  everlasting dread of it. This will be a lesson for father--he wanted  one--and maybe he'll be a better man.” (She knew better than that.) “YOU  did your best, mother.”    “Ah, Mary! you don't know what I've gone through these thirty years  in the bush with your father. I've had to go down on my knees and beg  people not to prosecute him--and the same with your brother Tom; and  this is the end of it.”    “Better to have let them go, mother; you should have left father when  you found out what sort of a man he was; it would have been better for  all.”    “It was my duty to stick by him, child; he was my husband. Your father  was always a bad man, Mary--a bad man; I found it out too late. I could  not tell you a quarter of what I have suffered with him.... I was proud,  Mary; I wanted my children to be better than others.... It's my fault;  it's a judgment.... I wanted to make my children better than others....  I was so proud, Mary.”    Mary had a sweetheart, a drover, who was supposed to be in Queensland.  He had promised to marry her, and take her and her mother away when he  returned; at least, she had promised to marry him on that condition. He  had now been absent on his latest trip for nearly six months, and there  was no news from him. She got a copy of a country paper to look for the  “stock passings”; but a startling headline caught her eye:                      IMPUDENT ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY UNDER ARMS.                                  ----         “A drover known to the police as Frederick Dunn, alias Drew,                    was arrested last week at----”      She read to the bitter end, and burned the paper. And the shadow of  another trouble, darker and drearier than all the rest, was upon her.    So the little outcast family in Long Gully existed for several months,  seeing no one save a sympathetic old splitter who would come and smoke  his pipe by the fire of nights, and try to convince the old woman that  matters might have been worse, and that she wouldn't worry so much if  she knew the troubles of some of our biggest families, and that things  would come out all right and the lesson would do Wylie good. Also, that  Tom was a different boy altogether, and had more sense than to go  wrong again. “It was nothing,” he said, “nothing; they didn't know what  trouble was.”    But one day, when Mary and her mother were alone, the troopers came  again.    “Mrs. Wylie, where's your son Tom?” they asked.    She sat still. She didn't even cry, “Oh, my God!”    “Don't be frightened, Mrs. Wylie,” said one of the troopers, gently. “It  ain't for much anyway, and maybe Tom'll be able to clear himself.”    Mary sank on her knees by her mother's side, crying “Speak to me,  mother. Oh, my God, she's dying! Speak for my sake, mother. Don't die,  mother; it's all a mistake. Don't die and leave me here alone.”    But the poor old woman was dead.        .   .   .   .   .    Wylie came out towards the end of the year, and a few weeks later he  brought home a--another woman.          IV.    Bob Bentley, general hawker, was camping under some rocks by the main  road, near the foot of Long Gully. His mate was fast asleep under the  tilted trap. Bob stood with his back to the fire, his pipe in his mouth,  and his hands clasped behind him. The fire lit up the undersides of the  branches above; a native bear sat in a fork blinking down at it, while  the moon above him showed every hair on his ears. From among the trees  came the pleasant jingle of hobble-chains, the slow tread of hoofs, and  the “crunch, crunch” at the grass, as the horses moved about and grazed,  now in moonlight, now in the soft shadows. “Old Thunder”, a big black  dog of no particular breed, gave a meaning look at his master, and  started up the ridge, followed by several smaller dogs. Soon Bob heard  from the hillside the “hy-yi-hi, whomp, whomp, whomp!” of old Thunder,  and the yop-yop-yopping of the smaller fry--they had tree'd a 'possum.  Bob threw himself on the grass, and pretended to be asleep. There was  a sound as of a sizeable boulder rolling down the hill, and presently  Thunder trotted round the fire to see if his master would come. Bob  snored. The dog looked suspiciously at him, trotted round once or twice,  and as a last resource gave him two great slobbery licks across the  face. Bob got up with a good-natured oath.    “Well, old party,” he said to Thunder, “you're a thundering old  nuisance; but I s'pose you won't be satisfied till I come.” He got a gun  from the waggonette, loaded it, and started up the ridge; old Thunder  rushing to and fro to show the way--as if the row the other dogs were  making wasn't enough to guide his master.    When Bob returned with the 'possums he was startled to see a woman in  the camp. She was sitting on a log by the fire, with her elbows on her  knees and her face in her hands.    “Why--what the dev--who are you?”    The girl raised a white desperate face to him. It was Mary Wylie.    “My father and--and the woman--they're drinking--they turned me out!  they turned me out.”    “Did they now? I'm sorry for that. What can I do for you?... She's mad  sure enough,” he thought to himself; “I thought it was a ghost.”    “I don't know,” she wailed, “I don't know. You're a man, and I'm a  helpless girl. They turned me out! My mother's dead, and my brothers  gone away. Look! Look here!” pointing to a bruise on her forehead. “The  woman did that. My own father stood by and saw it done--said it served  me right! Oh, my God!”    “What woman? Tell me all about it.”    “The woman father brought home!... I want to go away from the bush! Oh!  for God's sake take me away from the bush!... Anything! anything!--you  know!--only take me away from the bush!”    Bob and his mate--who had been roused--did their best to soothe her;  but suddenly, without a moment's warning, she sprang to her feet and  scrambled to the top of the rock overhanging the camp. She stood for a  moment in the bright moonlight, gazing intently down the vacant road.    “Here they come!” she cried, pointing down the road. “Here they  come--the troopers! I can see their cap-peaks glistening in  the moonlight!... I'm going away! Mother's gone. I'm going  now!--Good-bye!--Good-bye! I'm going away from the bush!”    Then she ran through the trees towards the foot of Long Gully. Bob and  his mate followed; but, being unacquainted with the locality, they lost  her.    She ran to the edge of a granite cliff on the higher side of the deepest  of the rocky waterholes. There was a heavy splash, and three startled  kangaroos, who had been drinking, leapt back and sped away, like three  grey ghosts, up the ridge towards the moonlit peak.          Mitchell on the “Sex” and Other “Problems”        “I agree with 'T' in last week's 'Bulletin',” said Mitchell, after  cogitating some time over the last drop of tea in his pannikin, held  at various angles, “about what they call the 'Sex Problem'. There's no  problem, really, except Creation, and that's not our affair; we can't  solve it, and we've no right to make a problem out of it for ourselves  to puzzle over, and waste the little time that is given us about. It's  we that make the problems, not Creation. We make 'em, and they only  smother us; they'll smother the world in the end if we don't look  out. Anything that can be argued, for and against, from half a dozen  different points of view--and most things that men argue over can  be--and anything that has been argued about for thousands of years (as  most things have) is worse than profitless; it wastes the world's time  and ours, and often wrecks old mateships. Seems to me the deeper you  read, think, talk, or write about things that end in ism, the less  satisfactory the result; the more likely you are to get bushed and  dissatisfied with the world. And the more you keep on the surface of  plain things, the plainer the sailing--the more comfortable for you and  everybody else. We've always got to come to the surface to breathe, in  the end, in any case; we're meant to live on the surface, and we might  as well stay there and look after it and ourselves for all the good we  do diving down after fish that aren't there, except in our imagination.  And some of 'em are very dead fish, too--the 'Sex Problem', for  instance. When we fall off the surface of the earth it will be time  enough to make a problem out of the fact that we couldn't stick on. I'm  a Federal Pro-trader in this country; I'm a Federalist because I think  Federation is the plain and natural course for Australia, and I'm a  Free-tectionist because I'm in favour of sinking any question, or any  two things, that enlightened people can argue and fight over, and try,  one after the other, for fifty years without being able to come to a  decision about, or prove which is best for the welfare of the country.  It only wastes a young country's time, and keeps it off the right track.  Federation isn't a problem--it's a plain fact--but they make a problem  out of every panel they have to push down in the rotten old boundary  fences.”    “Personal interests,” suggested Joe.    “Of course. It's personal interest of the wrong sort that makes all the  problems. You can trace the sex problem to people who trade in unhealthy  personal interests. I believe in personal interests of the right  sort--true individualism. If we all looked after ourselves, and our  wives and families--if we have any--in the proper way, the world would  be all right. We waste too much time looking after each other.    “Now, supposing we're travelling and have to get a shed and make a  cheque so's to be able to send a few quid home, as soon as we can, to  the missus, or the old folks, and the next water is twenty miles ahead.  If we sat down and argued over a social problem till doomsday, we  wouldn't get to the tank; we'd die of thirst, and the missus and kids,  or the old folks, would be sold up and turned out into the streets,  and have to fall back on a 'home of hope', or wait their turn at the  Benevolent Asylum with bags for broken victuals. I've seen that, and I  don't want anybody belonging to me to have to do it.    “Reminds me that when a poor, deserted girl goes to a 'home' they don't  make a problem of her--they do their best for her and try to get her  righted. And the priests, too: if there's anything in the sex or any  other problem--anything that hasn't been threshed out--they're the men  that'll know it. I'm not a Catholic, but I know this: that if a girl  that's been left by one--no matter what Church she belongs to--goes to  the priest, they'll work all the points they know (and they know 'em  all) to get her righted, and, if the chap, or his people, won't come up  to the scratch, Father Ryan'll frighten hell out of 'em. I can't say as  much for our own Churches.”    “But you're in favour of socialism and democracy?” asked Joe.    “Of course I am. But the world won't do any good arguing over it.  The people will have to get up and walk, and, what's more, stick  together--and I don't think they'll ever do that--it ain't in human  nature. Socialism, or democracy, was all right in this country till  it got fashionable and was made a fad or a problem of. Then it got  smothered pretty quick. And a fad or a problem always breeds a host of  parasites or hangers-on. Why, as soon as I saw the advanced idealist  fools--they're generally the middle-class, shabby-genteel families that  catch Spiritualism and Theosophy and those sort of complaints, at the  end of the epidemic--that catch on at the tail-end of things and think  they've caught something brand, shining, new;--as soon as I saw them,  and the problem spielers and notoriety-hunters of both sexes, beginning  to hang round Australian Unionism, I knew it was doomed. And so it was.  The straight men were disgusted, or driven out. There are women who hang  on for the same reason that a girl will sometimes go into the dock and  swear an innocent man's life away. But as soon as they see that the  cause is dying, they drop it at once, and wait for another. They come  like bloody dingoes round a calf, and only leave the bones. They're  about as democratic as the crows. And the rotten 'sex-problem' sort of  thing is the cause of it all; it poisons weak minds--and strong ones too  sometimes.    “Why, you could make a problem out of Epsom salts. You might argue as to  why human beings want Epsom salts, and try to trace the causes that  led up to it. I don't like the taste of Epsom salts--it's nasty in  the mouth--but when I feel that way I take 'em, and I feel better  afterwards; and that's good enough for me. We might argue that black is  white, and white is black, and neither of 'em is anything, and nothing  is everything; and a woman's a man and a man's a woman, and it's really  the man that has the youngsters, only we imagine it's the woman because  she imagines that she has all the pain and trouble, and the doctor is  under the impression that he's attending to her, not the man, and the  man thinks so too because he imagines he's walking up and down outside,  and slipping into the corner pub now and then for a nip to keep his  courage up, waiting, when it's his wife that's doing that all the time;  we might argue that it's all force of imagination, and that imagination  is an unknown force, and that the unknown is nothing. But, when we've  settled all that to our own satisfaction, how much further ahead are we?  In the end we'll come to the conclusion that we ain't alive, and never  existed, and then we'll leave off bothering, and the world will go on  just the same.”    “What about science?” asked Joe.    “Science ain't 'sex problems'; it's facts.... Now, I don't mind  Spiritualism and those sort of things; they might help to break the  monotony, and can't do much harm. But the 'sex problem', as it's written  about to-day, does; it's dangerous and dirty, and it's time to settle it  with a club. Science and education, if left alone, will look after sex  facts.    “You can't get anything out of the 'sex problem', no matter how you  argue. In the old Bible times they had half a dozen wives each, but we  don't know for certain how THEY got on. The Mormons tried it again, and  seemed to get on all right till we interfered. We don't seem to be able  to get on with one wife now--at least, according to the 'sex problem'.  The 'sex problem' troubled the Turks so much that they tried three. Lots  of us try to settle it by knocking round promiscuously, and that leads  to actions for maintenance and breach of promise cases, and all sorts of  trouble. Our blacks settle the 'sex problem' with a club, and so far I  haven't heard any complaints from them.        .   .   .   .   .    “Take hereditary causes and surrounding circumstances, for instance. In  order to understand or judge a man right, you would need to live under  the same roof with him from childhood, and under the same roofs, or  tents, with his parents, right back to Adam, and then you'd be blocked  for want of more ancestors through which to trace the causes that led  to Abel--I mean Cain--going on as he did. What's the use or sense of it?  You might argue away in any direction for a million miles and a million  years back into the past, but you've got to come back to where you are  if you wish to do any good for yourself, or anyone else.    “Sometimes it takes you a long while to get back to where you  are--sometimes you never do it. Why, when those controversies were  started in the 'Bulletin' about the kangaroos and other things, I  thought I knew something about the bush. Now I'm damned if I'm sure I  could tell a kangaroo from a wombat.    “Trying to find out things is the cause of all the work and trouble in  this world. It was Eve's fault in the first place--or Adam's, rather,  because it might be argued that he should have been master. Some men are  too lazy to be masters in their own homes, and run the show properly;  some are too careless, and some too drunk most of their time, and some  too weak. If Adam and Eve hadn't tried to find out things there'd have  been no toil and trouble in the world to-day; there'd have been no  bloated capitalists, and no horny-handed working men, and no politics,  no freetrade and protection--and no clothes. The woman next door  wouldn't be able to pick holes in your wife's washing on the line. We'd  have been all running about in a big Garden of Eden with nothing on, and  nothing to do except loaf, and make love, and lark, and laugh, and play  practical jokes on each other.”    Joe grinned.    “That would have been glorious. Wouldn't it, Joe? There'd have been no  'sex problem' then.”          The Master's Mistake        William Spencer stayed away from school that hot day, and “went  swimming”. The master wrote a note to William's father, and gave it to  William's brother Joe to carry home.    “You'll give that to your father to-night, Joseph.”    “Yes, sir.”    Bill waited for Joe near the gap, and walked home with him.    “I s'pose you've got a note for father.”    “Yes,” said Joe.    “I s'pose you know what's in it?”    “Ye--yes. Oh, why did you stop away, Bill?”    “You don't mean to say that you're dirty mean enough to give it to  father? Hey?”    “I must, Will. I promised the master.”    “He needn't never know.”    “Oh, yes, he will. He's coming over to our place on Saturday, and he's  sure to ask me to-morrow.”    Pause.    “Look here, Joe!” said Bill, “I don't want to get a hiding and go  without supper to-night. I promised to go 'possuming with Johnny  Nowlett, and he's going to give me a fire out of his gun. You can come,  too. I don't want to cop out on it to-night--if I do I'll run away from  home again, so there.”    Bill walked on a bit in moody, Joe in troubled, silence.    Bill tried again: he threatened, argued, and pleaded, but Joe was firm.  “The master trusted me, Will,” he said.    “Joe,” said Bill at last, after a long pause, “I wouldn't do it to you.”    Joe was troubled.    “I wouldn't do it to you, Joe.”    Joe thought how Bill had stood up and fought for him only last week.    “I'd tear the note in bits; I'd tell a hundred lies; I'd take a dozen  hidings first, Joe--I would.”    Joe was greatly troubled. His chest heaved, and the tears came to his  eyes.    “I'd do more than that for you, Joe, and you know it.”    Joe knew it. They were crossing the old goldfield now. There was a shaft  close to the path; it had fallen in, funnel-shaped, at the top, but was  still thirty or forty feet deep; some old logs were jammed across about  five feet down. Joe suddenly snatched the note from his pocket and threw  it in. It fluttered to the other side and rested on a piece of the old  timber. Bill saw it, but said nothing, and, seeing their father coming  home from work, they hurried on.    Joe was deep in trouble now. Bill tried to comfort and cheer him, but it  was no use. Bill promised never to run away from home any more, to go  to school every day, and never to fight, or steal, or tell lies. But Joe  had betrayed his trust for the first time in his life, and wouldn't be  comforted.    Some time in the night Bill woke, and found Joe sitting up in bed  crying.    “Why, what's the matter, Joe?”    “I never done a mean thing like that before,” sobbed Joe. “I wished I'd  chucked meself down the shaft instead. The master trusted me, Will; an'  now, if he asks me to-morrow, I'll have to tell a lie.”    “Then tell the truth, Joe, an' take the hidin'; it'll soon be over--just  a couple of cuts with the cane and it'll be all over.”    “Oh, no, it won't. He won't never trust me any more. I've never been  caned in that school yet, Will, and if I am I'll never go again. Oh! why  will you run away from home, Will, and play the wag, and steal, and  get us all into such trouble? You don't know how mother takes on about  it--you don't know how it hurts father! I've deceived the master, and  mother and father to-day, just because you're so--so selfish,” and he  laid down and cried himself to sleep.    Bill lay awake and thought till daylight; then he got up quietly, put on  his clothes, and stole away from the house and across the flat, followed  by the dog, who thought it was a 'possum-hunting expedition. Bill wished  the dog would not be quite so demonstrative, at least until they got  away from the house. He went straight to the shaft, let himself down  carefully on to one of the old logs, and stooped to pick up the note,  gleaming white in the sickly summer daylight. Then the rotten timber  gave way suddenly, without a moment's warning.        .   .   .   .   .    They found him that morning at about nine o'clock. The dog attracted  the attention of an old fossicker passing to his work. The letter was  gripped in Bill's right hand when they brought him up. They took him  home, and the father went for a doctor. Bill came to himself a little  just before the last, and said: “Mother! I wasn't running away,  mother--tell father that--I--I wanted to try and catch a 'possum on the  ground.... Where's Joe? I want Joe. Go out, mother, a minute, and send  Joe.”    “Here I am, Bill,” said Joe, in a choking, terrified voice.    “Has the master been yet?”    “No.”    “Bend down, Joe. I went for the note, and the logs gave way. I meant to  be back before they was up. I dropped it down inside the bed; you watch  your chance and get it; and say you forgot it last night--say you  didn't like to give it--that won't be a lie. Tell the master I'm--I'm  sorry--tell the master never to send no notes no more--except by  girls--that's all.... Mother! Take the blankets off me--I'm dyin'.”          The Story of the Oracle        “We young fellows,” said “Sympathy Joe” to Mitchell, after tea, in  their first camp west the river--“and you and I ARE young fellows,  comparatively--think we know the world. There are plenty of young chaps  knocking round in this country who reckon they've been through it  all before they're thirty. I've met cynics and men-o'-the-world, aged  twenty-one or thereabouts, who've never been further than a trip to  Sydney. They talk about 'this world' as if they'd knocked around in  half-a-dozen other worlds before they came across here--and they are  just as off-hand about it as older Australians are when they talk about  this colony as compared with the others. They say: 'My oath!--same  here.' 'I've been there.' 'My oath!--you're right.' 'Take it from me!'  and all that sort of thing. They understand women, and have a contemp",56.22,9.9,13.3,7.9,15.5,6.28,1070,8.5,15.4,9th and 10th grade
11,The Malefactorr,"I am tired of accepting so much and not being able to offer even  my thanks in return. It is too much like charity! I have made up my mind  that if this is to go on, I will go away and earn my own living! There,  Mr. Pengarth!”    “Rubbish!” he exclaimed briskly. “What at?”    “Painting!” she declared triumphantly. “I have had this in my mind for  some time, and I have been trying to see what I can do best. I have  quite decided, now, to be an artist.”    “Pictures,” he declared sententiously, “don’t sell!”    “Mine do,” she answered, smiling. “I have had a check for three guineas  from a shop in London for a little sea piece I did in two afternoons!”    He regarded her admiringly.    “You are a wonderful child!” he exclaimed.    “I am not a child at all,” she interrupted warmly, “and you can just sit  down and write to your silly client and tell him so.”    “I will certainly write to him,” he affirmed. “I will do so today. You  will not do anything rash until I have had time to get a reply?”    “No!” she answered graciously. “I will wait for a week. After  that--well, I might do anything!”    “You wouldn’t leave Tredowen, Miss Juliet!” he protested.    “It would break my heart, of course,” she declared, “but I would do it  and trust to time to heal it up again. Tredowen seems like home to me,  but it isn’t really, you know. Some day, Sir Wingrave Seton may want to  come back and live there himself. Are you quite certain, Mr. Pengarth,  that he won’t be angry to hear that we have been living at the house all  this time?”    “Certain,” Mr. Pengarth declared firmly. “He left everything entirely  in my hands. He did not wish me to let it, but he did not care about its  being altogether uninhabited. The arrangement I was able to make with  your guardian was a most satisfactory one.”    “But surely he will come back himself some time?” she asked,    The lawyer shook his head sorrowfully.    “I am afraid,” he said, “that Sir Wingrave has no affection for the  place whatever.”    “No affection for Tredowen,” she repeated wonderingly. “Do you know what  I think, Mr. Pengarth? I think that it is the most beautiful house in  the world!”    “And yet you talk of leaving it.”    “I don’t want to go,” she answered, “but I don’t want to be accepting  things all my life from someone whose name even I do not know.”    “Well, well,” he said, “you must wait until I have written my letter.  Time enough to talk about that later on. Now, if you won’t stay to  lunch, you must come and see Rachael and have some cake and a glass of  wine.”    “How sweet of you,” she exclaimed. “I’m frightfully hungry. Can I do  anything to stop growing, Mr. Pengarth? I’m getting taller and taller!”    She stood up. She was head and shoulders taller than the little lawyer,  slim as a lath, and yet wonderfully graceful. She laughed down at him  and made a little grimace.    “I’m a giraffe, am I not?” she declared; “and I’m still growing. Do show  me your garden, Mr. Pengarth. I want to see your hollyhocks. Everyone is  talking about them.”    They were joined in a few minutes by a prim, dignified little lady,  ridiculously like Mr. Pengarth, whom he called sister, and she Miss  Rachael. Juliet walked down the garden between them.    “Sister,” Mr. Pengarth said, “Juliet has come today to see me on  business. In effect, she has come to remind me that she is grown up.”    “Grown up,” Miss Rachael protested vigorously, “rubbish!”    “I am nineteen years old,” Juliet declared.    “And what if you are,” Miss Rachael replied briskly. “In my young days  we were in the nursery at nineteen.”    “Quite so,” Mr. Pengarth assented with relief. “You took me by storm  just now, Miss Juliet. After all, you are only a child.”    “I am old enough to feel and to mean all that I said to you, Mr.  Pengarth,” she answered gravely. “And that reminds me, too--there was  something else I meant to ask you.”    “Sister,” Mr. Pengarth said, “have you ordered the wine and the cake?”    “Bless me, no!” Miss Rachael declared. “It shall be ready in five  minutes.”    She entered the house. Mr. Pengarth stooped to pick some lavender.    “The only time I ever saw Sir Wingrave Seton,” she said, “was on the day  before I was told that a relation of my father had been found, who was  willing to take charge of me. There was a younger man with him, someone  very, very different from Sir Wingrave. Do you know who he was?”    “A sort of secretary of Sir Wingrave, I believe, dear. I never met him.  I was, unfortunately, away at the time they came.”    “He was very nice and kind to me,” the girl continued, “just as nice as  Sir Wingrave was horrid. I suppose it was because they came on that day,  but I have always connected him somehow with this mysterious relation of  mine. Mr. Aynesworth didn’t help to find him, did he?”    “Certainly not!” the lawyer answered. “The instructions I had came first  from Mr. Saunders, the vicar of the parish. It was he who appeared to  have made the necessary inquiries.”    “Horrid old man!” she declared. “He used to make me feel that I wanted  to cry every time that I saw him.”    “Miss Rachael is calling us,” the lawyer declared with obvious relief.    “New cake!” Juliet declared, “I can smell it! Delicious!”          LADY RUTH’S LAST CARD    “There are two letters,” Aynesworth announced, “which I have not opened.  One, I think, is from the Marchioness of Westhampton, the other from  some solicitors at Truro. They were both marked private.”    Wingrave was at breakfast in his flat; Aynesworth had been in an  adjoining room sorting his correspondence. He accepted the two letters,  and glanced them through without remark. But whereas he bestowed  scarcely a second’s consideration upon the broad sheet of white paper  with the small coronet and the faint perfume of violets, the second  letter apparently caused him some annoyance. He read it through for a  second time with a slight frown upon his forehead.    “You must cancel my engagements for two days, Aynesworth,” he said. “I  have to go out of town.”    Aynesworth nodded.    “There’s nothing very special on,” he remarked. “Do you want me to go  with you?”    “It is not necessary,” Wingrave answered. “I am going,” he added, after  a moment’s pause, “to Cornwall.”    Aynesworth was immediately silent. The one time when Wingrave had spoken  to him as an employer, was in answer to some question of his as to what  had eventually become of the treasures of Tredowen. He had always since  scrupulously avoided the subject.    “Be so good as to look out the trains for me,” Wingrave continued. “I  cannot go until the afternoon,” he added after a momentary pause. “I  have an engagement for luncheon. Perhaps, if you are not too busy, you  will see that Morrison packs some things for me.”    He moved to the writing table, and wrote a few lines to the Marchioness,  regretting that his absence from town would prevent his dining with  her on the following day. Then he studied the money column in several  newspapers for half an hour, and telephoned to his broker. At eleven  o’clock, he rode for an hour in the quietest part of the park, avoiding,  so far as possible, anyone he knew, and galloping whenever he could. It  was the only form of exercise in which he was known to indulge although  the knowledge of English games, which he sometimes displayed, was a  little puzzling to some of his acquaintances. On his return, he made  a simple but correct toilet, and at half-past one he met Lady Ruth at  Prince’s Restaurant.    Lady Ruth’s gown of dove color, with faint touches of blue, was  effective, and she knew it. Nevertheless, she was a little pale, and her  manner lacked that note of quiet languor which generally characterized  it. She talked rather more than usual, chattering idly about the  acquaintances to whom she was continually nodding and bowing. Her face  hardened a little as the Marchioness, on her way through the room with a  party of friends, stopped at their table.    The two women exchanged the necessary number of inanities, then the  Marchioness turned to Wingrave.    “You won’t forget that you are dining with me tomorrow?”    Wingrave shook his head regretfully.    “I am sorry,” he said, “but I have to go out of town. I have just  written you.”    “What a bore,” she remarked. “Business, of course!”    She nodded and passed on. Her farewell to Lady Ruth was distinctly curt.  Wingrave resumed his seat and his luncheon without remark.    “Hateful woman,” Lady Ruth murmured.    “I thought you were friends,” Wingrave remarked.    “Yes, we are,” Lady Ruth assented, “the sort of friendship you men don’t  know much about. You see a good deal of her, don’t you?”    Wingrave raised his head and looked at Lady Ruth contemplatively.    “Why do you ask me that?” he asked.    “Curiosity!”    “I do,” he remarked; “you should be grateful to her.”    “Why?”    “It may save you a similar infliction.”    Lady Ruth was silent for several moments.    “Perhaps,” she said at last, “I do not choose to be relieved.”    Wingrave bowed, his glass in his hand. His lips were curled into the  semblance of a smile, but he did not say a word. Lady Ruth leaned a  little across the table so that the feathers of her hat nearly brushed  his forehead.    “Wingrave,” she asked, “do you know what fear is? Perhaps not! You are  a man, you see. No one has ever called me a coward. You wouldn’t, would  you?”    “No!” he said deliberately, “you are not a coward.”    “There is only one sort of fear which I know,” she continued, “and that  is the fear of what I do not understand. And that is why, Wingrave, I am  afraid of you.”    He set down his glass, and his fingers trifled for a moment with its  stem. His expression was inscrutable.    “Surely,” he said, “you are not serious!”    “I am serious,” she declared, “and you know that I am.”    “You are afraid of me,” he repeated softly. “I wonder why.”    She looked him straight in the eyes.    “Because,” she said, “I did you once a very grievous wrong. Because I  know that you have not forgiven me. Because I am very sure that all the  good that was in you lies slain.”    “By whose hand?” he asked quietly. “No! You need not answer. You know.  So do I. Yes, I can understand your fear. But I do not understand why  you confess it to me.”    “Nor I,” she answered. “Nor do I understand why I am here--at your  bidding, nor why I keep you always by my side whenever you choose to  take your place there. Are you a vain man, Wingrave? Do you wish to pose  as the friend of a woman whom the world has thought too ambitious to  waste time upon such follies? There is the Marchioness! She would do you  more credit still.”    “Thank you,” he answered. “I like to choose the path myself when I pass  into the maze of follies!”    “You have not yet explained yourself,” she reminded him. “Of all people  in world, you have chosen us for your presumptive friends. Why? You  hate us both. You know that you do. Is it part of a scheme? Lumley is  investing money on your advice, I am allowing myself to be seen about  with you more than is prudent--considering all things. Do you want  to rake out the ashes of our domestic hearth--to play the part  of--melodramatic villain? You are ingenious enough, and powerful  enough.”    “You put strange ideas into my head,” he told her lightly. “Why should  I not play the part that you suggest? It might be amusing, and you  certainly deserve all the evil which I could bring upon you.”    She leaned a little across the table towards him. Her eyes were soft  and bright, and they looked full into his. The color in her cheeks was  natural. The air around him was faintly fragrant with the perfume of her  clothes and hair.    “We couldn’t leave off playing at the game--and act it, could we?” she  murmured. “We couldn’t really--be friends?”    Lady Ruth had played her trump card. She had touched his fingers with  hers, her eyes shone with the promise of unutterable things. But if  Wingrave was moved, he did not show it.    “I wish,” he said, “that I could accept your offer in the spirit  with which you tender it. Unfortunately, I am a maimed person. My  sensibilities have gone. Friendship, in the more intimate sense of  the word, I may never hope to feel again. Enmity--well, that is more  comprehensible; even enmity,” he continued slowly, “which might prompt a  woman to disguise herself as her own lady’s maid, to seek out a tool  to get rid of the man she feared. Pardon me, Lady Ruth, you are eating  nothing.”    She pulled down her veil.    “Thank you, I have finished,” she said in a low tone.    He called for the bill.    “Pray, don’t let my little remark distress you,” he said. “I had almost  forgotten the circumstance until something you said brought it into  my mind. It is you yourself, you must remember, who set the example of  candor.”    “I deserve everything you can say,” she murmured, “everything you can  do. There is nothing left, I suppose, but suffering. Will you take me  out to my carriage? You can come back and have your coffee with the  Marchioness! She keeps looking across at you, and it will please her to  think that you got rid of me.”    He glanced at his watch.    “I am afraid,” he said, rising, “that I must deny myself the pleasure of  seeking the Marchioness again today. I have a train to catch in half an  hour. You are ready?”    “Quite!”    They made their way through the maze of tables towards the door, Lady  Ruth exchanging greetings right and left with her friends, although the  tall, grave-looking man who followed her was by far the greater object  of interest.    “Just like Ruth to keep him in her pocket,” remarked her dearest friend,  looking after them; “they say that he has millions.”    She sighed a little enviously.    “The Barrington menage needs a little backing up,” her companion  remarked. “I should say that he had come just in time. The Marchioness  has her eye upon him too. There may be some fun presently.”    Lady Ruth’s dearest friend smiled.    “I will back Ruth,” she said drily. “Emily is beautiful, but she is too  obvious, and too eager! Ruth’s little ways are more subtle. Besides,  look at the start she has. She isn’t the sort of woman men tire of.”    Lady Ruth held out her hand through the window of her electric coupe.    “Thank you for my luncheon,” she said. “When shall we see you again?”    “In a few days,” he answered, standing bareheaded upon the pavement. “I  shall call directly I return.”    Lady Ruth nodded and leaned back. Wingrave smiled faintly as he turned  away. He had seen the little shudder which she had done her best to  hide!    Lady Ruth found her husband at home, writing letters in his study. She  sank wearily into a chair by his side.    “Been lunching out?” he inquired.    She nodded.    “At Prince’s, with Wingrave.”    He made no remark, but he seemed far from displeased.    “If I’d only had the pluck,” he remarked a little disconsolately, “I  might have made thousands by following his advice this week. It was you  who put me off, too!”    “It turned out all right?” she asked.    “Exactly as he said. I made five hundred! I might just as well have made  five thousand.”    “Can you let me have a couple of hundred?” she asked. “The people are  all bothering so.”    “You know that I can’t,” he answered irritably. “I had to send the lot  to Lewis, and then it wasn’t a quarter of what he is pressing for. We  shall never get through the season, Ruth, unless--”    She raised her eyes.    “Unless what?”    “Unless something turns up!”    There was a short, uncomfortable silence. Lady Ruth rose to her feet and  stood facing the fireplace with her back to him.    “Lumley,” she said, “let’s face it!”    He gave a little start.    “Face what?” he inquired.    “Ruin, the Bankruptcy Court, and all the rest of it!” she declared, a  note of defiance creeping into her tone.    Her husband’s face was white with astonishment. He stared across at her  blankly.    “Are you mad, Ruth?” he exclaimed. “Do you know what you are saying?”    “Quite well,” she answered. “I’m a little sick of the whole show. The  tradespeople are getting impertinent. I don’t even know where to get  flowers for dinner tonight or where to go for my Ascot gowns. It must  come sooner or later.”    “You’re talking like a fool,” he declared harshly. “Do you know that I  should have to give up my seat and my clubs?”    “We could live quietly in the country.”    “Country be--hanged!” he exclaimed savagely. “What use is the country to  you and me? I’d sooner put a bullet through my brain. Ruth, old lady,”   he added more gently, “what’s gone wrong? You’re generally such a well  plucked’un! Have you--had a row with Wingrave?” he asked, looking at her  anxiously.    “No!”    “Then what is it?”    “Nothing! I’ve lost my nerve, I suppose!”    “You want a change! It isn’t so very long to Cowes now and, thank  heavens, that’ll cost us nothing. We’re going on Wingrave’s yacht,  aren’t we?”    “Yes! We did accept.”    Barrington fidgeted for a moment with a paper knife.    “Ruth,” he asked, “what’s wrong between you and Wingrave?”    “Nothing,” she answered; “I’m afraid of him, that’s all!”    “Afraid of him! Afraid of Wingrave!” he repeated.    “Yes! I do not think that he has forgotten. I think that he means to  make us suffer.”    Barrington was almost dignified.    “I never heard such nonsense in my life, Ruth!” he exclaimed. “I have  watched Wingrave closely, and I have seen no trace of anything of  the sort. Nonsense! It is worse than nonsense! You must be getting  hysterical. You must get all this rubbish out of your head. To tell you  the truth--”    “Well?”    “I was thinking that you might ask Wingrave to help us a bit. I don’t  believe he’d hesitate for a moment.”    Ruth looked her husband in the face. There was a curious expression in  her eyes.    “Do you think that it would be wise of me to ask him?” she demanded.    “Why not?” he answered. “You can take care of yourself. I can trust  you.”    “I told you that I was afraid of Wingrave,” she reminded him. “I can  take care of myself as a rule--and I do--as you know. I have elected to  be one of the unfashionables in that respect. But to ask Wingrave for  money is more than I dare do.”    “Then I shall ask him myself,” Barrington declared.    She picked up her gloves and turned to leave the room.    “I should prefer even that,” she said.          GUARDIAN AND WARD    “Up to the present, then,” Wingrave remarked, “the child has no idea as  to who has been responsible for the charge of her?”    “No idea at all, Sir Wingrave,” the lawyer declared. “Your wishes have  been strictly carried out, most strictly. She imagines that it is some  unknown connection of her father. But, as I explained to you in my  letter, she has recently exhibited a good deal of curiosity in the  matter. She is--er--a young lady of considerable force of character for  her years, and her present attitude--as I explained in my letter--is a  trifle difficult.”    Wingrave was sitting in the lawyer’s own chair. Mr. Pengarth, who was a  trifle nervous, preferred to stand.    “She shows, I think, a certain amount of ingratitude in forcing this  journey and explanation upon me,” Wingrave declared coldly. “It should  have been sufficient for her that her benefactor preferred to remain  anonymous.”    “I regret, Sir Wingrave, that I must disagree with you,” Mr. Pengarth  answered boldly. “Miss Juliet, Miss Lundy I should say, is a young lady  of character--and--er--some originality of disposition. She is a great  favorite with everyone around here.”    Wingrave remained silent. He had the air of one not troubling to reply  to what he considered folly. Through the wide open window floated in the  various sounds of the little country town, the rumbling of heavy carts  passing along the cobbled streets, the shrill greetings of neighbors and  acquaintances meeting upon the sidewalk. And then the tinkling bell of a  rubber-tired cart pulling up outside, and a clear girlish voice speaking  to some one of the passers-by.    Wingrave betrayed as much surprise as it was possible for him to show  when at last she stood with outstretched hand before him. He had only an  imperfect recollection of an ill-clad, untidy-looking child, with pale  tear-stained cheeks, and dark unhappy eyes. The march of the years had  been a thing whose effects he had altogether underestimated. The girl  who stood now facing him was slight, and there was something of the  child left in her bright eager face, but she carried herself with all  the graceful assurance of an older woman. Her soft, dark eyes were  lit with pleasure and excitement, her delicately traced eyebrows and  delightful smile were somehow suggestive of her foreign descent. Her  clothes were country-made, but perfect as regarded fit and trimness,  her beflowered hat was worn with a touch of coquettish grace, a trifle  un-English, but very delightful. She had not an atom of shyness or  embarrassment. Only there was a great surprise in her face as she held  out her hands to Wingrave.    “I know who you are,” she exclaimed. “You are Sir Wingrave Seton. To  think that I never guessed.”    “You remember seeing me, then?” he remarked, and his tone sounded all  the colder after the full richness of her young voice.    “I just remember it--only just,” she answered. “You see you did not  take much notice of me that time, did you? But I have lived amongst your  ancestors too long to make any mistake. Why have you stayed away from  Tredowen so long?”    “I have been abroad,” Wingrave answered. “I am not fond of England.”    “You had trouble here, I know,” she said frankly. “But that is all past  and over. I think that you must forget how beautiful your home is or  you would never bear to live away from it. Now, please, may I ask you a  question?”    “Any that you think necessary,” Wingrave answered. “Spare me as much as  possible; I am not fond of them.”    “Shall I leave you two together for a little time?” Mr. Pengarth  suggested, gathering up some papers.    “Certainly not,” Wingrave said shortly. “There is not the slightest  necessity for it.”    Mr. Pengarth resumed his seat.    “Just as you please,” he answered. “But you must sit down, Juliet.  There, you shall have my clients’ chair.”    The girl accepted it with a little laugh. There was no shadow of  embarrassment about her manner, notwithstanding the cold stiffness of  Wingrave’s deportment. He sat where the sunlight fell across his chair,  and the lines in his pale face seemed deeper than usual, the grey hairs  more plentiful, the weariness in his eyes more apparent. Yet she was not  in the least afraid of him.    “First of all, then, Sir Wingrave, may I ask you why you have been so  extraordinarily kind to me?”    “There is nothing extraordinary about it at all,” he answered. “Your  father died and left you friendless in a parish of which I am Lord of  the Manor. He received a starvation pittance for his labors, which it  was my duty to augment, a duty which, with many others, I neglected. I  simply gave orders that you should be looked after.”    She laughed softly.    “Looked after! Why, I have lived at Tredowen. I have had a governess, a  pony to drive. Heaven knows how many luxuries!”    “That,” he interrupted hastily, “is nothing. The house is better  occupied. What I have done for you is less in proportion than the  sixpence you may sometimes have given to a beggar for I am a rich, a  ridiculously rich man, with no possible chance of spending one-quarter  of my income. You had a distinct and obvious claim upon me, and, at no  cost or inconvenience to myself, I have endeavored, through others, to  recognize it.”    “I will accept your view of the situation,” the girl said, still  smiling, but with a faint note of disappointment in her tone. “I do not  wish to force upon you expressions of gratitude which you would only  find wearisome. But I must thank you! It is in my heart, and I must  speak of it. There, it is over, you see! I shall say no more.”    “You are a sensible young lady,” Wingrave said, making a motion as  though to rise. “I have only one request to make to you, and that is  that you keep to yourself the knowledge which Mr. Pengarth informs me  that you insisted upon acquiring. You are nearly enough of age now, and  I will make you your own mistress. That is all, I think.”    The smile died away from her lips. Her tone became very earnest.    “Sir Wingrave,” she said, “for all that you have done for me, I am, as  you know grateful. I would try to tell you how grateful, only I know  that it would weary you. So we will speak only of the future. I cannot  continue to accept--even such magnificent alms as yours.”    “What do you mean, child?” he asked, frowning across at her.    “I mean,” she said, “that now I am old enough to work, I cannot accept  everything from one upon whom I have no claim. If you will help me a  little still, I shall be more than grateful. But it must be in my own  way.”    “You talk about work,” he said. “What can you do?”    “I can paint,” she answered, “fairly well. I should like to go to London  and have a few lessons. If I cannot make a living at that, I shall try  something else.”    “You disappoint me,” Wingrave said. “There is no place for you in  London. There are thousands starving there already because they can  paint a little, or sing a little, or fancy they can. Do you find it dull  down here?”    “Dull!” she exclaimed wonderingly. “I think that there can be no place  on earth so beautiful as Tredowen.”    “You are happy here?”    “Perfectly!”    “Then, for heaven’s sake, forget all this folly,” Wingrave said hardly.  “London is no place for children. Miss Harrison can take you up for a  month when you choose. You can go abroad if you want to. But for the  rest--”    She rose suddenly, and sweeping across the office with one graceful  movement, she leaned over Wingrave’s chair. Her hands rested upon  his shoulders, her eyes, soft with gathering tears, pleaded with his.  Wingrave sat with all the outward immobility of a Sphinx.    “Dear Sir Wingrave,” she said, “you have been so generous, so kind, and  I may not even speak of my gratitude. Don’t please think me unreasonable  or ungracious. I can’t tell you how I feel, but I must, I must, I must  go away. I could not live here any longer now that I know. Fancy for  a moment that I am your sister, or your daughter! Don’t you believe,  really, that she would feel the same? And I think you would wish her to.  Don’t be angry with me, please.”    Wingrave’s face never changed; but his fingers gripped the arms of his  chair so that a signet ring he wore cut deep into his flesh. When he  spoke, his tone sounded almost harsh. The girl turned away to dash the  tears from her eyes.    “What do you think of this--folly, Pengarth?”    The lawyer looked his best client squarely in the face. “I do not call  it folly, Sir Wingrave. I think that Miss Lundy is right.”    There was a pause. Her eyes were still pleading with him.    “Against the two of you,” Wingrave remarked, “I am, of course,  powerless. After all, it is no concern of mine. I shall leave you,  Pengarth, to make such arrangements as Miss Lundy desires!”    He rose to his feet. Juliet now was pale. She dashed the tears from her  eyes and looked at him in amazement mingled with something which was  almost like despair.    “You don’t mean,” she exclaimed, “you are going away without coming to  Tredowen?”    “Why not?” he asked. “I never had any intention of going there!”    “You are very angry with me,” she cried in despair. “I--I--”    Her lip quivered. Wingrave interposed.    “I shall be happy to go and have a look at the place,” he said  carelessly, “if you will drive me back. I fancy I have almost forgotten  what it is like.”    She looked at him as at one who had spoken irreverently. Her eyes were  full of wonder.    “I think that you must have indeed forgotten,” she said, “how very  beautiful it is. It is your home too! There is no one else,” she added  softly, “who can live there, amongst all those wonderful things, and  call it really--home!”    “I am afraid,” he said, “you will find that I have outlived all  sentiment; but I will certainly come to Tredowen with you!”          GHOSTS OF DEAD THINGS    “It was here,” she said, as they passed through the walled garden  seawards, “that I saw you first--you and the other gentleman who was so  kind to me.”    Wingrave nodded.    “I believe that I remember it,” he said; “you were a mournful-looking  object in a very soiled pinafore and most untidy hair.”    “I had been out on the cliffs,” she reminded him, “where I am taking you  now. If you are going to make unkind remarks about my hair, I think that  I had better fetch a hat.”    “Pray don’t leave me,” he answered. “I should certainly lose my way.  Your hair in those days was, I fancy, a little more--unkempt!”    She laughed.    “It used to be cut short,” she said. “Hideous! There! Isn’t that  glorious?”    She had opened the postern gate in the wall, and through the narrow  opening was framed a wonderful picture of the Cornish sea, rolling  into the rock-studded bay. Its soft thunder was in their ears; salt  and fragrant, the west wind swept into their faces. She closed the gate  behind her, and stepped blithely forward.    “Come!” she cried. “We will climb the cliffs where we left you alone  once before.”    Side by side they stood looking over the ocean. Her head was thrown  back, her lips a little parted. He watched her curiously.    “You must have sea blood in your veins,” he remarked. “You listen as  though you heard music all the time.”    “And what about you?” she asked him, smiling. “You are the grandson of  Admiral Sir Wingrave Seton who commanded a frigate at Trafalgar, and an  ancestor of yours fought in the Armada.”    “I am afraid,” he said quietly, “that there is a hiatus in my life  somewhere. There are no voices which call to me any more, and my family  records are so much dead parchment.”    Trouble passed into her glowing face and clouded her eyes.    “Ah!” she said, “I do not like to hear you talk so. Do you know that  when you do, you make me afraid that something I have always hoped for  will never come to pass?”    “What is it?” he asked.    “I have always hoped,” she said, “that some day you would come once more  to Tredowen. I suppose I am rather a fanciful person. This is a country  of superstitions and fancies, you know; but sometimes when I have been  alone in the picture gallery with all that long line of dark faces  looking down upon me from the walls, I have felt like an interloper.  Always they seem to be waiting! Tonight, after dinner, I will take you  there. I will try and show you what I mean.”    He shook his head.    “I shall never come back,” he said, “and there are no more of my name.”    She hesitated. When at last she spoke, the color was coming and going in  her cheeks.    “Sir Wingrave,” she said, “I am only an ignorant girl, and I have no  right to talk to you like this. Please be angry with me if you want to.  I deserve it. I know all about--that ten years! Couldn’t you forget it,  and come back? None of the country people round here, your own people,  believe anything evil about you. You were struck, and you struck back  again. A man would do that. You could be as lonely as you liked here,  or you could have friends if you wished for them. But this is the place  where you ought to live. You would be happier here, I believe, than in  exile. The love of it all would come back, you would never be lonely.  It is the same sea which sang to you when you were a child, and to your  fathers before you. It would bring you forgetfulness when you wanted it,  or--”    Wingrave interrupted her. His tone was cold, but not unkind.    “My dear young lady,” he said, “it is very good of you to be so  sympathetic, but I am afraid I am not at all the sort of person you  imagine me to be. What I was before those ten years--well, I have  forgotten. What I am now, I unfortunately know. I am a soured,  malevolent being whose only pleasure lies in the dealing out to others  some portion of the unhappiness which was dealt out to me.”    “I do not believe it,” she declared briskly.    He shrugged his shoulders.    “Nevertheless, it is true,” he declared coolly. “Listen! More or less  you interest me. I will tell you something which I have never yet  told to a single human being. I need not go into particulars. You will  probably believe a broad statement. My ten years’ imprisonment was more  or less an injustice!”    “Sir Wingrave!”    He checked her. There was not a tremor in his tone. The gesture with  which he had repelled her was stiff and emotionless.    “I went into prison one man, I came out another. While I live, I  shall never be able to think kindly again of a single one of my fellow  creatures. It was not my fault. So far as our affections are concerned,  we are machines, all of us. Well, my mainspring has broken.”    “I don’t believe it,” she declared.    “It is, nevertheless, true,” he affirmed calmly. “I am living in exile  because I have no friends, because friends have become an impossibility  to me. I shall not tell you any more of my life because you are young  and you would not believe me if I did. Some day,” he added grimly, “you  will probably hear for yourself.”    “I shall never believe anything,” she declared, “which I do not choose  to believe. I shall never believe, for instance, that you are quite what  you think yourself.”    “We will talk of other things,” he said. “Five years ago, you showed  Aynesworth where the seagulls built.”    “And now I will show you,” she exclaimed, “if you are sure that your  head is steady enough. Come along!”...    It was after dinner that she took him into the picture gallery. Miss  Harrison, very much disturbed by the presence of the master of Tredowen,  and still more so by the hint which she had already received as to  coming changes, followed them at a little distance.    “I am so sorry,” Juliet said, “that we have no cigars or cigarettes.”    “I seldom smoke,” Wingrave answered.    “If only we had had the slightest idea of your coming,” Miss Harrison  said for the tenth time, “we would have made more adequate preparations.  The wine cellar, at least, could have been opened. I allowed Mr. and  Mrs. Tresfarwin to go for their holiday only yesterday, and the cellars,  of course, are never touched.”    “Your claret was excellent,” Wingrave assured her.    “I am quite sure,” Miss Harrison said, “that claret from the local  grocer is not what you are accustomed to--”    “My dear madam,” Wingrave protested, “I seldom touch wine. Show me which  picture it is, Juliet, that you--ah!”    She had led him to the end of the gallery and stopped before what seemed  to be a plain oak cupboard surrounded by a massive frame. She looked at  him half fearfully.    “You want to see that picture?” he asked.    “If I might.”    He drew a bunch of keys from his pocket and calmly selected one. It was  a little rusty, but the cupboard turned at once on its hinges. A woman’s  face smiled down upon them, dark and splendid, from the glowing touch  of a great painter. Juliet studied it eagerly, and then stole a sidelong  glance at the man by her side. He was surveying it critically and  without any apparent emotion.    “Herkomer’s, I think,” he remarked. “Quite one of his best.”    “It is your mother?” she whispered.    He nodded.    “I’m not great at genealogy,” he said, “but I can go as far back as  that. She was by way of being a great lady, the daughter of the Duke of  Warminster.”    “You were an only son,” she said softly. “She must have been very fond  of you.”    “Customary thing, I suppose,” he remarked. “Lucky for her, under the  circumstances, that she died young.”    He closed the oaken door in front of the picture, and locked it.    “I should like to see the armory,” he said; “but I really forget--let me  see, it is at the end of the long gallery, isn’t it?”    She led him there without a word. She was getting a little afraid of  him. They inspected the library and wandered back into the picture  gallery. It was she, now, who was silent. She had shown him all her  favorite treasures without being able to evoke a single spark of  enthusiasm.    “Once,” she remarked, “we all had a terrible fright. We were told that  everything was going to be sold.”    He nodded.    “I did think of it,” he admitted; “but there seemed to be no hurry. All  these things are growing into money year by year. Some day I shall send  everything to Christie’s.”    She looked at him in horror.    “You cannot--oh, you cannot mean it?” she cried.    “Why not? They are no use to me.”    “No use?” she faltered.    “Not a bit. I don’t suppose I shall see them again for many years. And  the money--well, one can use that.”    “But I thought--that you were rich?” she faltered.    “So I am,” he answered, “and yet I go on making more and more, and I  shall go on. Money is the whip with which its possessor can scourge  humanity. It is with money that I deal out my--forgive me, I forgot that  I was talking aloud, and to a child,” he wound up suddenly.    She looked at him, dry-eyed, but with a strained look of sorrow  strangely altering her girlish face.    “You must be very unhappy,” she said.    “Not at all,” he assured her. “I am one of those fortunate persons  who have outlived happiness and unhappiness. I have nothing to do but  live--and pay off a few little debts.”    He rose directly afterwards, and she walked with him out to the gardens  whence a short cut led to the village.    “I have not tried again to make you change your mind,” he said as they  stood for a moment on the terrace. “If my wishes have any weight with  you, I trust that you will do nothing without consulting Mr. Pengarth.”    “And you--” she faltered, “are you--never in London? Sha’n’t I see you  again any time?”    “If you care to, by all means,” he answered. “Tell Mr. Pengarth to let  me have your address. Goodbye! Thank you for taking care of my treasures  so well.”    She held his cold hand in hers and suddenly raised it to her lips. Then  she turned away and hurried indoors.    Wingrave stood still for a moment and gazed at his hand through the  darkness as though the ghosts of dead things had flitted out from the  dark laurel shrubs. Then he laughed quietly to himself.          SPREADING THE NETS    “By the bye,” the Marchioness asked him, “have you a Christian name?”    “Sorry,” Wingrave answered, “if I ever had, I’ve forgotten it.”    “Then I must call you Wingrave,” she remarked. “I hate calling anyone I  know decently well Mr. anything.”    “Charmed,” Wingrave answered; “it isn’t a bad name.”    “It isn’t,” she admitted. “By the bye,” she continued, looking at him  critically, “you are rather a surprising person, aren’t you?”    “Glad you’ve found it out,” Wingrave answered. “I always thought so.”    “One associates all sorts of terrible things with  millionaires--especially African and American ones,” she remarked. “Now  you could pass anywhere for the ordinary sort of decent person.”    Wingrave nodded.    “I was told the other day,” he remarked reflectively, “that if I would  only cultivate two things, I might almost pass as a member of the  English aristocracy.”    “What were they?” she asked rashly.    “Ignorance and impertinence,” he answered.    The Marchioness was silent for a moment. There was a little more color  than usual in her beautiful cheeks and a dangerous glitter in her eyes.    “You can go home, Mr. Wingrave,” she said.    He rose to his feet imperturbably. The Marchioness stretched out a long  white hand and gently forced him back again.    “You mustn’t talk like that to me,” she said quietly. “I am sensitive.”    He bowed.    “A privilege, I believe, of your order,” he remarked.    “Of course, if you want to quarrel--” she began.    “I don’t,” he assured her.    “Then be sensible! I want to talk to you.”    “Sensible, alone with you!” he murmured. “I should establish a new  record.”    “You certainly aren’t in the least like a millionaire,” she declared,  smiling at him, “you are more like a--”    “Please go on,” he begged.    “I daren’t,” she answered, shaking her head.    “Then you aren’t in the least like a marchioness,” he declared. “At  least, not like our American ideas of one.”    She laughed outright.    “Bring your chair quite close to mine,” she ordered, “I really want to  talk to you.”    He obeyed, and affected to be absorbed in the contemplation of the  rings on the hand which a great artist had called the most beautiful in  England. She withdrew it a little peevishly, after a moment’s pause.    “I want to talk about the Barringtons,” she said. “Do you know that they  are practically ruined?”    “I heard that Barrington had been gambling on the Stock Exchange the  last few days,” he answered.    “He has lost a great deal of money,” she answered, “and they were almost  on their last legs before. Are you going to set them straight again?”    “No idea,” he answered. “I haven’t been asked, for one thing.”    “Ruth will ask you, of course,” the Marchioness said impatiently. “I  expect that she is waiting at your flat by now. I want to know whether  you are going to do it.”    The hand was again very close to his. Again Wingrave contemplated the  rings.    “I forgot that you were her friend, and are naturally anxious,” he  remarked.    “I am not her friend,” the Marchioness answered, “and--I do not wish you  to help them.”    Wingrave was silent. The hand was insistent, and he held it for a moment  lightly, and then let it go.    “Well, I don’t know,” he said doubtfully. “The Barringtons have been  very hospitable to me.”    “Rubbish!” the Marchioness answered. “You have done quite enough for  them already. Of course, you are a man--and you must choose. I am sure  that you understand me.”    He rose to his feet.    “I must think this out,” he said. “The Barringtons have a sort of claim  on me. I will let you know which way I decide.”    She stood close to him, and her hand fell upon his shoulder.    “You are not going!” she exclaimed. “I have told them that I am at home  to no one, and I thought that you would stay and entertain me. Sit down  again, Wingrave!”    “Sorry,” he answered, “I have a lot to do this afternoon. I came  directly I had your note; but I have had to keep some other people  waiting.”    “You are going to see Lady Ruth!”    “Not that I know of,” he declared. “I have heard nothing from her. By  the bye, I lost some money to you at bridge the other evening. How much  was it? Do you remember?”    She looked at him for a second, and turned away.    “Do you really want to know?” she asked.    “If you please. Put the amount down on a piece of paper, and then I  sha’n’t forget it.”    She crossed the room to her desk, and returned with a folded envelope.  He stuffed it into his waistcoat pocket.    “I shall be at the opera tonight,” she said. “Will you come there and  tell me what--which you decide?”    “With pleasure,” he answered, “if I can get away from a stupid dinner in  time.”    She let him go reluctantly. Afterwards she passed into her own room,  and stood looking at herself in the pier glass. Artists and the society  papers called her the most beautiful woman in England; fashion had  placed her upon such a pinnacle that men counted it a distinction to be  seen speaking to her. She dealt out her smiles and favors like Royalty  itself; she had never once known a rebuff. This afternoon she felt that  she had received one. Had she been too cold or too forward? Perhaps she  had underestimated the man himself. She rang for her maid.    “Celeste,” she said, “I shall wear my new Paquin gown tonight at the  opera, and my pearls.”    “Very good, your ladyship.”    “And I am going to lie down for an hour or two now. Don’t let me be  disturbed. I want to look my best tonight. You understand?”    “Perfectly, your ladyship.”    The Marchioness rested, but she did not sleep. She was thinking of  Wingrave!    It was not Lady Ruth, but her husband, who was waiting to see Wingrave  on his return. Aynesworth was talking to him, but at once withdrew.  Wingrave nodded with slightly upraised eyebrows. He never shook hands  with Barrington.    “You wanted to see me?” he inquired, carelessly turning over a little  pile of letters.    Barrington was ill at ease. He hated himself and he hated his errand.    “Yes, for a moment or two--if you’re not busy,” he said. “May I smoke?  I’m nervous this morning.”    “Help yourself,” Wingrave said shortly. “Cigarettes and cigars on the  sideboard. Touch the bell if you’ll take anything to drink.”    “Thanks--Aynesworth gave me a brandy and soda. Capital fellow,  Aynesworth!”    “Have another,” Wingrave said shortly.    He crossed the room to the sideboard. Wingrave glanced up from his  letters, and smiled coldly as he saw the shaking fingers.    “I don’t often indulge like this,” Barrington said, turning away from  the sideboard with a tumbler already empty in his hands. “The fact is,  I’ve had rather a rude knock, and Ruth thought I’d better come and see  you.”    Wingrave remained a study of impassivity. His guest’s whole demeanor,  his uneasy words and nervous glances were an unspoken appeal to be  helped out in what he had come to say. And Wingrave knew very well  what it was. Nevertheless, he remained silent--politely questioning.  Barrington sat down a little heavily. He was not so carefully dressed  as usual; he looked older, his appearance lacked altogether that air of  buoyant prosperity which was wont to inspire his friends and creditors  with confidence.    “I’ve been a fool, Wingrave,” he said. “You showed me how to make a  little money a few weeks ago, and it seemed so easy that I couldn’t  resist having a try by myself, only on rather a larger scale. I  lost! Then I went in again to pull myself round, and I lost again. I  lost--more than I can easily raise before settlement.”    “I am sorry,” Wingrave said politely. “It is very unwise to meddle in  things you know so little about.”    For a moment the worm turned. Barrington rose to his feet, and with  a deep flush upon his cheeks moved towards the door. But his spark of  genuine feeling died out almost as soon as it had been kindled. Outside  that door was ruin; within, as he very well knew, lay his only chance of  salvation. He set down his hat, and turned round.    “Wingrave,” he said, “will you lend me some money?”    Wingrave looked at him with upraised eyebrows.    “I,” he remarked, “lend you money? Why should I?”    “Heaven knows,” Barrington answered. “It is you who have chosen to  seek us out. You have forced upon us something which has at least the  semblance of friendship. There is no one else whom I could ask. It isn’t  only this damned Stock Exchange transaction. Everything has gone wrong  with me for years. If I could have kept going till next July, I should  have been all right. I have made a little success in the House, and I  am promised a place in the next government. I know it seems queer that  I should be asking you, but it is that--or ruin. Now you know how things  are with me.”    “You are making,” Wingrave said quietly, “a mistake. I have not  pretended or given the slightest evidence of any friendship for  yourself.”    Barrington looked at him with slowly mounting color.    “You mean--”    “Precisely,” Wingrave interrupted. “I do not know what I might or might  not do for Lady Ruth. I have not considered the subject. It has not, in  fact, been presented to me.”    “It is the same thing,” Barrington declared hoarsely.    “Pardon me--it is not,” Wingrave answered.    “What I ask you to do,” Barrington said, “I ask on behalf of my wife.”    “As an ambassador,” Wingrave said coldly, “you are not acceptable to  me. It is a matter which I could only discuss with Lady Ruth herself. If  Lady Ruth has anything to say to me, I will hear it.”    Barrington stood quite still for several moments. The veins on his  forehead stood out like tightly drawn cords, his breath came with  difficulty. The light in his eyes, as he looked at Wingrave, was almost  murderous.    “If Lady Ruth desires to see me,” Wingrave remarked slowly, “I shall be  here at nine o’clock this evening. Tomorrow my movements are uncertain.  You will excuse me if I hurry you away now. I have an engagement which  is already overdue.”    Barrington took up his hat and left the room without a word. Wingrave  remained in his chair. His eyes followed the departing figure of his  visitor. When he was absolutely sure that he was alone, he covered his  face with one hand. His engagement seemed to have been with his thoughts  for he did not stir for nearly an hour later. Then he rang the bell for  Aynesworth.          IN THE TOILS    Wingrave did not speak for several moments after Aynesworth had entered  the room. He had an engagement book before him and seemed to be deep in  its contents. When at last he looked up, his forehead was furrowed with  thought, and he had the weary air of a man who has been indulging in  unprofitable memories.    “Aynesworth,” he said, “be so good as to ring up Walters and excuse me  from dining with him tonight.”    Aynesworth nodded.    “Any particular form of excuse?” he asked.    “No! Say that I have an unavoidable engagement. I will see him tomorrow  morning.”    “Anything else?” Aynesworth asked, preparing to leave the room.    “No! You might see that I have no visitors this evening. Lady Ruth is  coming here at nine o’clock.”    “Lady Ruth is coming here,” Aynesworth repeated in a colorless tone.  “Alone?”    “Yes.”    Aynesworth shrugged his shoulders, but made no remark. He turned towards  the door, but Wingrave called him back.    “Your expression, Aynesworth,” he said, “interests me. Am I or the lady  in question responsible for it?”    “I am sorry for Lady Ruth,” Aynesworth said. “I think that I am sorry,  too, for her husband.”    “Why? She is coming of her own free will.”    “There are different methods of compulsion,” Aynesworth answered.    Wingrave regarded him thoughtfully.    “That,” he said, “is true. But I still do not understand why you are  sorry for her.”    “Because,” Aynesworth said, “I know the history of a certain event, and  I know you. It is, I suppose, for this end that you made use of them.”    Wingrave nodded.    “Quite right,” he declared. “I think that the time is not far off when  that dear lady and I can cry quits. This time, too, I see nothing to  impair my satisfaction at the probable finale. In various other cases,  as you might remember, I have not been entirely successful.”    “It depends,” Aynesworth remarked drily, “upon what you term success.”    Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.    “I think,” he said coldly, “that you are aware of what my feelings and  desired course of action have been with regard to those of my fellow  creatures with whom I have happened to come into contact. It seems to me  that I have been a trifle unfortunate in several instances.”    “As for instance?” Aynesworth asked.    “Well, to take a few cases only,” Wingrave continued, “there was the  child down at Tredowen whom you were so anxious for me to befriend. Of  course, I declined to do anything of the sort, and she ought, by rights,  to have gone to some charitable institution, founded and supported by  fools, and eventually become, perhaps, a domestic servant. Instead  of which, some relation of her father turns up and provides for her  lavishly. You must admit that that was unfortunate.”    “It depends upon the point of view,” Aynesworth remarked drily.  “Personally, I considered it a most fortunate occurrence.”    “Naturally,” Wingrave agreed. “But then you are a sentimentalist. You  like to see people happy, and you would even help to make them so if you  could without any personal inconvenience. I am at the other pole. If I  could collect humanity into one sentient force, I would set my heel upon  it without hesitation. I try to do what I can with the atoms, but I have  not the best of fortune. There was Mrs. Travers, now! There I should  have been successful beyond a doubt if some busybody hadn’t sent that  cable to her husband. I wonder if you were idiot enough to do that,  Aynesworth?”    “If I had thought of the Marconigram,” Aynesworth said, “I am sure I  should have done it. But as a matter of fact, I did not.”    “Just as well, so far as our relations are concerned,” Wingrave said  coldly. “I did manage to make poor men of a few brokers in New York,  but my best coup went wrong. That boy would have blown his brains out,  I believe, if some meddling idiot hadn’t found him all that money at the  last moment. I have had a few smaller successes, of course, and there  is this affair of Lady Ruth and her estimable husband. You know that he  came to borrow money of me, I suppose?”    “I guessed it,” Aynesworth answered. “You should be modern in your  revenge and lend it to him.”    Wingrave smiled coldly.    “I fancy,” he said, “that Lumley Barrington will find my revenge modern  enough. I may lend the money they need--but it will be to Lady Ruth! I  told her husband so a few minutes ago. I told him to send his wife to  me. He has gone to tell her now!”    “I wonder,” Aynesworth remarked, “that he did not thrash you--or try  to.”    Again Wingrave’s lips parted.    “Moral deterioration has set in already,” he remarked. “When he pays  his bills with my money, he will lose the little he has left of his  self-respect.”    Aynesworth turned abruptly away. He was strongly tempted to say things  which would have ended his connection with Wingrave, and as yet he was  not ready to leave. For the sake of a digression, he took up a check  book from the table.    “There are three checks,” he remarked, “which I cannot trace. One  for ten thousand pounds, another for five, and a third for a thousand  pounds. What account shall I put them to?”    “Private drawing account,” Wingrave answered. “They represent a small  speculation. By the bye, you’d better go and ring up Walters.”    “Do you wish the particulars entered in your sundry investment book?”   Aynesworth asked.    Wingrave smiled grimly.    “I think not,” he answered. “You can put them to drawing account. If  you want me again this evening, I shall dine at the Cafe Royal at eight  o’clock, and shall return here at five minutes to nine.”         . . . . . . . . . . .    Lady Ruth was punctual. At a few minutes past nine, Morrison announced  that a lady had called to see Mr. Wingrave by appointment.    “You can show her in,” Wingrave said. “See that we are not disturbed.”    Lady Ruth was scarcely herself. She was dressed in a high-necked muslin  gown, and she wore a hat and veil, which somewhat obscured her features.  The latter she raised, however, as she accepted the chair which Wingrave  had placed for her. He saw then that she was pale, and her manner  betrayed an altogether unfamiliar nervousness. She avoided his eyes.    “Did you expect me?” she asked.    “Yes!” he answered, “I thought that you would come.”    Her foot, long and slender, beat impatiently upon the ground. She looked  up at him once, but immediately withdrew her eyes.    “Why did you bring me here?” she asked in a low tone.    “My dear Lady Ruth!” he protested.    “If you want to play at being friends,” she said, “for heaven’s sake  call me Ruth. You found it easy enough once.”    “You are very kind,” he answered. “Ruth, by all means.”    “Now will you answer my question?” she said. “Do you mean--to help us?”    “Us--no!” he answered; “you--perhaps yes!” he added.    Then she looked at him, and found herself puzzled by the perfect  impassivity of his features. Surely he would drop the mask now. He had  insisted upon her coming!    “Perhaps?” she repeated. “What then--are the conditions?”    He bent over towards her. Curiously enough, there was, mingled with  many other sensations, a certain sense of triumph in the thought, it was  almost a hope, that at last he was going to betray himself, that he was  going to admit tacitly, or by imputation, that her power over him was  not wholly dead. It was a terrible situation--in her heart she felt so,  but it had its compensations. Wingrave had been her constant attendant  for months. He had seen her surrounded by men, all anxious to secure a  smile from her; he had seen her play the great lady in her own house,  and she played it very well. She knew that she was a past mistress in  the arts which fascinate his sex, she understood the quiet speeches, the  moods, every trick of the gamester in emotions, from the fluttering  of eyelids to the unchaining of the passions. And he had loved her.  Underneath it all, he must love her now. She was determined that he  should tell her so. It was genuine excitement which throbbed in her  pulses, a genuine color which burned in her cheeks.    “The conditions?” he repeated. “You believe, then, that I mean to make  conditions?”    She raised her eyes to his, eloquent eyes she knew, and looked at him.  The mask was still there--but he had moved a little nearer to her.    “I do not know,” she said softly. “You must tell me.”    There was a moment’s silence. She had scarcely given herself credit for  such capacity for emotion. He was on his feet. Surely the mask must go  now! And then--she felt that it must be a nightmare. It was incredible!  He had struck a match and was calmly lighting a cigarette.    “One,” he said coolly, “is that Mademoiselle Violet employs no more  amateur assassins to make clumsy attempts upon my life.”    She sat in her place rigid--half frozen with a cold, numbing fear. He  had sent for her, then, only to mock her. She had failed! They were not  even to have the money! Speech was quite impossible. Then he continued.    “I will take your assent for granted,” he said. “Do you know how much  you require to free yourself?”    “About eight thousand pounds!” she answered mechanically.    He sat down and wrote a check, which he laid before her.    “You will have to endorse that,” he remarked in a matter-of-fact tone.  “Your name at the back will do instead of a receipt.”    She sprang to her feet.    “Keep your money,” she cried. “I will not touch it. Please open the door  for me! I am going.”    “By all means--if you wish it,” he answered undisturbed. “At the same  time, I am curious to know why you came here at all if you did not  intend to accept it.”    She faced him, hot and angry.    “I did intend to accept it,” she declared. “It is that or ruin. But you  are too cruel! You make it--impossible.”    “You surprise me,” he answered. “I suppose you know best.”    “For heaven’s sake tell me,” she cried passionately, “what has come to  you, what manner of a man are you? You loved me once! Now, even, after  all these years, you cannot deny it. You have gone out of your way to  be with me, to be my companion wherever we are. People are beginning to  smile when they see us together. I don’t mind. I--for God’s sake tell  me, Wingrave! Why do you do it? Why do you lend me this money? What can  I do for you? What do you want me to be? Are you as cold as a stone?  Have you no heart--no heart even for friendship!”    “I would not seek,” he answered, “to buy--your friendship with a check!”    “But it is yours already,” she cried, holding out her hands. “Give me  a little kindness, Wingrave! You make me feel and seem a perfect idiot.  Why, I’d rather you asked me anything that treated me like this.”    “I was under the impression,” Wingrave remarked, “that I was behaving  rather well. I wonder what would really satisfy you!”    “To have you behave as you are doing, and want to behave differently,”   she cried. “You are magnificent--but it is because you are indifferent.  Will you kiss me, Wingrave?”    “With pleasure!” he answered.    She drew away from him quickly.    “Is it--another woman?” she asked. “The Marchioness?”    Her eagerness was almost painful. He did not answer her at once. She  caught hold of his wrist and drew him towards her. Her eyes searched his  face.    “The Marchioness,” he said, “is a very beautiful woman. She does not,  however, affect the situation as between you and me.”    “If she dared!” Lady Ruth murmured. “Wingrave, won’t you try and be  friends with me?”    “I will try--certainly,” he answered. “You would be surprised, however,  if you could realize the effect of a long period of enforced seclusion  upon a man of my--”    “Don’t!” she shrieked; “stop!”    “My temperament, I was about to say,” he concluded. “There was a time  when I am afraid I might have been tempted, under such circumstances as  these, to forget that you were no longer free, to forget everything that  except we were alone, and that you--are as beautiful as ever you were!”    “Yes!” she murmured, moving imperceptibly a little nearer towards him.    He picked up the check and gave it to her.    “I am no actor,” he said, looking at her steadily. “At present, I make  no conditions. But--”    She leaned towards him. He took her face between his hands and kissed  her on the lips.    “I may make them later,” he said. “I reserve my right.”    She looked at him for a moment, and dropped her veil.    “Please take me down to my carriage,” she asked.          THE INDISCRETION OF THE MARCHIONESS    “I am perfectly certain,” Juliet declared, “that we ought not to be  here.”    “That,” Aynesworth remarked, fanning himself lightly with his pocket  handkerchief, “may account for the extraordinary sense of pleasure which  I am now experiencing. At the same time, I can’t see why not.”    “I only met you this afternoon--a few hours ago. And here we are,  absolutely wedged together on these seats--and my chaperon is dozing  half the time.”    “Pardon me,” Aynesworth objected, “I knew you when you were a child.”    “For one day!”    “Nevertheless,” Aynesworth persisted, “the fact remains. If you date our  acquaintance from this afternoon, I do not. I have never forgotten the  little girl in short frocks and long black hair, who showed me where the  seagulls built, and told me Cornish fairy stories.”    “It was a very long time ago,” she remarked.    “Four years,” he answered; “for you, perhaps, a long time, because  you have changed from a child--into a woman. But for a man approaching  middle age--as I am--nothing!”    “That is all very well,” she answered, “but I am not sure that we ought  to be in the gallery at Covent Garden together, with a chaperon who will  sleep!”    “She will wake up,” he declared, “with the music.”    “And I,” she murmured, “will dream. Isn’t it lovely?”    He smiled.    “I wonder how it really seems to you,” he remarked. “We are breathing an  atmosphere hot with gas, and fragrant with orange peel. We are squashed  in amongst a crowd of people of a class whom I fancy that neither you  nor I know much about. And I saw you last in a wilderness! We saw only  the yellow sands, and the rocks, and the Atlantic. We heard only  the thunder of the sea and the screaming of seagulls. This is very  different.”    “Wonderfully, wonderfully different,” she answered. “I miss it all! Of  course I do, and yet one is so much nearer to life here, the real life  of men and women. Oh, one cannot compare it. Why should one try? Ah,  listen!”    The curtain went up. The music of the orchestra subsided, and the music  of the human voice floated through the Opera House--the human voice,  vibrant with joy and passion and the knowledge which lies behind the  veil. Juliet found no time to talk then, no time to think even of her  companion. Her young cheeks were flushed, her eyes were bright with  excitement. She leaned a little forward in her place, she passed with  all the effortless facility of her ingenuous youth, into the dim world  of golden fancies which the story of the opera was slowly unfolding.  Beside her, Mrs. Tresfarwin dozed and blinked and dozed again--and on  her left Aynesworth himself, a little affected by the music, still found  time to glance continually at his companion, so radiant with life and  so fervently intent upon realizing to the full this, the first of its  unknown joys. So with crashing of chords and thunder of melody the act  went on. And when it was over, Juliet thought no more of the Cornish  sea and the lullaby of the waves. A new music was stirring in her young  blood.    They were in the front row of the gallery, and presently she leaned over  to gaze down at the panorama below, the women in the boxes and stalls,  whose bare shoulders and skillfully coiffured hair flashed with jewels.  Suddenly her hand fell upon Aynesworth’s arm.    “Look!” she cried in some excitement, “do you see who that is in the box  there--the one almost next to the stage?”    Aynesworth, too, uttered a little exclamation. The lights from beneath  were falling full upon the still, cold face of the man who had just  taken a vacant chair in one of the boxes.    “Wingrave!” he exclaimed, and glanced at once at his watch.    “Sir Wingrave Seton,” she murmured. “Isn’t it strange that I should see  him here tonight?”    “He comes often,” Aynesworth answered. “Music is one of his few  weaknesses.”    There was a movement in the box, and a woman’s head and shoulders  appeared from behind the curtain. Juliet gave a little gasp.    “Mr. Aynesworth,” she exclaimed, “did you ever see such a beautiful  woman? Do tell me who she is!”    “A very great lady in London society,” Aynesworth answered. “That is  Emily, Marchioness of Westchester.”    Juliet’s eyes never moved from her until the beautiful neck and  shoulders were turned away. She leaned over towards her companion, and  she did not again, for some few minutes, face the house.    “She is the loveliest woman I ever saw in my life,” Juliet said with  a little sigh. “Is she a great friend of Sir Wingrave Seton, Mr.  Aynesworth?”    “He has no friends,” Aynesworth answered. “I believe that they are very  well acquainted.”    “Poor Sir Wingrave!” Juliet murmured softly.    Aynesworth looked at her in some surprise.    “It is odd that you should have recognized him from up here,” he  remarked thoughtfully. “He has changed so much during the last few  years.”    Juliet smiled, but she did not explain. She felt that she was obeying  Wingrave’s wishes.    “I should have recognized him anywhere,” she answered simply. “I wonder  what they are talking about. She seems so interested, and he looks so  bored.”    Aynesworth looked at his watch. It was barely ten o’clock.    “I am very glad to see him here this evening,” he remarked.    “I should like so much,” she said, still gazing at them earnestly, “to  know that they are talking about.”         . . . . . . . . . . .    “So you will not tell me,” the Marchioness murmured, ceasing for a  moment the graceful movements of her fan, and looking at him steadily.  “You refuse me this--almost the first thing I have ever asked you?”    “It is scarcely,” Wingrave objected, “a reasonable question.”    “Between you and me,” she murmured, “such punctiliousness is scarcely  necessary--is it?”    He withstood the attack of those wonderful eyes lifted swiftly to his,  and answered her gravely.    “You are Lady Ruth’s friend,” he remarked. “Probably, therefore, she  will tell you all about it.”    The Marchioness laughed softly, yet with something less than mirth.    “Friends,” she exclaimed, “Lady Ruth and I? There was never a woman in  this world who was less my friend--especially now!”    He asked for no explanation of her last words, but in a moment or two  she vouchsafed it. She leaned a little forward, her eyes flashed softly  through the semi-darkness.    “Lady Ruth is afraid,” she said quietly, “that I might take you away  from her.”    “My dear lady,” he protested, “the slight friendship between Lady Ruth  and myself is not of the nature to engender such a fear.”    She shrugged her beautiful shoulders. Her hands were toying with the  rope of pearls which hung from her neck. She bent over them, as though  examining the color of the stones.    “How long have you known Ruth?” she asked quietly.    He looked at her steadfastly. He could not be sure whether it was his  fancy, or whether indeed there was some hidden meaning in her question.    “Since I came to live in England,” he answered.    “Ah!”    There was a moment’s silence. Then with a little wave of her hands and a  brilliant smile, she figuratively dismissed the subject.    “We waste time,” she remarked lightly, “and we may have callers at  any moment. I will ask you no more questions save those which the  conventions may permit you to answer truthfully. We can’t depart from  our code, can we, even for the sake of an inquisitive woman?”    “I can assure you--” he began.    “But I will have no assurances,” she interrupted smilingly. “I am going  to talk of other things. I am going to ask you a ridiculous question.  Are you fond of music?--seriously!”    “I believe so,” he answered. “Why?”    “Because,” she answered, “I sometimes wonder what there is in the world  that interests you! Certainly, none of the ordinary things seem to.  Tonight, almost for the first time, I saw you look a little drawn out  of yourself. I was wondering whether it was the music or the people. I  suppose, until one gets used to it,” she added, looking a little wearily  around the house, “an audience like this is worth looking at.”    “It certainly is not the people,” he said. “Do you make as close a study  of all your acquaintances?”    “Naturally not,” she answered, “and I do not class you amongst my  acquaintances at all. You interest me, my friend--very much indeed!”    “I am flattered,” he murmured.    “You are not--I wish that you were,” she answered simply. “I can  understand why you have succeeded where so many others have failed.  You are strong. You have nerves of steel--and very little heart. But  now--what are you going to do with your life, now that wealth must even  have lost its meaning to you? I should like to know that. Will you tell  me?”    “What is there to do?” he asked. “Eat and drink, and juggle a little  with the ball of fate.”    “You are not ambitious?”    “Not in the least.”    “Pleasure, for itself, does not attract you. No! I know that it does  not. What are you going to do, then?”    “I have no idea,” he answered. “Won’t you direct me?”    “Yes, I will,” she answered, “if you will pay my price.”    He looked at her more intently. He himself had been attaching no  particular importance to this conversation, but he was suddenly  conscious that it was not so with the woman at his side. Her eyes were  shining at him, soft and full and sweet; her beautiful bosom was rising  and falling quickly; there had come to her something which even he was  forced to recognize, that curious and voluptuous abandonment which a  woman rarely permits herself, and can never assume. He was a little  bewildered. His speech lost for a moment its cold precision.    “Your price?” he repeated. “I--I am stupid. I’m afraid I don’t  understand.”    “Marry me,” she whispered in his ear, “and I will take you a little  further into life than you could ever go alone You don’t care for me, of  course--but you shall. You don’t understand this world, Wingrave, or how  to make the best of it. I do! Let me be your guide!”    Wingrave looked at her in grave astonishment.    “You are not by any chance--in earnest?” he asked.    “You know very well that I am,” she answered swiftly. “And yet you  hesitate! What is it that you are afraid of? Don’t you like to give up  your liberty? We need not marry unless you choose. That is only a matter  of form nowadays at any rate. I have a hundred chaperons to choose from.  Society expects strange things from me. It is your companionship I want.  Your money is fascinating, of course. I should like to see you spend it,  to spend it with both hands. Don’t be afraid that we should be talked  about. I am not Lady Ruth! I am Emily, Marchioness of Westchester, and I  live and choose my friends as I please; will you be chief amongst them?  Hush!”    For Wingrave it was providential. The loud chorus which had heralded  the upraising of the curtain died away. Melba’s first few notes were  floating through the house. Silence was a necessity. The low passion of  the music rippled from the stage, through the senses and into the hearts  of many of the listeners. But Wingrave listened silent and unmoved. He  was even unconscious that the woman by his side was watching him half  anxiously every now and then.    The curtain descended amidst a thunder of applause. Wingrave turned  slowly towards his companion. And then there came a respite--a knock at  the door.    The Marchioness frowned, but Wingrave was already holding it open.  Lady Ruth, followed by an immaculate young guardsman, a relative of her  husband, was standing there.    “Mr. Wingrave!” she exclaimed softly, with upraised eyebrows, “why have  you contrived to render yourself invisible? We thought you were alone,  Emily,” she continued, “and took pity on you. And all the time you had a  prize.”    The Marchioness looked at Lady Ruth, and Lady Ruth looked at the  Marchioness. The young guardsman was a little sorry that he had come,  but Lady Ruth never turned a hair.    “You must really have your eyes seen to, dear,” the Marchioness remarked  in a tone of tender concern. “When you can’t see such an old friend as  Mr. Wingrave from a few yards away, they must be very bad indeed.  How are you, Captain Kendrick? Come and tell me about the polo this  afternoon. Sorry I can’t offer you all chairs. This is an absurd box--it  was only meant for two!”    “Come into ours,” Lady Ruth said; “we have chairs for six, I think.”    The Marchioness shook her head.    “I wish I had a millionaire in the family,” she murmured. “All the same,  I hate large parties. I am old-fashioned enough to think that two is a  delightful number.”    Lady Ruth laid her hand upon Wingrave’s arm.    “A decided hint, Mr. Wingrave,” she declared. “Come and let me introduce  you to my sister. Our box is only a few yards off.”          “I AM MISANTHROPOS, AND HATE MANKIND”    Wingrave had just come in from an early gallop. His pale cheeks were  slightly flushed, and his eyes were bright. He had been riding hard to  escape from disconcerting thoughts. He looked in at the study, and found  Aynesworth with a mass of correspondence before him.    “Anything important?” he asked.    “Not yet,” Aynesworth answered. “The letters marked private I have sent  up to your room. By the bye, there was something I wanted to tell you.”    Wingrave closed the door.    “Well?” he said.    “I was up in the gallery of the Opera House last night,” Aynesworth  said, “with a--person who saw you only once, soon after I first came  to you--before America. You were some distance away, and yet--my friend  recognized you.”    Wingrave shrugged his shoulders.    “That, of course, is possible,” he answered. “It really does not matter  so very much unless they knew me--as Wingrave Seton!”    “My friend,” Aynesworth said, “recognized you as Sir Wingrave Seton.”    Wingrave frowned thoughtfully for a moment.    “Who was it?” he asked.    “A most unlikely person,” Aynesworth remarked smiling. “Do you remember,  when we went down to Tredowen just before we left for America, a little,  long-legged, black-frocked child, whom we met in the gardens--the  organist’s daughter, you know?”    “What of her?” Wingrave asked.    “It was she who was with me,” Aynesworth remarked. “It was she who saw  you in the box with the Marchioness of Westchester.”    Aynesworth was puzzled by the intentness with which Wingrave was  regarding him. Impenetrable though the man was, Aynesworth, who had not  yet lost his early trick of studying him closely, knew that, for some  reason or other, his intelligence had proved disturbing.    “Have you then--kept up your acquaintance with this child?” he demanded.    Aynesworth shook his head.    “She is not a child any longer, but a very beautiful young woman,” he  said. “I met her again quite by accident. She is up in London, studying  art at the studio of an old friend of mine who has a class of girls. I  called to see him the other afternoon, and recognized her.”    “Your acquaintance,” Wingrave remarked, “has progressed rapidly if she  accepts your escort--to the gallery of the Opera!”    “It was scarcely like that,” Aynesworth explained. “I met her and Mrs.  Tresfarwin on the way there, and asked to be allowed to accompany them.  Mrs. Tresfarwin was once your housekeeper, I think, at Tredowen.”    “And did you solve the mystery of this relation of her father who turned  up so opportunely?” Wingrave asked.    Aynesworth shook his head.    “She told me nothing about him,” he answered.    Wingrave passed on to his own room. His breakfast was on the table  awaiting him, and a little pile of letters and newspapers stood by his  plate. His servant, his head groom, and his chauffeur were there to  receive their orders for the morning. About him were all the evidences  of his well-ordered life. He sent both the men away and locked the  door. It was half an hour before he touched either his breakfast or his  letters....    He lunched at Westchester House in obedience to a somewhat imperative  summons. There were other guests there, whom, however, he outstayed. As  soon as they were alone, his hostess touched him on the arm and led him  to her own room.    “At last!” she exclaimed, with an air of real relief. “There, sit down  opposite to me, please--I want to watch your face.”    She was a little paler than usual, and he noticed that she had avoided  talking much to him at luncheon time. And yet he thought that he had  never seen her more beautiful. Something in her face had altered. He  could not tell what it was for he was not a man of much experience as  regarded her sex. Yet, in a vague sort of way, he understood the  change. A certain part of the almost insolent quietness, the complete  self-assurance of her manner, had gone. She was a little more like an  ordinary woman!    “Lady Ruth proved herself an excellent tactician last night,” she  remarked. “She has given me an exceedingly uncomfortable few hours. For  you, well for you it was a respite, wasn’t it?”    “I don’t know that I should call it exactly that,” he answered  thoughtfully.    She looked at him steadfastly, almost wistfully.    “Well,” she said, “I am not going to make excuses for myself. But the  things which one says naturally enough when the emotions provoke them  sound crude enough in cold blood and colder daylight. We women are  creatures of mood, you know. I was feeling a little lonely and a little  tired last night, and the music stole away my common sense.”    “I understand,” he murmured. “All that you said shall be forgotten.”    “Then you do not understand,” she answered, smiling at him. “What I said  I do not wish to be forgotten. Only--just at that moment, it sounded  natural enough--and today--I think that I am a little ashamed.”    He rose from his seat. Her eyes leaped up to his expectantly, and the  color streamed into her cheeks. But he only stood by her side. He did  nothing to meet the half-proffered embrace.    “Dear Lady Emily,” he said, “all the kind things that you said were  spoken to a stranger. You did not know me. I did not mean anyone to know  me. It is you who have commanded the truth. You must have it. I am not  the person I seem to be. I am not the person to whom words such as yours  should have been spoken. Even my name is an assumed one. I should prefer  to leave it at that--if you are content.”    “I am not content,” she answered quietly; “I must hear more.”    He bowed.    “I am a man,” he said, “who spent ten years in prison, the ten best  years of my life. A woman sent me there--a woman swore my liberty away  to save her reputation. I was never of a forgiving disposition, I was  never an amiably disposed person. I want you to understand this. Any of  the ordinary good qualities with which the average man may be endowed,  and which I may have possessed, are as dead in me as hell fire could  burn them. You have spoken of me as of a man who failed to find a  sufficient object in life. You were wrong. I have an object, and I do  my best to live up to it. I hate the whole world of men and women who  laughed their way through life whilst I suffered--tortures. I hate the  woman who sent me there. I have no heart, nor any sense of pity. Now  perhaps you can understand my life and the manner of it.”    Her hands were clasped to the side of her head. Something of horror had  stolen into the steadfast gaze with which she was still regarding him.  Yet there were other things there which puzzled him.    “This--is terrible!” she murmured. “Then you are not--Mr. Wingrave at  all?”    He hesitated. After all, it was scarcely worth while concealing anything  now.    “I am Sir Wingrave Seton,” he said. “You may remember my little affair!”    She caught hold of his hands.    “You poor, poor dear!” she cried. “How you must have suffered!”    Wingrave had a terrible moment. What he felt he would never have  admitted, even to himself. Her eyes were shining with sympathy, and it  was so unexpected. He had expected something in the nature of a cold  withdrawal; her silence was the only thing he had counted upon. It was a  fierce, but short battle. His sudden grasp of her hands was relaxed. He  stood away from her.    “You are very kind,” he said. “As you can doubtless imagine, it is a  little too late for sympathy. The years have gone, and the better part  of me, if ever there was a better part, with them.”    “I am not so sure of that!” she whispered.    He looked at her coldly.    “Why not?”    “If you were absolutely heartless,” she said, “if you were perfectly  consistent, why did you not make me suffer? You had a great chance! A  little feigned affection, and then a few truths. You could have dragged  me down a little way into the pit of broken hearts! Why didn’t you?”    He frowned.    “One is forced to neglect a few opportunities!”    She smiled at him--delightfully.    “You foolish man!” she murmured. “Some day or other, you will turn out  to be a terrible impostor. Do you know, I think I am going to ask you  again--what I asked you last night?”    “I scarcely think that you will be so ill-advised,” he declared coldly.  “Whether you believe it or not, I can assure you that I am incapable of  affection.”    She sighed.    “I am not so sure about that,” she said with protesting eyebrows, “but  you are terribly hard-hearted?”    He was entirely dissatisfied with the impression he had produced. He  considered the attitude of the Marchioness unjustifiably frivolous. He  had an uneasy conviction that she was not in the least inclined to take  him seriously.    “I don’t think,” he said, glancing at the clock, “that I need detain you  any longer.”    “You are really going away, then?” she asked him softly.    “Yes.”    “To call on Lady Ruth, perhaps?”    “As it happens, no,” he answered.    Suddenly her face changed--she had remembered something.    “It was Lady Ruth!” she exclaimed.    “Exactly!” he interrupted.    “What a triumph of inconsistency!” she declared scornfully. “You are  lending them money!”    “I am lending money to Lady Ruth,” he answered slowly.    Their eyes met. She understood, at any rate, what he intended to convey.  Certainly his expression was hard and merciless enough now!    “Poor Ruth,” she murmured.    “Some day,” he answered, “you will probably say that in earnest.”          JULIET GAINS EXPERIENCE    “Of course,” Juliet said, “after Tredowen it seems very small, almost  poky, but it isn’t, really, and Tredowen was not for me all my days. It  was quite time I got used to something else.”    Wingrave looked around him with expressionless face. It was a tiny  room, high up on the fifth floor of a block of flats, prettily but  inexpensively furnished. Juliet herself, tall and slim, with all the  fire of youth and perfect health on her young face, was obviously  contented.    “And your work?” he asked.    She made a little grimace.    “I have a good deal to unlearn,” she said, “but Mr. Pleydell is very  kind and encouraging.”    “You will go down to Cornwall for the hot weather, I hope?” he said.  “London is unbearable in August.”    “The class are going for a sketching tour to Normandy,” she said,  “and Mr. Pleydell thought that I might like to join them. It is very  inexpensive, and I should be able to go on with my work all the time.”    He nodded thoughtfully.    “I hear,” he said, “that you have met Mr. Aynesworth again.”    “Wasn’t it delightful?” she exclaimed. “He is quite an old friend of Mr.  Pleydell. I was so glad to see him.”    “I suppose,” he remarked, “you are a little lonely sometimes?”    “Sometimes,” she admitted. “But I sha’n’t be when I get to know the  girls in the class a little better.”    “I have some friends,” he said thoughtfully, “women, of course, who  would come and see you with pleasure. And yet,” he added, “I am not sure  that you would not be better off without knowing them.”    “They are fashionable ladies, perhaps?” she said simply.    He nodded.    “They belong to the Juggernaut here which is called society. They would  probably try to draw you a little way into its meshes. I think, yes, I  am sure,” he added, looking at her, “that you are better off outside.”    “And I am quite sure of it,” she answered laughing. “I haven’t the  clothes or the time or the inclination for that sort of thing. Besides,  I am going to be much too happy ever to be lonely.”    “I myself,” he said, “am not an impressionable person. But they tell me  that most people, especially of your age, find London a terribly lonely  place.”    “I can understand that,” she answered, “unless they really had something  definite to do. I have felt a little of that myself. I think London  frightens me a little. It is so different from the country, and there is  a great deal that is difficult to understand.”    “For instance?”    “The great number of poor people who find it so hard to live,” she  answered. “Some of the small houses round here are awful, and  Mr. Malcolm--he is the vicar of the church here, and he called  yesterday--tells me that they are nothing like so bad as in some  other parts of London. And then you take a bus, it is such a short  distance--and the shops are full of wonderful things at such fabulous  prices, and the carriages and houses are so lovely, and people seem to  be showering money right and left everywhere.”    “It is the same in all large cities,” he answered, “more or less.  There must always be rich and poor, when a great community are herded  together. As a rule, the extreme poor are a worthless lot.”    “There must be some of them, though,” she answered, “who deserve to  have a better time. Of course, I have never been outside Tredowen, where  everyone was contented and happy in their way, and it seems terrible to  me just at first. I can’t bear to think that everyone hasn’t at least a  chance of happiness.”    “You are too young,” he said, “to bother your head about these things  yet. Wait until you have gathered in a little philosophy with the years.  Then you will understand how helpless you are to alter by ever so little  the existing state of things, and it will trouble you less.”    “I,” she answered, “may, of course, be helpless, but what about those  people who have huge fortunes, and still do nothing?”    “Why should they?” he answered coldly. “This is a world for individual  effort. No man is strong enough to carry even a single one of his  fellows upon his shoulders. Charity is the most illogical and pernicious  of all weaknesses.”    “Now you are laughing at me,” she declared. “I mean men like that  Mr. Wingrave, the American who has come to England to spend all his  millions. I have just been reading about him,” she added, pointing to an  illustrated paper on the table. “They say that his income is too vast  to be put into figures which would sound reasonable; that he has estates  and shooting properties, and a yacht which he has never yet even  seen. And yet he will not give one penny away. He gives nothing to the  hospitals, nothing to the poor. He spends his money on himself, and  himself alone!”    Wingrave smiled grimly.    “I am not prepared to defend my namesake,” he said; “but every man has a  right to do what he likes with his own, hasn’t he? And as for hospitals,  Mr. Wingrave probably thinks, like a good many more, that they should be  state endowed. People could make use of them, then, without loss of self  respect.”    She shook her head a little doubtfully.    “I can’t argue about it yet,” she said, “because I haven’t thought  about it long enough. But I know if I had all the money this man has,  I couldn’t be happy to spend thousands and thousands upon myself while  there were people almost starving in the same city.”    “You are a sentimentalist, you see,” he remarked, “and you have not  studied the laws on which society is based. Tell me, how does Mrs.  Tresfarwin like London?”    Juliet laughed merrily.    “Isn’t it amusing?” she declared. “She loves it! She grumbles at the  milk, and we have the butter from Tredowen. Everything else she finds  perfection. She doesn’t even mind the five flights of stone steps.”    “Social problems,” Wingrave remarked, “do not trouble her.”    “Not in the least,” Juliet declared. “She spends all her pennies on  beggars and omnibus rides, and she is perfectly happy.”    Wingrave rose to go in a few minutes. Juliet walked with him to the  door.    “I am going to be really hospitable,” she declared. “I am going to walk  with you to the street.”    “All down those five flights?” he exclaimed.    “Every one of them!”    They commenced the descent.    “There is something about a flat,” she declared, “which makes one  horribly curious about one’s neighbors--especially if one has never had  any. All these closed doors may hide no end of interesting people, and  I have never seen a soul go in or out. How did you like all this  climbing?”    “I’m afraid I didn’t appreciate it,” he admitted.    “Perhaps you won’t come to see me again, then?” she asked. “I hope you  will.”    “I will come,” he said a little stiffly, “with pleasure!”    They were on the ground floor, and Juliet opened the door. Wingrave’s  motor was outside, and the man touched his hat. She gave a little  breathless cry.    “It isn’t yours?” she exclaimed.    “Certainly,” he answered. “Do you want to come and look at it?”    “Rather!” she exclaimed. “I have never seen one close to in my life.”    He hesitated.    “I’ll take you a little way, if you like,” he said.    Her cheeks were pink with excitement.    “If I like! And I’ve never been in one before! I’ll fly up for my hat. I  sha’n’t be a moment.”    She was already halfway up the first flight of stairs, with a whirl of  skirts and flying feet. Wingrave lit a cigarette and stood for a moment  thoughtfully upon the pavement. Then he shrugged his shoulders. His face  had grown a little harder.    “She must take her chances,” he muttered. “No one knows her. Nobody is  likely to find out who she is.”    She was down again in less time than seemed possible. Her cheeks were  flushed and her eyes bright with excitement. Wingrave took the wheel  himself, and she sat up by his side. They glided off almost noiselessly.    “We will go up to the Park,” he said. “It is just the time to see the  people.”    “Anywhere!” she exclaimed. “This is too lovely!”    They passed from Battersea northwards into Piccadilly, and down into the  Park. Juliet was too excited to talk; Wingrave had enough to do to drive  the car. They passed plenty of people who bowed, and many who glanced  with wondering admiration at the beautiful girl who sat by Wingrave’s  side. Lady Ruth, who drive by quickly in a barouche, almost rose from  her seat; the Marchioness, whose victoria they passed, had time to wave  her hand and flash a quick, searching glance at Juliet, who returned  it with her dark eyes filled with admiration. The Marchioness smiled to  herself a little sadly as the car shot away ahead.    “If one asked,” she murmured to herself, “he would try to persuade one  that it was another victim.”          NEMESIS AT WORK    Wingrave was present that evening at a reception given by the Prime  Minister to some distinguished foreign guests. He had scarcely exchanged  the usual courtesies with his host and hostess before Lady Ruth, leaning  over from a little group, whispered in his ear.    “Please take me away. I am bored. I want to talk to you.”    He paused at once. Lady Ruth nodded to her friends.    “Mr. Wingrave is going to take me to hear Melba sing,” she said. “See  you all again, I suppose, at Hereford House!”    They made slow progress through the crowded rooms. Once or twice  Wingrave fancied that his companion hung a little heavily upon his arm.  She showed no desire to talk. She even answered a remark of his in a  monosyllable. Only when they passed the Marchioness, on the arm of one  of the foreign guests in whose honor the reception was given, she seemed  to shiver a little, and her grasp upon his arm was tightened. Once, in  a block, she was forced to speak to some acquaintances, and during  those few seconds, Wingrave studied her curiously. She was absolutely  colorless, and her strange brilliant eyes seemed to have lost all their  fire. Her gown was black, and the decorations of her hair were black  except for a single diamond. There was something almost spectral about  her appearance. She walked stiffly--for the moment she had lost the  sinuous grace of movement which had been one of her many fascinations.  Her neck and shoulders alone remained, as ever, dazzlingly beautiful.    They reached a quiet corner at last. Lady Ruth sank with a little  gesture of relief into an easy chair. Wingrave stood before her.    “You are tired tonight,” he remarked.    “I am always tired,” she answered wearily. “I begin to think that I  always shall be.”    He said nothing. Lady Ruth closed her eyes for a moment as though from  sheer fatigue. Suddenly she opened them again and looked him full in the  face.    “Who was she?” she asked.    “I do not understand,” he replied.    “The child you were with--the ingenue, you know--with the pink cheeks  and the wonderful eyes! Is she from one of the theaters, or a genuine  article?”    “The young lady to whom you refer,” he answered, “is the daughter of  an old friend of mine. I am practically her guardian. She is in London  studying painting.”    “You are her guardian?” Lady Ruth repeated. “I am sorry for her.”    “You need not be,” he answered. “I trust that I shall be able to fulfill  my duties in a perfectly satisfactory manner.”    “Oh! I have no doubt of it,” she answered. “Yet I am sorry for her.”    “You are certainly,” he remarked, “not in an amiable mood.”    “I am in rather a desperate one if that is anything,” she said, looking  at him with something of the old light in her tired eyes.    “You made a little error, perhaps, in those calculations?” he suggested.  “It can be amended.”    “Don’t be a brute,” she answered fiercely.    He shrugged his shoulders.    “That sounds a little severe,” he remarked.    “Don’t take any notice of anything I say tonight,” she murmured softly.  “I am a little mad. I think that everything is going against me! I know  that you haven’t a grain of sympathy for me--that you would rather see  me suffer than not, and yet you see I give myself away entirely. Why  shouldn’t I? Part of it is through you in a way.”    “I rather fancied,” he remarked, “that up to now--”    “Yes! Of course!” she interrupted, “you saved me from ruin, staved it  off at any rate. And you held over the reckoning! I--I almost wish--”    She paused. Again her eyes were searching his.    “I am a little tired of it all, you see,” she continued. “I don’t  suppose Lumley and I can ever be the same again since I brought  him--that check. He avoids being alone with me--I do the same with him.  One would think--to watch the people, that the whole transaction was in  the Morning Post. They smile when they see us together, they grin when  they see you with anybody else. It’s getting hateful, Wingrave!”    “I am afraid,” he said quietly, “that you are in a nervous,  hypersensitive state. No one else can possibly know of the little  transaction between us, and, so far as I am concerned, there has been  nothing to interfere with your relations with your husband.”    “You are right,” she answered, “I am losing my nerve. I am only afraid  that I am losing something else. I haven’t an ounce of battle left in  me. I feel that I should like to close my eyes and wake up in a new  world, and start all over again.”    “It is nothing but a mood,” he assured her. “Those new worlds don’t  exist any longer. They generally consist of foreign watering places  where the sheep and the goats house together now and then. I think I  should play the game out, Lady Ruth, until--”    “Until what?”    “Perhaps to the end,” he answered. “Who can tell? Not I! By this time  tomorrow, it might be I who would be reminding you--”    “Yes?”    “That there are other worlds, and other lives to live!”    “I should like,” she whispered very softly, “to hear of them. But I  fancy somehow that you will never be my instructor. What of your ward?”    “Well! What of her?” he answered calmly.    She shivered a little.    “You were very frank with me once, Wingrave,” she said. “You are a man  whose life fate has wrecked, fate and I! You have no heart left, no  feeling. You can create suffering and find it amusing. I am beginning to  realize that.”    He nodded.    “There is some truth,” he declared, “In what you say.”    “What of that child? Is she, too, to be a victim?”    “I trust,” he answered, “that you are not going to be melodramatic.”    “I don’t call it that. I really want to know. I should like to warn  her.”    “I am not at war with children,” he answered. “Her life and mine are as  far apart as the poles.”    “I had an odd fancy when I saw you with her,” Lady Ruth said slowly.  “She is very good-looking--and not so absurdly young.”    “The fancy was one,” he remarked coldly, “which I think you had better  get rid of.”    “In a way,” she continued thoughtfully, “I should like to get rid of it,  and yet--how old are you, Wingrave? Well, I know. You are very little  over forty. You are barely in the prime of life, you are strong, you  have the one thing which society today counts almost divine--great,  immeasurable wealth! Can’t you find someone to thaw the snows?”    “I loved a woman once,” he answered. “It was a long time ago, and it  seems strange to me now.”    Lady Ruth lifted her eyes to his, and their lambent fires were suddenly  rekindled.    “Love her again,” she murmured. “What is past is past, but there are the  days to come! Perhaps the woman, too, is a little lonely.”    “I think not,” he answered calmly. “The woman is married, she has lived  with her husband more or less happily for a dozen years or so! She is  a little ambitious, a little fond of pleasure, but a leader of society,  and, I am sure, a very reputable member of it. To love her again would  be as embarrassing to her--as it would be difficult for me. You, my dear  Lady Ruth, I am convinced, would be the last to approve of it.”    “You mock me,” she murmured, bending her head. “Is forgiveness also an  impossibility?”    “I think,” he said, “that any sentiment whatever between those two would  be singularly misplaced. You spoke of Melba, I think! She is singing in  the further room.”    Lady Ruth rose up, still and pale. There was fear in her eyes when she  looked at him.    “Is it to be always like this, then?” she said.    “Ah!” he answered, “I am no prophet. Who can tell what the days may  bring? In the meantime...”    The Marchioness was very much in request that evening, and she found  time for only a few words with Wingrave.    “What have you been doing to poor Ruth?” she asked. “I never saw her  look so ill!”    “Indeed!” he answered, “I had not noticed it.”    “If I didn’t know her better,” she remarked, “I might begin to suspect  her of a conscience. Whose baby were you driving about this afternoon?  I didn’t know that your taste ran to ingenues to such an extent. She’s  sweetly pretty, but I don’t think it’s nice of you to flaunt her before  us middle-aged people. It’s enough to drive us to the rouge box. Come to  lunch tomorrow!”    “I shall be delighted,” he answered, and passed on.    An hour or so later, on his way out, he came upon Lady Ruth sitting a  little forlornly in the hall.    “I wonder whether I dare ask you to drop me in Cadogan Square?” she  asked. “Is it much out of your way? I am leaving a little earlier than I  expected.”    “I shall be delighted,” he answered, offering his arm.    They passed out of the door and down the covered way into the street.  A few stragglers were loitering on the pavement, and one, a tall, thin  young man in a long ulster, bent forwards as they came down the steps.  Wingrave felt his companion’s grasp tighten upon his arm; a flash of  light upon the pale features and staring eyes of the young man a few  feet off, showed him to be in the act of intercepting them. Then, at a  sharp word from Wingrave, a policeman stretched out his arm. The young  man was pushed unceremoniously away. Wingrave’s tall footman and  the policeman formed an impassable barrier--in a moment the electric  brougham was gliding down the street. Lady Ruth was leaning back amongst  the cushions, and the hand which fell suddenly upon Wingrave’s was cold  as ice!          RICHARDSON TRIES AGAIN    “You saw--who that was?”    Lady Ruth’s voice seemed to come from a greater distance. Wingrave  turned and looked at her with calm curiosity. She was leaning back in  the corner of the carriage, and she seemed somehow to have shrunk into  an unusual insignificance. Her eyes alone were clearly visible through  the semi-darkness--and the light which shone from their depths was the  light of fear.    “Yes,” he answered slowly, “I believe that I recognized him. It was the  young man who persists in some strange hallucination as to a certain  Mademoiselle Violet.”    “It was no hallucination,” she answered. “You know that! I was  Mademoiselle Violet!”    He nodded.    “It amazes me,” he said thoughtfully, “that you should have stooped to  such folly. That my demise would have been a relief to you I can, of  course, easily believe, but the means--they surely were not worthy of  your ingenuity.”    “Don’t!” she cried sharply. “I must have been utterly, miserably mad!”    “Even the greatest of schemers have their wild moments,” he remarked  consolingly. “This was one of yours. You paid me a very poor compliment,  by the bye, to imagine that an insignificant creature like that--”    “Will you--leave off?” she moaned.    “I daresay,” he continued after a moment’s pause, “that you find him now  quite an inconvenient person to deal with.”    She shuddered.    “Oh, I am paying for my folly, if that is what you mean,” she  declared. “He knows--who I am--that he was deceived. He follows me  about--everywhere.”    Wingrave glanced out of the carriage window.    “Unless I am very much surprised,” he answered, “he is following us  now!”    She came a little closer to him.    “You won’t leave me? Promise!”    “I will see you home,” he answered.    “You are coming on to Hereford House.”    “I think not,” he answered; “I have had enough of society for one  evening.”    “Emily will be there later,” she said quietly.    “Even Lady Emily,” he answered, “will not tempt me. I will see you  safely inside. Afterwards, if your persistent follower is hanging about,  I will endeavor to talk him into a more reasonable frame of mind.”    She was silent for a moment. Then she turned to him abruptly.    “You are more kind to me sometimes than I deserve, Wingrave,” she  remarked.    “It is not kindness,” he answered. “I dislike absurd situations. Here we  are! Permit me!”    Wingrave kept his word. He saw Lady Ruth to her front door, and then  turned back towards his carriage. Standing by the side of the footman, a  little breathless, haggard and disheveled-looking, was the young man who  had attempted to check their progress a few minutes ago.    Wingrave took hold of his arm firmly.    “Get in there,” he ordered, pointing to the carriage.    The young man tried to escape, but he was held as though in a vise.  Before he well knew where he was, he was in the carriage, and Wingrave  was seated by his side.    “What do you want with me?” he asked hoarsely.    “I want to know what you mean by following that lady about?” Wingrave  asked.    The young man leaned forward. His hand was upon the door.    “Let me get out,” he said sullenly.    “With pleasure--presently,” Wingrave answered. “I can assure you that I  am not anxious to detain you longer than necessary. Only you must first  answer my question.”    “I want to speak to her! I shall follow her about until I can!” the  young man declared.    Wingrave glanced at him with a faint derisive smile. His clothes were  worn and shabby, he was badly in need of a shave and a wash. He sat  hunched up in a corner of the carriage, the picture of mute discomfort  and misery.    “Do you know who she is?” Wingrave asked.    “Mademoiselle Violet!” the young man answered.    “You are mistaken,” Wingrave answered. “She is Lady Ruth Barrington,  wife of Lumley Barrington and daughter of the Earl of Haselton.”    The young man was unmoved.    “She is Mademoiselle Violet,” he declared.    The coupe drew up before the great block of buildings in which was  Wingrave’s flat. The footman threw open the door.    “Come in with me,” Wingrave said. “I have something more to say to you.”    “I would rather not,” the young man muttered, and would have slouched  off, but Wingrave caught him by the arm.    “Come!” he said firmly, and the youth obeyed.    Wingrave led the way into his sitting room and dismissed his servant who  was setting out a tray upon the sideboard.    “Sit down,” he ordered, and his strange guest again obeyed. Wingrave  looked at him critically.    “It seems to me,” he said deliberately, “that you are another of those  poor fools who chuck away their life and happiness and go to the dogs  because a woman had chosen to make a little use of them. You’re out of  work, I suppose?”    “Yes!”    “Hungry?”    “I suppose so.”    Wingrave brought a plate of sandwiches from the sideboard, and mixed a  whisky and soda. He set them down in front of his guest, and turned away  with the evening paper in his hand.    “I am going into the next room for some cigarettes,” he remarked.    He was gone scarcely two minutes. When he returned, the room was in  darkness. He moved suddenly towards the electric lights, but was pushed  back by an unseen hand. A man’s hot breath fell upon his cheek, a  hoarse, rasping voice spoke to him out of the black shadows.    “Don’t touch the lights! Don’t touch the lights, I say!”    “What folly is this?” Wingrave asked angrily. “Are you mad?”    “Not now,” came the quick answer. “I have been. It has come to me here,  in the darkness. I know why she is angry, I know why she will not speak  to me. It is--because I failed.”    Wingrave laughed, and moved towards the lights.    “We have had enough of this tomfoolery,” he said scornfully. “If you  won’t listen to reason--”    He never finished his sentence. He had stumbled suddenly against a soft  body, he had a momentary impression of a white, vicious face, of eyes  blazing with insane fury. Quick to act, he struck--but before his hand  descended, he had felt the tearing of his shirt, the sharp, keen pain  in his chest, the swimming of his senses. Yet even then he struck again  with passionate anger, and his assailant went down amongst the chairs  with a dull, sickening crash!    Then there was silence in the room. Wingrave made an effort to drag  himself a yard or two towards the bell, but collapsed hopelessly.  Richardson, in a few moments, staggered to his feet.    He groped his way to the side of the wall, and found the knobs of the  electric lights. He turned two on and looked around him. Wingrave was  lying a few yards off, with a small red stain upon his shirt front.  His face was ghastly pale, and he was breathing thickly. The young man  looked at him for several moments, and then made his way to the side  table where the sandwiches were. One by one he took them from the dish,  and ate deliberately. When he had finished, he made his way once more  towards where Wingrave lay. But before he reached the spot, he stopped  short. Something on the wall had attracted his attention. He put his  hand to his head and thought for a moment. It was an idea--a glorious  idea.         . . . . . . . . . . . .    Lady Ruth’s maid stepped back and surveyed her mistress ecstatically.    “Milady,” she declared, “has never, no never, appeared more charming.  The gown, it is divine--and the coiffure! Milady will have no rivals.”    Lady Ruth looked at herself long and earnestly in the glass. Her face  reflected none of the pleased interest with which her maid was still  regarding her. The latter grew a little anxious.    “Milady thinks herself a trifle pale, perhaps--a little more color?”    Lady Ruth set down the glass.    “No, thank you, Annette,” she answered. “I shall do very well, I  suppose. Certainly, I won’t have any rouge.”    “Milady knows very well what becomes her,” the woman answered  discreetly. “The pallor, it is the more distinguished. Milady cannot  fail to have all the success she desires!”    Lady Ruth smiled a little wearily. And at that moment, there came a  knock at the door. A servant entered.    “Someone wishes to speak to your ladyship on the telephone,” the girl  announced.    “On the telephone, at this time of night?” Lady Ruth exclaimed.  “Ridiculous! They must send a message, whoever they are!”    “Parkins told them so, your ladyship,” the girl answered; “but they  insisted that the matter was important. They would give no name, but  said that they were speaking from Mr. Wingrave’s rooms.”    Lady Ruth raised her eyebrows.    “It is very extraordinary,” she said coldly, “but I will come to the  telephone.”          “IT WAS AN ACCIDENT”    Lady Ruth took up the receiver. Some instinct seemed to have prompted  her to close the door of the study.    “Who is there?” she asked. “Who is it that wants me?”    A thin, unfamiliar voice answered her.    “Is that Lady Ruth Barrington?”    “Yes!”    “Is it--Mademoiselle Violet?”    The receiver nearly dropped from her hand.    “I don’t understand you,” she answered, “I am Lady Ruth Barrington! Who  are you?”    “You are Mademoiselle Violet,” was the answer, “and you know who I am!  Listen, I am in Mr. Wingrave’s rooms.”    She would have liked to have rung off and gone away, but it seemed a  sheer impossibility for her to move! And all the time her knees were  shaking, and the fear of evil things was in her heart.    “What are you doing there?” she asked.    “He brought me in himself,” the thin voice answered. “Can you hear me?  I don’t want to speak any louder for fear anyone else should be  listening.”    “Yes, I can hear,” she answered. “But how dared you ring me up? Say what  you desire to quickly! I am going away.”    “Wait, please,” the voice answered. “I know why you have been angry with  me. I know why you have kept away from me, why you have been so cruel!  It was because I failed. Was it not, dear Mademoiselle Violet?”    She had not the breath or the courage to answer him. In a moment or two  he continued, and there was a note of suppressed exultation in his tone.    “Listen! This time--I have not failed!”    She nearly screamed. The receiver in her hand burned like a live thing.  Her eyes were set in a fixed and awful stare as though she were trying  to see for herself outside the walls of the little room where she stood  into the larger chamber from which the voice--that awful voice--came!  Her own words were hysterical and uncertain, but she managed to falter  them out at last.    “What do you mean? Where is Mr. Wingrave? Tell me at once!”    The voice, without being raised, seemed to take to itself a note of  triumph.    “He is dying--on the floor--just here! Listen hard! Perhaps you can hear  him groan! Now will you believe that I am not a coward?”    Her shriek drowned his words. She flung the receiver from her with a  crash and rushed from the room into the hall. She brushed past her maid  with a wild gesture.    “Never mind my wraps. Open the door, Parkins! Is the carriage waiting?”    “Yes, Milady! Shall--”    But she was past him and down the steps.    “No. 18, Grosvenor Mansions,” she cried to the man. “Drive fast.”    The man obeyed. The servants, who had come to the door, stood there  a little frightened group. She ignored them and everything else  completely. The carriage had scarcely stopped when she sprang out and  crossed the pavement in a few hasty steps. The tall commissionaire  looked in amazement at her. She wore an opera cloak--she was a  bewildering vision of white satin and diamonds, and her eyes were  terrible with the fear which was in her heart.    She clutched him by the arm.    “Come up with me to Mr. Wingrave’s rooms,” she exclaimed. “Something  terrible has happened. I heard through the telephone.”    The man dashed up the stairs by her side. Wingrave’s suite was on the  first floor, and they did not wait for the lift. The commissionaire  put his finger on the bell of the outside door. She leaned forward,  listening breathlessly. Inside all was silence except for the shrill  clamor of the bell.    “Go on ringing,” she said breathlessly. “Don’t leave off!”    The man looked at her curiously. “Mr. Wingrave came in about an hour ago  with a young man, madam,” he said.    “Yes, yes!” she cried. “Listen! There’s someone coming.”    They heard a hesitating step inside. The door was cautiously opened. It  was Richardson, pale, disheveled, but triumphant, who peered out.    “Mademoiselle--Mademoiselle Violet,” he cried. “You have come to see for  yourself. This way!”    She raised her arm and struck him across the face so that, with a little  moan, he staggered back against the wall. Then she hastened forward into  the room towards which he had pointed and the door of which stood open.  The commissionaire followed her. The servants were beginning to appear.    The room was in darkness save for one electric light. A groan, however,  directed them. She fell on her knees by Wingrave’s prostrate figure and  raised his head slightly. His servant, too, was hurrying forward. She  looked up.    “Get me some brandy,” she ordered. “Send someone for a doctor. Don’t let  that young man escape. The brandy, quick!”    She forced some between his lips. There was already a spot of blood upon  the gown which, a few minutes ago, had seemed so immaculate. One of the  ornaments fell from her hair. It lay unnoticed by her side. Suddenly  Wingrave opened his eyes. She saw at once that he was conscious and that  he recognized her.    “Don’t move, please,” she begged. “It will be better for you not to  speak. The doctor will be here directly.”    He nodded.    “I don’t think that I am much hurt,” he said slowly. “Your young friend  was a born bungler!”    She shuddered, but said nothing.    “How on earth,” he asked, “did you get here?”    She whispered in his ear.    “The brute--telephoned. Please don’t talk.”    The doctor arrived. His examination was over in a few moments.    “Nothing serious,” he declared. “The knife was pretty blunt fortunately.  How did it happen? It seems like a case for the police.”    “It was an accident,” Wingrave declared coolly.    The doctor shrugged his shoulders. He was busy making bandages. Lady  Ruth rose to her feet. She was white and giddy. The commissionaire and  Morrison were talking together at the door. The latter turned to Lady  Ruth.    “Do you think that we had better send for the police, your ladyship?” he  asked. “It was the young man who came in with Mr. Wingrave who must have  done this! I thought he was a very wild-looking sort of person.”    “You heard what Mr. Wingrave said,” she answered. “I don’t think that I  should disobey him, if I were you. The doctor says that, after all, it  is not very serious.”    “He can’t have got far,” the hall porter remarked. “He only slipped out  as we came in.”    “I should let him go for the present,” Lady Ruth said. “If Mr. Wingrave  wishes to prosecute afterwards, it will be easy for him to do so.”    She stepped back to where Wingrave lay. He was in a recumbent position  now and, although a little pale, he was obviously not seriously hurt.    “If there is nothing else that I can do,” she said, “I will go now!”    “By all means,” Wingrave answered. “I am exceedingly obliged to you  for your kindness,” he added a little stiffly. “Morrison, show Lady  Barrington to her carriage!”    She spoke a few conventional words of farewell and departed. Outside on  the pavement she stood for a moment, looking carefully around. There was  no sign of Richardson anywhere! She stepped into the carriage and leaned  back in the corner.          AYNESWORTH PLANS A LOVE STORY    Wingrave disappeared suddenly from London. Aynesworth alone knew where  he was gone, and he was pledged to secrecy. Two people received letters  from him. Lady Ruth was one of them.    “This,” she remarked quietly, handing it over to her husband, “may  interest you.”    He adjusted his eye glasses and read it aloud:--    “Dear Lady Ruth,--I am leaving London today for several weeks. With the  usual inconsistency of the person to whom life is by no means a valuable  asset, I am obeying the orders of my physician. I regret, therefore,  that I cannot have the pleasure of entertaining your husband and  yourself during Cowes week. The yacht, however, is entirely at your  disposal, and I have written Captain Masterton to that effect. Pray  extend your cruise, if you feel inclined to.--I remain, yours sincerely,  W.”    Mr. Barrington looked at his wife inquiringly.    “That seems to me entirely satisfactory, Ruth,” he said. “I think that  he might have added a word or two of acknowledgment for what you did for  him. There is no doubt that, but for your promptness, things might have  gone much worse.”    “Yes,” Lady Ruth said slowly, “I think that he might have added a few  words.”    Her husband regarded her critically.    “I am afraid, dear,” he said, “that all this anxiety has knocked you up  a little. You are not looking well.”    “I am tired,” she answered calmly. “It has been a long season. I should  like to do what Wingrave has done--go away somewhere and rest.”    Barrington laid his hand upon hers affectionately. It seemed to him that  the rings hung a little loosely upon the thin, white fingers. She was  pale, too, and her eyes were weary. He did not notice that, as soon as  she could, she drew her hand away.    “Pon my word,” he said, “I wish we could go off somewhere by ourselves.  But with Wingrave’s yacht to entertain on, we must do something for a  few of the people. I don’t suppose he minds whom we ask, or how many.”    “No!” she answered, “I do not suppose he cares.”    “It is most opportune,” Barrington declared. “I wanted particularly to  do something for the Hendersons. He seems very well disposed, and his  influence means everything just now. Really, Ruth, I believe we are  going to pull through after all.”    She smiled a little wearily.    “Do you think so, Lumley?”    “I am sure of it, Ruth,” he answered. “I only wish I could see you a  little more cheerful. Surely you can’t still--be afraid of Wingrave,” he  added, glancing uneasily across the table.    She looked him in the eyes.    “That is exactly what I am,” she answered. “I am afraid of him. I have  always been afraid. Nothing has happened to change him. He came back to  have his revenge. He will have it.”    Lumley Barrington, for once, felt himself superior to his clever wife.  He smiled upon her reassuringly.    “My dear Ruth,” he said, “if only you would reflect for a few moments,  I feel sure you would realize the absurdity of such fancies. We did  Wingrave a service in introducing him to society here, and I am sure  that he appreciated it. If he wished for our ruin, why did he lend us  eight thousand pounds on no security? Why does he lend us his yacht to  entertain our friends? Why did he give me that information which enabled  me to make the only money I ever did make on the Stock Exchange?”    She smiled contemptuously.    “You do not understand a man like Wingrave,” she declared. “Nothing that  he has done is inconsistent with my point of view. He gave you a safe  tip, knowing very well that when you had won a little, you would try  again on your own account and lose--which you did. He lent us the money  to become our creditor; and he lends us the yacht to give another handle  to the people who are saying already that he occupies the position  in our family which is more fully recognized on the other side of the  Channel!”    “You are talking rubbish,” he declared vehemently. “No one would dare to  say such a thing of you--of my wife!”    She laughed unmercifully.    “If you were not my husband,” she said cruelly, “you would have heard  it before now. I have been careful all my life--more careful than most  women, but I can hear the whisperings already. There are more ways to  ruin than one, Lumley.”    “We will refuse the yacht,” Barrington said sullenly, “and I will go to  the Jews for that eight thousand pounds.”    “We will do nothing of the sort,” Lady Ruth answered. “I am not going  to be a laughing stock for Emily and her friends if I can help it.  We’ll play the game through now! Only--it is best for you to know the  risks...”    Wingrave’s second letter was to Juliet. She found it on her table one  afternoon when she came back from her painting class. She tore it open  eagerly enough, but her face clouded over as she read.    “Dear Juliet,--I am sorry that I am unable to carry out my promise to  come and see you, but I have been slightly indisposed for some days, and  am leaving London, for the present, almost at once. I trust that you are  still interested in your work, and will enjoy your trip to Normandy.    “I received your letter, asking for my help towards re-establishing in  life a poor family in whom you are interested. I regret that I cannot  accede to your request. It is wholly against my principles to give money  away to people of this class. I look upon all charity as a mischievous  attempt to tamper with natural laws, and I am convinced that if everyone  shared my views, society would long ago have been re-established on  a sounder and more logical basis. To be quite frank with you, also, I  might add that the gift of sympathy has been denied to me. I am quite  indifferent whether the family you allude to starve or prosper.    “So far as you yourself are concerned, however, the matter is entirely  different. If it gives you pleasure to assist in pauperizing any number  of your fellow creatures, pray do so. I enclose a check for L100. It is  a present to you. Use it entirely as you please--only, if you use it  for the purpose suggested in your letter to me, remember that the  responsibility is yours, and yours alone.--I remain, sincerely yours,  Wingrave Seton.”    Juliet walked straight to her writing table. Her cheeks were flushed,  and her eyes were wet with tears. She drew out a sheet of note paper and  wrote rapidly:--    “My dear guardian,--I return you the check. I cannot accept such  presents after all your goodness to me. I am sorry that you feel as you  do about giving money away. You are so much older and wiser than I am  that I dare not attempt to argue with you. Only it seems to me that life  would be a cruelly selfish thing if we who are so much more fortunate  than many of our fellow creatures did not sometimes try to help them a  little through their misery. Perhaps I feel this a little more keenly  because I wonder sometimes what might not have become of me but for your  goodness.    “I am sorry that you are going away without coming to see me again.  You are not displeased with me, I hope, for asking you this, or for any  other reason? I am foolish enough to feel a little lonely sometimes.  Will you take me out again when you come back?--Your affectionate ward,  Juliet.”    Juliet went out and posted her letter. On the way back she met  Aynesworth.    “Come and sit in the Park for a few minutes,” he begged.    She turned and walked by his side willingly enough.    “Have you been in to see me?” she asked.    “Yes!” he answered. “I have some tickets for the Haymarket for tonight.  Do you think we could persuade Mrs. Tresfarwin to come?”    “I’m sure we could,” she answered, laughing. “Hannah never wants any  persuading. How nice of you to think of us!”    “I am afraid,” he answered, “that I think of you a good deal.”    “Then I think that that also is very nice of you!” she declared.    “You like to be thought of?”    “Who doesn’t? What is the play tonight?”    “I’ll tell you about it afterwards,” he said. “There is something else I  want to say to you first.”    She nodded. She scarcely showed so much interest as he would have liked.    “It is about Berneval,” he said, keeping his eyes fixed upon her face.  “I saw Mr. Pleydell today, and he told me that you were all going there.  He suggested that I should come too!”    “How delightful!” she exclaimed. “Can you really get off?”    “Yes. Sir Wingrave is going away, and doesn’t want me. I must go  somewhere, and I thought that I might go over and take rooms near you  all. Would you care to have me?”    “Of course I would,” she answered frankly. “Oh!” she exclaimed suddenly,  her face clouding over--“I forgot!”    “Well?”    “I am not sure,” she said, “that I am going.”    “Not going?” he repeated incredulously. “Mr. Pleydell told me that it  was all arranged.”    “It was--until today,” she said. “I am a little uncertain now.”    He looked at her perplexed.    “May I know why?” he asked.    She raised her eyebrows slightly.    “You are rather an inquisitive person,” she remarked. “The fact is, I  may need the money I have saved for Berneval for somewhere else.”    “Of course,” he said slowly, “if you don’t go--I don’t. But you can’t  stay in London all through the hot weather!”    “Miss Pengarth has asked me to go down there,” she said.    He laid his hand suddenly upon hers.    “Juliet,” he said.    She shook her head.    “Miss Lundy, please!”    “Well, Miss Lundy then! May I talk to you seriously?”    “I prefer you frivolous,” she murmured. “I like to be amused.”    “I’ll be frivolous enough later on this evening. I’ve been wondering  if you’d think it impertinent if I asked you to tell me about your  guardian.”    “What do you want to know?” she asked.    “Just who he is, and why he is content to let you live with only an old  woman to look after you. It isn’t the best thing in the world for you,  is it? I should like to know him, Juliet.”    She shook her head.    “I am sorry,” she said, “I cannot tell you anything.”    There was a short silence. Aynesworth was disappointed, and showed it.    “It isn’t exactly ordinary curiosity,” he continued. “Don’t think that!  Only I feel that you need someone who has the right to advise you and  look after you. I should like to be your guardian, Juliet!”    She laughed merrily.    “Good!” she declared. “I like you so much better frivolous. Well, you  shall have your wish. You shall be my guardian for the evening. I have  one cutlet for dinner, and I am sure it will be spoilt. Will you come  and share it?”    She rose to her feet and stood looking down upon him. He was struck, for  the first time, by something different in her appearance. The smooth,  delicate girlishness of her young face was, as yet, untroubled. Her eyes  laughed frankly into his, and all the grace of natural childhood seemed  still to linger about her. And yet--there was a change! Understanding  was there; understanding, with sorrow in its wake. Aynesworth was  suddenly anxious. Had anything happened of which he was ignorant? He  rose up slowly. He was sure of himself now! Was he sure of her?          A DEED OF GIFT    Wingrave threw the paper aside with an impatient exclamation. A small  notice in an obscure corner had attracted his attention; the young man,  Richardson, had been fished out of the river half drowned, and in view  of his tearful and abject penitence, had been allowed to go his way by  a lenient magistrate. He had been ill, he pleaded, and disappointed. His  former employer, in an Islington emporium, gave him a good character,  and offered to take him back. So that was an end of Mr. Richardson, and  the romance of his days!    A worm like that to have brought him--the strong man, low! Wingrave  thought with sullen anger as he leaned back in his chair with  half-closed eyes. Here was an undignified hiatus, if not a finale, to  all his schemes, to the even tenor of his self-restrained, purposeful  life! The west wind was rippling through the orchards which bordered  the garden. The muffled roar of the Atlantic was in his ears, a strange  everlasting background to all the slighter summer sounds, the murmuring  of insects, the calling of birds, the melodious swish of the whirling  knives in the distant hayfield. Wingrave was alone with his thoughts,  and he hated them!    Even Mr. Pengarth was welcome, Mr. Pengarth very warm from his ride,  carrying his hat and a small black bag in his hand. As he drew nearer,  he became hotter and was obliged to rest his bag upon the path and mop  his forehead. He was more afraid of his client than of anything else in  the world.    “Good afternoon, Sir Wingrave,” he said. “I trust that you are feeling  better today.”    Wingrave eyed him coldly. He did not reply to the inquiry as to his  health.    “You have brought the deed?” he asked.    “Certainly, Sir Wingrave.”    The lawyer produced a roll of parchment from his bag. In response to  Wingrave’s gesture, he seated himself on the extreme edge of an adjacent  seat.    “I do not propose to read all that stuff through,” Wingrave remarked.  “I take it for granted that the deed is made out according to my  instructions.”    “Certainly, Sir Wingrave!”    “Then we will go into the house, and I will sign it.”    Mr. Pengarth mopped his forehead once more. It was a terrible thing to  have a conscience.    “Sir Wingrave,” he said, “I apologize most humbly for what I am about to  say, but as the agent of your estates in this county and your--er--legal  adviser with regard to them, I am forced to ask you whether you are  quite determined upon this--most unexampled piece of generosity.  Tredowen has been in your mother’s family for a great many years, and  although I must say that I have a great affection for this young lady,  I have also an old fashioned dislike to seeing--er--family property pass  into the hands of strangers. You might, forgive me--marry!”    Wingrave smiled very faintly, otherwise his face was inscrutable.    “I might,” he admitted calmly, “but I shall not. Do you consider me, Mr.  Pengarth, to be a person in possession of his usual faculties?”    “Oh, most certainly--most certainly,” the lawyer declared emphatically.    “Then please do not question my instructions any further. So far as  regards the pecuniary part of it, I am a richer man than you have any  idea of, Mr. Pengarth, and for the rest--sentiment unfortunately  does not appeal to me. I choose to give the Tredowen estates away, to  disappoint my next of kin. That is how you may regard the transaction.  We will go into the house and complete this deed.”    Wingrave rose slowly and walked with some difficulty up the gravel path.  He ignored, however, his companion’s timid offer of help, and led  the way to the library. In a few minutes the document was signed and  witnessed.    “I have ordered tea in the garden,” Wingrave said, as the two  servants left the room; “that is, unless you prefer any other sort of  refreshment. I don’t know much about the cellars, but there is some  cabinet hock, I believe--”    Mr. Pengarth interposed.    “I am very much obliged,” he said, “but I will not intrude upon you  further. If you will allow me, I will ring the bell for my trap.”    “You will do nothing of the sort,” Wingrave answered testily. “You will  stay here and talk to me.”    “I will stay with pleasure if you desire it,” the lawyer answered. “I  had an idea that you preferred solitude.”    “Then you were wrong,” Wingrave answered. “I hate being alone.”    They moved out together towards the garden. Tea was set out in a shady  corner of the lawn.    “If you will forgive my remarking it,” Mr. Pengarth said, “this seems  rather an extraordinary place for you to come to if you really dislike  solitude.”    “I come to escape from an intolerable situation, and because I was ill,”   Wingrave said.    “You might have brought friends,” the lawyer suggested.    “I have no friends,” Wingrave answered.    “Some of the people in the neighborhood would be very glad--” Mr.  Pengarth began.    “I do not wish to see them,” Wingrave answered.    Mr. Pengarth took a peach, and held his tongue. Wingrave broke the  silence which followed a little abruptly.    “Tell me, Mr. Pengarth,” he said, “do I look like a man likely to fail  in anything he sets out to accomplish?”    The lawyer shook his head vigorously.    “You do not,” he declared.    “Nor do I feel like one,” Wingrave said, “and yet my record since I  commenced, shall I call it my second life, is one of complete failure!  Nothing that I planned have I been able to accomplish. I look back  through the months and through the years, and I see not a single purpose  carried out, not a single scheme successful.    “Not quite so bad as that, I trust, Sir Wingrave,” the lawyer protested.    “It is the precise truth,” Wingrave affirmed drily. “I am losing  confidence in myself.”    “At least,” the lawyer declared, “you have been the salvation of our  dear Miss Juliet, if I may call her so. But for you, her life would have  been ruined.”    “Precisely,” Wingrave agreed. “But I forgot! You don’t understand! I  have saved her from heaven knows what! I am going to give her the home  she loves! Benevolence, isn’t it? And yet, if I had only the pluck, I  might succeed even now--so far as she is concerned.”    The lawyer took off his spectacles and rubbed them with his  handkerchief. He was thoroughly bewildered.    “I might succeed,” Wingrave repeated, leaning back in his chair, “if  only--”    His face darkened. It seemed to Mr. Pengarth as he sipped his tea under  the cool cedars, drawing in all their wonderful perfume with every puff  of breeze, that he saw two men in the low invalid’s chair before him. He  saw the breath and desire of evil things struggling with some wonderful  dream vainly seeking to realize itself.    “Some of us,” the lawyer said timidly, “build our ideals too high up in  the clouds, so that to reach them is very difficult. Nevertheless, the  effort counts.”    Wingrave laughed mockingly.    “It is not like that with me,” he declared. “My plans were made down in  hell.”    “God bless my soul!” the lawyer murmured. “But you are not serious, Sir  Wingrave?”    “Ay! I’m serious enough,” Wingrave answered. “Do you suppose a man, with  the best pages of his life rooted out, is likely to look out upon his  fellows from the point of view of a philanthropist? Do you suppose that  the man, into whose soul the irons of bitterness have gnawed and eaten  their way, is likely to come out with a smirk and look around him for  the opportunity of doing good? Rubbish! My aim is to encourage suffering  wherever I see it, to create it where I can, to make sinners and thieves  of honest people.”    “God bless my soul!” the lawyer gasped again. “I don’t think you can  be--as bad as you think you are. What about Juliet Lundy?”    Fire flashed in Wingrave’s eyes. Again, at the mention of her name, he  seemed almost to lose control of himself. It was several moments before  he spoke. He looked Mr. Pengarth in the face, and his tone was unusually  deliberate.    “Gifts,” he said, “are not always given in friendship. Life may easily  become a more complicated affair for that child with the Tredowen  estates hanging round her neck. And anyhow, I disappoint my next of  kin.”    Morrison, smooth-footed and silent, appeared upon the lawn. He addressed  Wingrave.    “A lady has arrived in a cab from Truro, sir,” he announced. “She wishes  to see you as soon as convenient.”    A sudden light flashed across Wingrave’s face, dying out again almost  immediately.    “Who is she, Morrison?” he asked.    The man glanced at Mr. Pengarth.    “She did not give her name, sir.”    Mr. Pengarth and Wingrave both rose. The former at once made his adieux  and took a short cut to the stables. Wingrave, who leaned heavily upon  his stick, clutched Morrison by the arm.    “Who is it, Morrison?” he demanded.    “It is Lady Ruth Barrington, sir,” the man answered.    “Alone?”    “Quite alone, sir.”          FOR PITY’S SAKE    The library at Tredowen was a room of irregular shape, full of angles  and recesses lined with bookcases. It was in one of these, standing  motionless before a small marble statue of some forgotten Greek poet,  that Wingrave found his visitor. She wore a plain serge traveling dress,  and the pallor of her face, from which she had just lifted a voluminous  veil, matched almost in color the gleaming white marble upon which  she was gazing. But when she saw Wingrave, leaning upon his stick, and  regarding her with stern surprise, strange lights seemed to flash in  her eyes. There was no longer any resemblance between the pallor of her  cheeks and the pallor of the statue.    “Lady Ruth,” Wingrave said quietly, “I do not understand what has  procured for me the pleasure of this unexpected visit.”    She swayed a little towards him. Her head was thrown back, all the  silent passion of the inexpressible, the hidden secondary forces of  nature, was blazing out of her eyes, pleading with him in the broken  music of her tone.    “You do not understand,” she repeated. “Ah, no! But can I make you  understand? Will you listen to me for once as a human being? Will  you remember that you are a man, and I a woman pleading for a little  mercy--a little kindness?”    Wingrave moved a step further back.    “Permit me,” he said, “to offer you a chair.”    She sank into it--speechless for a moment. Wingrave stood over her,  leaning slightly against the corner of the bookcase.    “I trust,” he said, “that you will explain what all this means. If it is  my help which you require--”    Her hands flashed out towards him--a gesture almost of horror.    “Don’t,” she begged, “you know that it is not that! You know very well  that it is not. Why do you torture me?”    “I can only ask you,” he said, “to explain.”    She commenced talking quickly. Her sentences came in little gasps.    “You wanted revenge--not in the ordinary way. You had brooded over it  too long. You understood too well. Once it was I who sought to revenge  myself on you because you would not listen to me! You hurt my pride.  Everything that was evil in me rebelled--”    “Is this necessary?” he interrupted coldly. “I have never reproached  you. You chose the path of safety for yourself. Many another woman in  your place would doubtless have done the same thing! What I desire to  know is why you are here in Cornwall. What has happened to make this  journey seem necessary to you?”    “Listen!” she continued. “I want you to know how thoroughly you have  succeeded. Before you came, Lumley and I were living together decently  enough, and, as hundreds of others live, with outside interests for  our chief distraction. You came, a friend! You were very subtle, very  skillful! You never spoke a word of affection to me, but you managed  things so that--people talked. You encouraged Lumley to speculate--not  in actual words, perhaps, but by suggestion. Then you lent me money.  Lumley, my husband, let me borrow from you. Everyone knew that we were  ruined; everyone knew where the money came from that set us right. So  misery has been piled upon misery. Lumley has lost his self respect, he  is losing his ambition, he is deteriorating every day. I--how can I do  anything else but despise him? He let me, his wife, come to your rooms  to borrow money from you. Do you think I can ever forget that? Do you  think that he can? Don’t you know that the memory of it is dragging us  apart, must keep us apart always--always?”    Wingrave leaned a little forward. His hands were clasped upon the handle  of his stick.    “All that you tell me,” he remarked coldly, “might equally well have  been said in London! I do not wish to seem inhospitable, but I am still  waiting to know why you have taken an eight hours’ journey to recite a  few fairly obvious truths. Your relations with your husband, frankly, do  not interest me. The deductions which society may have drawn concerning  our friendship need scarcely trouble you, under the circumstances.”    Then again the light was blazing in her eyes.    “Under the circumstances!” she repeated. “I know what you mean. It is  true that you have asked for nothing. It is true that all this time you  have never spoken a single word which all the world might not hear, you  have never even touched my fingers, except as a matter of formality.  Once I was the woman you loved--and I--well you know! Is this part of  your scheme of torture, to play with me as though we were marionettes,  you and I, with sawdust in our veins, dull, lifeless puppets! Well, it  is finished--your vengeance! You may reap the harvest when you will!  Publish my letters, prove yourself an injured man. Take a whip in your  hand if you like, and I will never flinch. But, for heaven’s sake,  remember that I am a woman! I am willing to be your slave, nurse you,  wait upon you, follow you about! What more can your vengeance need? You  have made me despise my husband, you have made me hate my life with  him! You have forced me into a remembrance of what I have never really  forgotten--and oh! Wingrave,” she added, opening her arms to him with  a little sob, “if you send me away, I think that I shall kill myself.  Wingrave!”    There was a note of despair in her last cry. Her arms fell to her side.  Wingrave was on his way to the further end of the room. He rang the bell  and turned towards her.    “Listen,” he said calmly, “you will return to London tonight. If ever  I require you, I shall send for you--and you will come. At present I do  not. You will return to your husband. Understand!”    “Yes,” she gasped, “but--”    He held out his hand. Morrison was at the door.    “Morrison,” he said, “you will order the motor to be round in half an  hour to take Lady Ruth to Truro, She has to catch the London express.  You will go with her yourself, and see that she has a reserved carriage.  If, by any chance, you should miss the train, order a special.”    “Very good, sir.”    “And tell the cook to send in tea and wine, and some sandwiches, in ten  minutes.”    Once more they were alone. Lady Ruth rose slowly to her feet and,  trembling in every limb, she walked down the room and fell on her knees  before Wingrave.    “Wingrave,” she said, “I will go away. I will do all that you tell me;  I will wear my chains bravely, and hold my peace. But before I go, for  heaven’s sake, say a kind word, look at me kindly, kiss me, hold my  hands; anything, anything, anything to prove to me that you are not  a dead man. I could bear unkindness, reproaches, abuse. I can bear  anything but this deadly coldness. It is becoming a horror to me! Do,  Wingrave--do!”    She clasped his hand--he drew it calmly away.    “Lady Ruth,” he said, “you have spoken the truth. I am a dead man. I  have ",55.47,10.1,11.5,8.25,12.1,5.77,1502,11.0,12.02,11th and 12th grade
12,Some Reminiscencesr,"sit down in the window with a book and let them  clear the table when they liked; but if you think that on that morning  I was in the least impatient, you are mistaken. I remember that I was  perfectly calm. As a matter of fact I was not at all certain that I  wanted to write, or that I meant to write, or that I had anything to  write about. No, I was not impatient. I lounged between the mantelpiece  and the window, not even consciously waiting for the table to be  cleared. It was ten to one that before my landlady's daughter was done I  would pick up a book and sit down with it all the morning in a spirit of  enjoyable indolence. I affirm it with assurance, and I don't even know  now what were the books then lying about the room. Whatever they were  they were not the works of great masters, where the secret of clear  thought and exact expression can be found. Since the age of five I have  been a great reader, as is not perhaps wonderful in a child who was  never aware of learning to read. At ten years of age I had read much  of Victor Hugo and other romantics. I had read in Polish and in French,  history, voyages, novels; I knew �Gil Blas� and �Don Quixote� in  abridged editions; I had read in early boyhood Polish poets and some  French poets, but I cannot say what I read on the evening before I began  to write myself. I believe it was a novel and it is quite possible  that it was one of Anthony Trollope's novels. It is very likely. My  acquaintance with him was then very recent. He is one of the English  novelists whose works I read for the first time in English. With men of  European reputation, with Dickens and Walter Scott and Thackeray, it was  otherwise. My first introduction to English imaginative literature was  �Nicholas Nickleby.� It is extraordinary how well Mrs. Nickleby could  chatter disconnectedly in Polish and the sinister Ralph rage in that  language. As to the Crummles family and the family of the learned  Squeers it seemed as natural to them as their native speech. It was, I  have no doubt, an excellent translation. This must have been in the year  '70. But I really believe that I am wrong. That book was not my first  introduction to English literature. My first acquaintance was (or were)  the �Two Gentlemen of Verona,� and that in the very MS. of my father's  translation. It was during our exile in Russia, and it must have been  less than a year after my mother's death, because I remember myself  in the black blouse with a white border of my heavy mourning. We were  living together, quite alone, in a small house on the outskirts of the  town of T--. That afternoon, instead of going out to play in the large  yard which we shared with our landlord, I had lingered in the room in  which my father generally wrote. What emboldened me to clamber into  his chair I am sure I don't know, but a couple of hours afterwards he  discovered me kneeling in it with my elbows on the table and my head  held in both hands over the MS. of loose pages. I was greatly confused,  expecting to get into trouble. He stood in the doorway looking at me  with some surprise, but the only thing he said after a moment of silence  was:    �Read the page aloud.�    Luckily the page lying before me was not overblotted with erasures  and corrections, and my father's handwriting was otherwise extremely  legible. When I got to the end he nodded and I flew out of doors  thinking myself lucky to have escaped reproof for that piece of  impulsive audacity. I have tried to discover since the reason of this  mildness, and I imagine that all unknown to myself I had earned, in  my father's mind, the right to some latitude in my relations with his  writing-table. It was only a month before, or perhaps it was only a week  before, that I had read to him aloud from beginning to end, and to his  perfect satisfaction, as he lay on his bed, not being very well at the  time, the proofs of his translation of Victor Hugo's �Toilers of the  Sea.� Such was my title to consideration, I believe, and also my first  introduction to the sea in literature. If I do not remember where, how  and when I learned to read, I am not likely to forget the process of  being trained in the art of reading aloud. My poor father, an admirable  reader himself, was the most exacting of masters. I reflect proudly that  I must have read that page of �Two Gentlemen of Verona� tolerably well  at the age of eight. The next time I met them was in a 5s. one-volume  edition of the dramatic works of William Shakespeare, read in Falmouth,  at odd moments of the day, to the noisy accompaniment of caulkers'  mallets driving oakum into the deck-seams of a ship in dry dock. We had  run in, in a sinking condition and with the crew refusing duty after a  month of weary battling with the gales of the North Atlantic. Books are  an integral part of one's life and my Shakespearean associations are  with that first year of our bereavement, the last I spent with my father  in exile (he sent me away to Poland to my mother's brother directly he  could brace himself up for the separation), and with the year of hard  gales, the year in which I came nearest to death at sea, first by water  and then by fire.    Those things I remember, but what I was reading the day before my  writing life began I have forgotten. I have only a vague notion that it  might have been one of Trollope's political novels. And I remember,  too, the character of the day. It was an autumn day with an opaline  atmosphere, a veiled, semi-opaque, lustrous day, with fiery points and  flashes of red sunlight on the roofs and windows opposite, while the  trees of the square with all their leaves gone were like tracings of  indian ink on a sheet of tissue paper. It was one of those London days  that have the charm of mysterious amenity, of fascinating softness.  The effect of opaline mist was often repeated at Bessborough Gardens on  account of the nearness to the river.    There is no reason why I should remember that effect more on that day  than on any other day, except that I stood for a long time looking out  of the window after the landlady's daughter was gone with her spoil  of cups and saucers. I heard her put the tray down in the passage and  finally shut the door; and still I remained smoking with my back to the  room. It is very clear that I was in no haste to take the plunge into my  writing life, if as plunge this first attempt may be described. My whole  being was steeped deep in the indolence of a sailor away from the  sea, the scene of never-ending labour and of unceasing duty. For utter  surrender to indolence you cannot beat a sailor ashore when that mood  is on him, the mood of absolute irresponsibility tasted to the full.  It seems to me that I thought of nothing whatever, but this is an  impression which is hardly to be believed at this distance of years.  What I am certain of is, that I was very far from thinking of writing a  story, though it is possible and even likely that I was thinking of the  man Almayer.    I had seen him for the first time some four years before from the bridge  of a steamer moored to a rickety little wharf forty miles up, more or  less, a Bornean river. It was very early morning and a slight mist, an  opaline mist as in Bessborough Gardens only without the fiery flicks on  roof and chimney-pot from the rays of the red London sun, promised to  turn presently into a woolly fog. Barring a small dug-out canoe on the  river there was nothing moving within sight. I had just come up yawning  from my cabin. The serang and the Malay crew were overhauling the cargo  chains and trying the winches; their voices sounded subdued on the  deck below and their movements were languid. That tropical daybreak was  chilly. The Malay quartermaster, coming up to get something from the  lockers on the bridge, shivered visibly. The forests above and below and  on the opposite bank looked black and dank; wet dripped from the rigging  upon the tightly stretched deck awnings, and it was in the middle of a  shuddering yawn that I caught sight of Almayer. He was moving across a  patch of burnt grass, a blurred shadowy shape with the blurred bulk of  a house behind him, a low house of mats, bamboos and palm-leaves with a  high-pitched roof of grass.    He stepped upon the jetty. He was clad simply in flapping pyjamas of  cretonne pattern (enormous flowers with yellow petals on a disagreeable  blue ground) and a thin cotton singlet with short sleeves. His arms,  bare to the elbow, were crossed on his chest. His black hair looked  as if it had not been cut for a very long time and a curly wisp of it  strayed across his forehead. I had heard of him at Singapore; I had  heard of him on board; I had heard of him early in the morning and late  at night; I had heard of him at tiffin and at dinner; I had heard of  him in a place called Pulo Laut from a half-caste gentleman there, who  described himself as the manager of a coal-mine; which sounded civilised  and progressive till you heard that the mine could not be worked at  present because it was haunted by some particularly atrocious ghosts. I  had heard of him in a place called Dongola, in the Island of Celebes,  when the Rajah of that little-known seaport (you can get no anchorage  there in less than fifteen fathom, which is extremely inconvenient) came  on board in a friendly way with only two attendants, and drank bottle  after bottle of soda-water on the after-skylight with my good friend and  commander, Captain C--. At least I heard his name distinctly pronounced  several times in a lot of talk in Malay language. Oh yes, I heard it  quite distinctly--Almayer, Almayer--and saw Captain C-- smile while the  fat dingy Rajah laughed audibly. To hear a Malay Rajah laugh outright  is a rare experience I can assure you. And I overhead more of Almayer's  name amongst our deck passengers (mostly wandering traders of good  repute) as they sat all over the ship--each man fenced round with  bundles and boxes--on mats, on pillows, on quilts, on billets of wood,  conversing of Island affairs. Upon my word, I heard the mutter of  Almayer's name faintly at midnight, while making my way aft from the  bridge to look at the patent taffrail-log tinkling its quarter-miles in  the great silence of the sea. I don't mean to say that our passengers  dreamed aloud of Almayer, but it is indubitable that two of them at  least, who could not sleep apparently and were trying to charm away the  trouble of insomnia by a little whispered talk at that ghostly hour,  were referring in some way or other to Almayer. It was really impossible  on board that ship to get away definitely from Almayer; and a very small  pony tied up forward and whisking its tail inside the galley, to the  great embarrassment of our Chinaman cook, was destined for Almayer. What  he wanted with a pony goodness only knows, since I am perfectly certain  he could not ride it; but here you have the man, ambitious, aiming at  the grandiose, importing a pony, whereas in the whole settlement at  which he used to shake daily his impotent fist, there was only one path  that was practicable for a pony: a quarter of a mile at most, hedged  in by hundreds of square leagues of virgin forest. But who knows? The  importation of that Bali Pony might have been part of some deep scheme,  of some diplomatic plan, of some hopeful intrigue. With Almayer one  could never tell. He governed his conduct by considerations removed  from the obvious, by incredible assumptions, which rendered his logic  impenetrable to any reasonable person. I learned all this later. That  morning seeing the figure in pyjamas moving in the mist I said to  myself: �That's the man.�    He came quite close to the ship's side and raised a harassed  countenance, round and flat, with that curl of black hair over the  forehead and a heavy, pained glance.    �Good morning.�    �Good morning.�    He looked hard at me: I was a new face, having just replaced the chief  mate he was accustomed to see; and I think that this novelty inspired  him, as things generally did, with deep-seated mistrust.    �Didn't expect you in till this evening,� he remarked suspiciously.    I don't know why he should have been aggrieved, but he seemed to be.  I took pains to explain to him that having picked up the beacon at the  mouth of the river just before dark and the tide serving, Captain C--  was enabled to cross the bar and there was nothing to prevent him going  up river at night.    �Captain C-- knows this river like his own pocket,� I concluded  discursively, trying to get on terms.    �Better,� said Almayer.    Leaning over the rail of the bridge I looked at Almayer, who looked down  at the wharf in aggrieved thought. He shuffled his feet a little; he  wore straw slippers with thick soles. The morning fog had thickened  considerably. Everything round us dripped: the derricks, the rails,  every single rope in the ship--as if a fit of crying had come upon the  universe.    Almayer again raised his head and in the accents of a man accustomed to  the buffets of evil fortune asked hardly audibly:    �I suppose you haven't got such a thing as a pony on board?�    I told him almost in a whisper, for he attuned my communications to his  minor key, that we had such a thing as a pony, and I hinted, as gently  as I could, that he was confoundedly in the way too. I was very anxious  to have him landed before I began to handle the cargo. Almayer remained  looking up at me for a long while with incredulous and melancholy  eyes as though it were not a safe thing to believe my statement. This  pathetic mistrust in the favourable issue of any sort of affair touched  me deeply, and I added:    �He doesn't seem a bit the worse for the passage. He's a nice pony too.�    Almayer was not to be cheered up; for all answer he cleared his throat  and looked down again at his feet. I tried to close with him on another  tack.    �By Jove!� I said. �Aren't you afraid of catching pneumonia or  bronchitis or something, walking about in a singlet in such a wet fog?�    He was not to be propitiated by a show of interest in his health. His  answer was a sinister �No fear,� as much as to say that even that way of  escape from inclement fortune was closed to him.    �I just came down . . .� he mumbled after a while.    �Well then, now you're here I will land that pony for you at once and  you can lead him home. I really don't want him on deck. He's in the  way.�    Almayer seemed doubtful. I insisted:    �Why, I will just swing him out and land him on the wharf right in front  of you. I'd much rather do it before the hatches are off. The little  devil may jump down the hold or do some other deadly thing.�    �There's a halter?� postulated Almayer.    �Yes, of course there's a halter.� And without waiting any more I leaned  over the bridge rail.    �Serang, land Tuan Almayer's pony.�    The cook hastened to shut the door of the galley and a moment later a  great scuffle began on deck. The pony kicked with extreme energy, the  kalashes skipped out of the way, the serang issued many orders in a  cracked voice. Suddenly the pony leaped upon the fore-hatch. His little  hoofs thundered tremendously; he plunged and reared. He had tossed his  mane and his forelock into a state of amazing wildness, he dilated his  nostrils, bits of foam flecked his broad little chest, his eyes blazed.  He was something under eleven hands; he was fierce, terrible, angry,  warlike, he said ha! ha! distinctly, he raged and thumped--and sixteen  able-bodied kalashes stood round him like disconcerted nurses round a  spoilt and passionate child. He whisked his tail incessantly; he arched  his pretty neck; he was perfectly delightful; he was charmingly naughty.  There was not an atom of vice in that performance; no savage baring of  teeth and lying back of ears. On the contrary, he pricked them forward  in a comically aggressive manner. He was totally unmoral and lovable; I  would have liked to give him bread, sugar, carrots. But life is a stern  thing and the sense of duty the only safe guide. So I steeled my heart  and from my elevated position on the bridge I ordered the men to fling  themselves upon him in a body.    The elderly serang, emitting a strange inarticulate cry, gave the  example. He was an excellent petty officer--very competent indeed, and a  moderate opium smoker. The rest of them in one great rush smothered that  pony. They hung on to his ears, to his mane, to his tail; they lay in  piles across his back, seventeen in all. The carpenter, seizing the hook  of the cargo-chain, flung himself on top of them. A very satisfactory  petty officer too, but he stuttered. Have you ever heard a light-yellow,  lean, sad, earnest Chinaman stutter in pidgin-English? It's very weird  indeed. He made the eighteenth. I could not see the pony at all; but  from the swaying and heaving of that heap of men I knew that there was  something alive inside.    From the wharf Almayer hailed in quavering tones:    �Oh, I say!�    Where he stood he could not see what was going on on deck unless perhaps  the tops of the men's heads; he could only hear the scuffle, the mighty  thuds, as if the ship were being knocked to pieces. I looked over: �What  is it?�    �Don't let them break his legs,� he entreated me plaintively.    �Oh, nonsense! He's all right now. He can't move.�    By that time the cargo-chain had been hooked to the broad canvas belt  round the pony's body, the kalashes sprang off simultaneously in all  directions, rolling over each other, and the worthy serang, making a  dash behind the winch, turned the steam on.    �Steady!� I yelled, in great apprehension of seeing the animal snatched  up to the very head of the derrick.    On the wharf Almayer shuffled his straw slippers uneasily. The rattle of  the winch stopped, and in a tense, impressive silence that pony began to  swing across the deck.    How limp he was! Directly he felt himself in the air he relaxed every  muscle in a most wonderful manner. His four hoofs knocked together in a  bunch, his head hung down, and his tail remained pendent in a nerveless  and absolute immobility. He reminded me vividly of the pathetic little  sheep which hangs on the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece. I had  no idea that anything in the shape of a horse could be so limp as that,  either living or dead. His wild mane hung down lumpily, a mere mass of  inanimate horsehair; his aggressive ears had collapsed, but as he went  swaying slowly across the front of the bridge I noticed an astute gleam  in his dreamy, half-closed eye. A trustworthy quartermaster, his glance  anxious and his mouth on the broad grin, was easing over the derrick  watchfully. I superintended, greatly interested.    �So! That will do.�    The derrick-head stopped. The kalashes lined the rail. The rope of the  halter hung perpendicular and motionless like a bell-pull in front of  Almayer. Everything was very still. I suggested amicably that he  should catch hold of the rope and mind what he was about. He extended a  provokingly casual and superior hand.    �Look out then! Lower away!�    Almayer gathered in the rope intelligently enough, but when the pony's  hoofs touched the wharf he gave way all at once to a most foolish  optimism. Without pausing, without thinking, almost without looking, he  disengaged the hook suddenly from the sling, and the cargo-chain, after  hitting the pony's quarters, swung back against the ship's side with  a noisy, rattling slap. I suppose I must have blinked. I know I missed  something, because the next thing I saw was Almayer lying flat on his  back on the jetty. He was alone.    Astonishment deprived me of speech long enough to give Almayer time to  pick himself up in a leisurely and painful manner. The kalashes lining  the rail had all their mouths open. The mist flew in the light breeze,  and it had come over quite thick enough to hide the shore completely.    �How on earth did you manage to let him get away?� I asked scandalised.    Almayer looked into the smarting palm of his right hand, but did not  answer my inquiry.    �Where do you think he will get to?� I cried. �Are there any fences  anywhere in this fog? Can he bolt into the forest? What's to be done  now?�    Almayer shrugged his shoulders.    �Some of my men are sure to be about. They will get hold of him sooner  or later.�    �Sooner or later! That's all very fine, but what about my canvas  sling--he's carried it off. I want it now, at once, to land two Celebes  cows.�    Since Dongola we had on board a pair of the pretty little island cattle  in addition to the pony. Tied up on the other side of the fore deck they  had been whisking their tails into the other door of the galley. These  cows were not for Almayer, however; they were invoiced to Abdullah bin  Selim, his enemy. Almayer's disregard of my requisites was complete.    �If I were you I would try to find out where he's gone,� I insisted.  �Hadn't you better call your men together or something? He will throw  himself down and cut his knees. He may even break a leg, you know.�    But Almayer, plunged in abstracted thought, did not seem to want that  pony any more. Amazed at this sudden indifference I turned all hands out  on shore to hunt for him on my own account, or, at any rate, to hunt  for the canvas sling which he had round his body. The whole crew of  the steamer, with the exception of firemen and engineers, rushed up the  jetty past the thoughtful Almayer and vanished from my sight. The white  fog swallowed them up; and again there was a deep silence that seemed to  extend for miles up and down the stream. Still taciturn, Almayer started  to climb on board, and I went down from the bridge to meet him on the  after deck.    �Would you mind telling the captain that I want to see him very  particularly?� he asked me in a low tone, letting his eyes stray all  over the place.    �Very well. I will go and see.�    With the door of his cabin wide open Captain C--, just back from the  bathroom, big and broad-chested, was brushing his thick, damp, iron-grey  hair with two large brushes.    �Mr. Almayer told me he wanted to see you very particularly, sir.�    Saying these words I smiled. I don't know why I smiled except that it  seemed absolutely impossible to mention Almayer's name without a smile  of a sort. It had not to be necessarily a mirthful smile. Turning his  head towards me Captain C-- smiled too, rather joylessly.    �The pony got away from him--eh?�    �Yes sir. He did.�    �Where is he?�    �Goodness only knows.�    �No. I mean Almayer. Let him come along.�    The captain's stateroom opening straight on deck under the bridge, I had  only to beckon from the doorway to Almayer, who had remained aft, with  downcast eyes, on the very spot where I had left him. He strolled up  moodily, shook hands and at once asked permission to shut the cabin  door.    �I have a pretty story to tell you,� were the last words I heard. The  bitterness of tone was remarkable.    I went away from the door, of course. For the moment I had no crew on  board; only the Chinaman carpenter, with a canvas bag hung round his  neck and a hammer in his hand, roamed about the empty decks knocking  out the wedges of the hatches and dropping them into the bag  conscientiously. Having nothing to do I joined our two engineers at the  door of the engine-room. It was near breakfast time.    �He's turned up early, hasn't he?� commented the second engineer, and  smiled indifferently. He was an abstemious man with a good digestion and  a placid, reasonable view of life even when hungry.    �Yes,� I said. �Shut up with the old man. Some very particular  business.�    �He will spin him a damned endless yarn,� observed the chief engineer.    He smiled rather sourly. He was dyspeptic and suffered from gnawing  hunger in the morning. The second smiled broadly, a smile that made two  vertical folds on his shaven cheeks. And I smiled too, but I was not  exactly amused. In that man, whose name apparently could not be uttered  anywhere in the Malay Archipelago without a smile, there was nothing  amusing whatever. That morning he breakfasted with us silently, looking  mostly into his cup. I informed him that my men came upon his pony  capering in the fog on the very brink of the eight-foot-deep well in  which he kept his store of guttah. The cover was off with no one near  by, and the whole of my crew just missed going heels over head into  that beastly hole. Jurumudi Itam, our best quartermaster, deft at fine  needlework, he who mended the ship's flags and sewed buttons on our  coats, was disabled by a kick on the shoulder.    Both remorse and gratitude seemed foreign to Almayer's character. He  mumbled:    �Do you mean that pirate fellow?�    �What pirate fellow? The man has been in the ship eleven years,� I said  indignantly.    �It's his looks,� Almayer muttered for all apology.    The sun had eaten up the fog. From where we sat under the after awning  we could see in the distance the pony tied up in front of Almayer's  house, to a post of the verandah. We were silent for a long time. All at  once Almayer, alluding evidently to the subject of his conversation in  the captain's cabin, exclaimed anxiously across the table:    �I really don't know what I can do now!�    Captain C-- only raised his eyebrows at him, and got up from his chair.  We dispersed to our duties, but Almayer, half dressed as he was in  his cretonne pyjamas and the thin cotton singlet, remained on board,  lingering near the gangway as though he could not make up his mind  whether to go home or stay with us for good. Our Chinamen boys gave  him side glances as they went to and fro; and Ah Sing, our young chief  steward, the handsomest and most sympathetic of Chinamen, catching my  eye, nodded knowingly at his burly back. In the course of the morning I  approached him for a moment.    �Well, Mr. Almayer,� I addressed him easily, �you haven't started on  your letters yet.�    We had brought him his mail and he had held the bundle in his hand ever  since we got up from breakfast. He glanced at it when I spoke and, for a  moment, it looked as if he were on the point of opening his fingers and  letting the whole lot fall overboard. I believe he was tempted to do so.  I shall never forget that man afraid of his letters.    �Have you been long out from Europe?� he asked me.    �Not very. Not quite eight months,� I told him. �I left a ship in  Samarang with a hurt back and have been in the hospital in Singapore  some weeks.�    He sighed.    �Trade is very bad here.�    �Indeed!�    �Hopeless! . . . See these geese?�    With the hand holding the letters he pointed out to me what resembled  a patch of snow creeping and swaying across the distant part of his  compound. It disappeared behind some bushes.    �The only geese on the East Coast,� Almayer informed me in a perfunctory  mutter without a spark of faith, hope or pride. Thereupon, with the same  absence of any sort of sustaining spirit he declared his intention to  silence a fat bird and send him on board for us not later than next day.    I had heard of these largesses before. He conferred a goose as if it  were a sort of Court decoration given only to the tried friends of the  house. I had expected more pomp in the ceremony. The gift had surely  its special quality, multiple and rare. From the only flock on the East  Coast! He did not make half enough of it. That man did not understand  his opportunities. However, I thanked him at some length.    �You see,� he interrupted abruptly in a very peculiar tone, �the worst  of this country is that one is not able to realise . . . it's impossible  to realise . . .� His voice sank into a languid mutter. �And when one  has very large interests . . . very important interests . . .� he finished  faintly . . . �up the river.�    We looked at each other. He astonished me by giving a start and making a  very queer grimace.    �Well, I must be off,� he burst out hurriedly. �So long!�    At the moment of stepping over the gangway he checked himself though, to  give me a mumbled invitation to dine at his house that evening with my  captain, an invitation which I accepted. I don't think it could have  been possible for me to refuse.    I like the worthy folk who will talk to you of the exercise of free  will �at any rate for practical purposes.� Free, is it? For practical  purposes! Bosh! How could I have refused to dine with that man? I did  not refuse simply because I could not refuse. Curiosity, a healthy  desire for a change of cooking, common civility, the talk and the smiles  of the previous twenty days, every condition of my existence at that  moment and place made irresistibly for acceptance; and, crowning all  that, there was the ignorance, the ignorance, I say, the fatal want  of foreknowledge to counter-balance these imperative conditions of  the problem. A refusal would have appeared perverse and insane. Nobody  unless a surly lunatic would have refused. But if I had not got to know  Almayer pretty well it is almost certain there would never have been a  line of mine in print.    I accepted then--and I am paying yet the price of my sanity. The  possessor of the only flock of geese on the East Coast is responsible  for the existence of some fourteen volumes, so far. The number of  geese he had called into being under adverse climatic conditions was  considerably more than fourteen. The tale of volumes will never overtake  the counting of heads, I am safe to say; but my ambitions point not  exactly that way, and whatever the pangs the toil of writing has cost me  I have always thought kindly of Almayer.    I wonder, had he known anything of it, what his attitude would have  been? This is something not to be discovered in this world. But if we  ever meet in the Elysian Fields--where I cannot depict him to myself  otherwise than attended in the distance by his flock of geese (birds  sacred to Jupiter)--and he addresses me in the stillness of that  passionless region, neither light nor darkness, neither sound nor  silence, and heaving endlessly with billowy mists from the impalpable  multitudes of the swarming dead, I think I know what answer to make.    I would say, after listening courteously to the unvibrating tone of his  measured remonstrances, which should not disturb, of course, the solemn  eternity of stillness in the least--I would say something like this:    �It is true, Almayer, that in the world below I have converted your name  to my own uses. But that is a very small larceny. What's in a name, O  Shade? If so much of your old mortal weakness clings to you yet as  to make you feel aggrieved (it was the note of your earthly voice,  Almayer), then, I entreat you, seek speech without delay with our  sublime fellow-Shade--with him who, in his transient existence as a  poet, commented upon the smell of the rose. He will comfort you. You  came to me stripped of all prestige by men's queer smiles and the  disrespectful chatter of every vagrant trader in the Islands. Your name  was the common property of the winds: it, as it were, floated naked over  the waters about the Equator. I wrapped round its unhonoured form the  royal mantle of the tropics and have essayed to put into the hollow  sound the very anguish of paternity--feats which you did not demand from  me--but remember that all the toil and all the pain were mine. In your  earthly life you haunted me, Almayer. Consider that this was taking a  great liberty. Since you were always complaining of being lost to the  world, you should remember that if I had not believed enough in your  existence to let you haunt my rooms in Bessborough Gardens, you would  have been much more lost. You affirm that had I been capable of looking  at you with a more perfect detachment and a greater simplicity, I might  have perceived better the inward marvellousness which, you insist,  attended your career upon that tiny pin-point of light, hardly visible  far, far below us, where both our graves lie. No doubt! But reflect, O  complaining Shade! that this was not so much my fault as your crowning  misfortune. I believed in you in the only way it was possible for me to  believe. It was not worthy of your merits? So be it. But you were always  an unlucky man, Almayer. Nothing was ever quite worthy of you. What made  you so real to me was that you held this lofty theory with some force of  conviction and with an admirable consistency.�    It is with some such words translated into the proper shadowy  expressions that I am prepared to placate Almayer in the Elysian Abode  of Shades, since it has come to pass that having parted many years ago,  we are never to meet again in this world.        Chapter V.    In the career of the most unliterary of writers, in the sense that  literary ambition had never entered the world of his imagination, the  coming into existence of the first book is quite an inexplicable event.  In my own case I cannot trace it back to any mental or psychological  cause which one could point out and hold to. The greatest of my gifts  being a consummate capacity for doing nothing, I cannot even point to  boredom as a rational stimulus for taking up a pen. The pen at any rate  was there, and there is nothing wonderful in that. Everybody keeps a  pen (the cold steel of our days) in his rooms in this enlightened age of  penny stamps and halfpenny postcards. In fact, this was the epoch when  by means of postcard and pen Mr. Gladstone had made the reputation of  a novel or two. And I too had a pen rolling about somewhere--the  seldom-used, the reluctantly-taken-up pen of a sailor ashore, the pen  rugged with the dried ink of abandoned attempts, of answers delayed  longer than decency permitted, of letters begun with infinite reluctance  and put off suddenly till next day--tell next week as likely as not! The  neglected, uncared-for pen, flung away at the slightest provocation, and  under the stress of dire necessity hunted for without enthusiasm, in a  perfunctory, grumpy worry, in the �Where the devil is the beastly thing  gone to?� ungracious spirit. Where indeed! It might have been reposing  behind the sofa for a day or so. My landlady's anaemic daughter (as  Ollendorff would have expressed it), though commendably neat, had a  lordly, careless manner of approaching her domestic duties. Or it  might even be resting delicately poised on its point by the side of  the table-leg, and when picked up show a gaping, inefficient beak which  would have discouraged any man of literary instincts. But not me! �Never  mind. This will do.�    O days without guile! If anybody had told me then that a devoted  household, having a generally exaggerated idea of my talents and  importance, would be put into a state of tremor and flurry by the fuss  I would make because of a suspicion that somebody had touched my  sacrosanct pen of authorship, I would have never deigned as much as the  contemptuous smile of unbelief. There are imaginings too unlikely for  any kind of notice, too wild for indulgence itself, too absurd for a  smile. Perhaps, had that seer of the future been a friend, I should have  been secretly saddened. �Alas!� I would have thought, looking at him  with an unmoved face, �the poor fellow is going mad.�    I would have been, without doubt, saddened; for in this world where the  journalists read the signs of the sky, and the wind of heaven itself,  blowing where it listeth, does so under the prophetical management of  the Meteorological Office, but where the secret of human hearts cannot  be captured either by prying or praying, it was infinitely more likely  that the sanest of my friends should nurse the germ of incipient madness  than that I should turn into a writer of tales.    To survey with wonder the changes of one's own self is a fascinating  pursuit for idle hours. The field is so wide, the surprises so varied,  the subject so full of unprofitable but curious hints as to the work of  unseen forces, that one does not weary easily of it. I am not speaking  here of megalomaniacs who rest uneasy under the crown of their unbounded  conceit--who really never rest in this world, and when out of it go  on fretting and fuming on the straitened circumstances of their last  habitation, where all men must lie in obscure equality. Neither am I  thinking of those ambitious minds who, always looking forward to some  aim of aggrandisement, can spare no time for a detached, impersonal  glance upon themselves.    And that's a pity. They are unlucky. These two kinds, together with  the much larger band of the totally unimaginative, of those unfortunate  beings in whose empty and unseeing gaze (as a great French writer has  put it) �the whole universe vanishes into blank nothingness,� miss,  perhaps, the true task of us men whose day is short on this earth, the  abode of conflicting opinions. The ethical view of the universe involves  us at last in so many cruel and absurd contradictions, where the last  vestiges of faith, hope, charity, and even of reason itself, seem ready  to perish, that I have come to suspect that the aim of creation cannot  be ethical at all. I would fondly believe that its object is purely  spectacular: a spectacle for awe, love, adoration, or hate, if you  like, but in this view--and in this view alone--never for despair! Those  visions, delicious or poignant, are a moral end in themselves. The rest  is our affair--the laughter, the tears, the tenderness, the indignation,  the high tranquillity of a steeled heart, the detached curiosity of  a subtle mind--that's our affair! And the unwearied self-forgetful  attention to every phase of the living universe reflected in our  consciousness may be our appointed task on this earth. A task in which  fate has perhaps engaged nothing of us except our conscience, gifted  with a voice in order to bear true testimony to the visible wonder, the  haunting terror, the infinite passion and the illimitable serenity; to  the supreme law and the abiding mystery of the sublime spectacle.    Chi lo sa? It may be true. In this view there is room for every religion  except for the inverted creed of impiety, the mask and cloak of arid  despair; for every joy and every sorrow, for every fair dream, for every  charitable hope. The great aim is to remain true to the emotions called  out of the deep encircled by the firmament of stars, whose infinite  numbers and awful distances may move us to laughter or tears (was it the  Walrus or the Carpenter, in the poem, who �wept to see such quantities  of sand�?), or, again, to a properly steeled heart, may matter nothing  at all.    The casual quotation, which had suggested itself out of a poem full of  merit, leads me to remark that in the conception of a purely spectacular  universe, where inspiration of every sort has a rational existence, the  artist of every kind finds a natural place; and amongst them the poet as  the seer par excellence. Even the writer of prose, who in his less noble  and more toilsome task should be a man with the steeled heart, is worthy  of a place, providing he looks on with undimmed eyes and keeps laughter  out of his voice, let who will laugh or cry. Yes! Even he, the prose  artist of fiction, which after all is but truth often dragged out of a  well and clothed in the painted robe of imaged phrases--even he has his  place amongst kings, demagogues, priests, charlatans, dukes, giraffes,  Cabinet Ministers, Fabians, bricklayers, apostles, ants, scientists,  Kaffirs, soldiers, sailors, elephants, lawyers, dandies, microbes and  constellations of a universe whose amazing spectacle is a moral end in  itself.    Here I perceive (speaking without offence) the reader assuming a subtle  expression, as if the cat were out of the bag. I take the novelist's  freedom to observe the reader's mind formulating the exclamation,  �That's it! The fellow talks pro domo.�    Indeed it was not the intention! When I shouldered the bag I was not  aware of the cat inside. But, after all, why not? The fair courtyards of  the House of Art are thronged by many humble retainers. And there is  no retainer so devoted as he who is allowed to sit on the doorstep. The  fellows who have got inside are apt to think too much of themselves.  This last remark, I beg to state, is not malicious within the definition  of the law of libel. It's fair comment on a matter of public interest.  But never mind. Pro domo. So be it. For his house tant que vous voudrez.  And yet in truth I was by no means anxious to justify my existence.  The attempt would have been not only needless and absurd, but almost  inconceivable, in a purely spectacular universe, where no such  disagreeable necessity can possibly arise. It is sufficient for me to  say (and I am saying it at some length in these pages): �J'ai vecu.� I  have existed, obscure amongst the wonders and terrors of my time, as the  Abbe Sieyes, the original utterer of the quoted words, had managed to  exist through the violences, the crimes, and the enthusiasms of the  French Revolution. �J'ai vecu�, as I apprehend most of us manage  to exist, missing all along the varied forms of destruction by a  hair's-breadth, saving my body, that's clear, and perhaps my soul  also, but not without some damage here and there to the fine edge of my  conscience, that heirloom of the ages, of the race, of the group, of the  family, colourable and plastic, fashioned by the words, the looks,  the acts, and even by the silences and abstentions surrounding one's  childhood; tinged in a complete scheme of delicate shades  and crude colours by the inherited traditions, beliefs, or  prejudices--unaccountable, despotic, persuasive, and often, in its  texture, romantic.    And often romantic! . . . The matter in hand, however, is to keep these  reminiscences from turning into confessions, a form of literary  activity discredited by Jean Jacques Rousseau on account of the extreme  thoroughness he brought to the work of justifying his own existence;  for that such was his purpose is palpably, even grossly, visible to  an unprejudiced eye. But then, you see, the man was not a writer of  fiction. He was an artless moralist, as is clearly demonstrated by his  anniversaries being celebrated with marked emphasis by the heirs of  the French Revolution, which was not a political movement at all, but  a great outburst of morality. He had no imagination, as the most casual  perusal of �Emile� will prove. He was no novelist, whose first virtue is  the exact understanding of the limits traced by the reality of his time  to the play of his invention. Inspiration comes from the earth, which  has a past, a history, a future, not from the cold and immutable heaven.  A writer of imaginative prose (even more than any other sort of artist)  stands confessed in his works. His conscience, his deeper sense of  things, lawful and unlawful, gives him his attitude before the world.  Indeed, every one who puts pen to paper for the reading of strangers  (unless a moralist, who, generally speaking, has no conscience except  the one he is at pains to produce for the use of others) can speak of  nothing else. It is M. Anatole France, the most eloquent and just of  French prose writers, who says that we must recognise at last that,  �failing the resolution to hold our peace, we can only talk of  ourselves.�    This remark, if I remember rightly, was made in the course of a sparring  match with the late Ferdinand Brunetiere over the principles and rules  of literary criticism. As was fitting for a man to whom we owe the  memorable saying, �The good critic is he who relates the adventures of  his soul amongst masterpieces,� M. Anatole France maintained that there  were no rules and no principles. And that may be very true. Rules,  principles and standards die and vanish every day. Perhaps they are all  dead and vanished by this time. These, if ever, are the brave, free days  of destroyed landmarks, while the ingenious minds are busy inventing the  forms of the new beacons which, it is consoling to think, will be set up  presently in the old places. But what is interesting to a writer is the  possession of an inward certitude that literary criticism will never  die, for man (so variously defined) is, before everything else, a  critical animal. And, as long as distinguished minds are ready to treat  it in the spirit of high adventure, literary criticism shall appeal  to us with all the charm and wisdom of a well-told tale of personal  experience.    For Englishmen especially, of all the races of the earth, a task, any  task, undertaken in an adventurous spirit acquires the merit of romance.  But the critics as a rule exhibit but little of an adventurous spirit.  They take risks, of course--one can hardly live without that. The daily  bread is served out to us (however sparingly) with a pinch of salt.  Otherwise one would get sick of the diet one prays for, and that would  be not only improper, but impious. From impiety of that or any other  kind--save us! An ideal of reserved manner, adhered to from a sense  of proprieties, from shyness, perhaps, or caution, or simply from  weariness, induces, I suspect, some writers of criticism to conceal the  adventurous side of their calling, and then the criticism becomes a mere  �notice,� as it were the relation of a journey where nothing but the  distances and the geology of a new country should be set down; the  glimpses of strange beasts, the dangers of flood and field, the  hair's-breadth escapes, and the sufferings (oh, the sufferings too! I  have no doubt of the sufferings) of the traveller being carefully kept  out; no shady spot, no fruitful plant being ever mentioned either; so  that the whole performance looks like a mere feat of agility on the  part of a trained pen running in a desert. A cruel spectacle--a most  deplorable adventure. �Life,� in the words of an immortal thinker of,  I should say, bucolic origin, but whose perishable name is lost to the  worship of posterity--�life is not all beer and skittles.� Neither  is the writing of novels. It isn't really. Je vous donne ma parole  d'honneur that it--is--not. Not all. I am thus emphatic because some  years ago, I remember, the daughter of a general. . .    Sudden revelations of the profane world must have come now and then  to hermits in their cells, to the cloistered monks of Middle Ages, to  lonely sages, men of science, reformers; the revelations of the world's  superficial judgment, shocking to the souls concentrated upon their  own bitter labour in the cause of sanctity, or of knowledge, or of  temperance, let us say, or of art, if only the art of cracking jokes  or playing the flute. And thus this general's daughter came to me--or I  should say one of the general's daughters did. There were three of  these bachelor ladies, of nicely graduated ages, who held a neighbouring  farmhouse in a united and more or less military occupation. The eldest  warred against the decay of manners in the village children, and  executed frontal attacks upon the village mothers for the conquest of  curtseys. It sounds futile, but it was really a war for an idea. The  second skirmished and scouted all over the country; and it was that one  who pushed a reconnaissance right to my very table--I mean the one who  wore stand-up collars. She was really calling upon my wife in the  soft spirit of afternoon friendliness, but with her usual martial  determination. She marched into my room swinging her stick . . . but  no--I mustn't exaggerate. It is not my speciality. I am not a humoristic  writer. In all soberness, then, all I am certain of is that she had a  stick to swing.    No ditch or wall encompassed my abode. The window was open; the door too  stood open to that best friend of my work, the warm, still sunshine of  the wide fields. They lay around me infinitely helpful, but truth to  say I had not known for weeks whether the sun shone upon the earth and  whether the stars above still moved on their appointed courses. I was  just then giving up some days of my allotted span to the last chapters  of the novel �Nostromo,� a tale of an imaginary (but true) seaboard,  which is still mentioned now and again, and indeed kindly, sometimes in  connection with the word �failure� and sometimes in conjunction with the  word �astonishing.� I have no opinion on this discrepancy. It's the sort  of difference that can never be settled. All I know is that, for twenty  months, neglecting the common joys of life that fall to the lot of the  humblest on this earth, I had, like the prophet of old, �wrestled with  the Lord� for my creation, for the headlands of the coast, for the  darkness of the Placid Gulf, the light on the snows, the clouds on the  sky, and for the breath of life that had to be blown into the shapes  of men and women, of Latin and Saxon, of Jew and Gentile. These are,  perhaps, strong words, but it is difficult to characterise otherwise the  intimacy and the strain of a creative effort in which mind and will and  conscience are engaged to the full, hour after hour, day after day,  away from the world, and to the exclusion of all that makes life really  lovable and gentle--something for which a material parallel can only be  found in the everlasting sombre stress of the westward winter passage  round Cape Horn. For that too is the wrestling of men with the might  of their Creator, in a great isolation from the world, without the  amenities and consolations of life, a lonely struggle under a sense of  over-matched littleness, for no reward that could be adequate, but for  the mere winning of a longitude. Yet a certain longitude, once won,  cannot be disputed. The sun and the stars and the shape of your earth  are the witnesses of your gain; whereas a handful of pages, no matter  how much you have made them your own, are at best but an obscure and  questionable spoil. Here they are. �Failure�--�Astonishing�: take your  choice; or perhaps both, or neither--a mere rustle and flutter of pieces  of paper settling down in the night, and undistinguishable, like the  snowflakes of a great drift destined to melt away in the sunshine.    �How do you do?�    It was the greeting of the general's daughter. I had heard nothing--no  rustle, no footsteps. I had felt only a moment before a sort of  premonition of evil; I had the sense of an inauspicious presence--just  that much warning and no more; and then came the sound of the voice and  the jar as of a terrible fall from a great height--a fall, let us say,  from the highest of the clouds floating in gentle procession over the  fields in the faint westerly air of that July afternoon. I picked myself  up quickly, of course; in other words, I jumped up from my chair stunned  and dazed, every nerve quivering with the pain of being uprooted out of  one world and flung down into another--perfectly civil.    �Oh! How do you do? Won't you sit down?�    That's what I said. This horrible but, I assure you, perfectly true  reminiscence tells you more than a whole volume of confessions a la  Jean Jacques Rousseau would do. Observe! I didn't howl at her, or start  upsetting furniture, or throw myself on the floor and kick, or allow  myself to hint in any other way at the appalling magnitude of the  disaster. The whole world of Costaguana (the country, you may remember,  of my seaboard tale), men, women, headlands, houses, mountains, town,  campo (there was not a single brick, stone, or grain of sand of its  soil I had not placed in position with my own hands); all the history,  geography, politics, finance; the wealth of Charles Gould's silver-mine,  and the splendour of the magnificent Capataz de Cargadores, whose name,  cried out in the night (Dr. Monygham heard it pass over his head--in  Linda Viola's voice), dominated even after death the dark gulf  containing his conquests of treasure and love--all that had come down  crashing about my ears. I felt I could never pick up the pieces--and in  that very moment I was saying, �Won't you sit down?�    The sea is strong medicine. Behold what the quarter-deck training even  in a merchant ship will do! This episode should give you a new view of  the English and Scots seamen (a much-caricatured folk) who had the last  say in the formation of my character. One is nothing if not modest,  but in this disaster I think I have done some honour to their simple  teaching. �Won't you sit down?� Very fair; very fair indeed. She sat  down. Her amused glance strayed all over the room. There were pages of  MS. on the table and under the table, a batch of typed copy on a chair,  single leaves had fluttered away into distant corners; there were there  living pages, pages scored and wounded, dead pages that would be burnt  at the end of the day--the litter of a cruel battlefield, of a long,  long and desperate fray. Long! I suppose I went to bed sometimes, and  got up the same number of times. Yes, I suppose I slept, and ate the  food put before me, and talked connectedly to my household on suitable  occasions. But I had never been aware of the even flow of daily  life, made easy and noiseless for me by a silent, watchful, tireless  affection. Indeed, it seemed to me that I had been sitting at that table  surrounded by the litter of a desperate fray for days and nights on  end. It seemed so, because of the intense weariness of which that  interruption had made me aware--the awful disenchantment of a mind  realising suddenly the futility of an enormous task, joined to a bodily  fatigue such as no ordinary amount of fairly heavy physical labour could  ever account for. I have carried bags of wheat on my back, bent almost  double under a ship's deck-beams, from six in the morning till six in  the evening (with an hour and a half off for meals), so I ought to know.    And I love letters. I am jealous of their honour and concerned for the  dignity and comeliness of their service. I was, most likely, the only  writer that neat lady had ever caught in the exercise of his craft, and  it distressed me not to be able to remember when it was that I dressed  myself last, and how. No doubt that would be all right in essentials.  The fortune of the house included a pair of grey-blue watchful eyes that  would see to that. But I felt somehow as grimy as a Costaguana lepero  after a day's fighting in the streets, rumpled all over and dishevelled  down to my very heels. And I am afraid I blinked stupidly. All this was  bad for the honour of letters and the dignity of their service. Seen  indistinctly through the dust of my collapsed universe, the good lady  glanced about the room with a slightly amused serenity. And she was  smiling. What on earth was she smiling at? She remarked casually:    �I am afraid I interrupted you.�    �Not at all.�    She accepted the denial in perfect good faith. And it was strictly true.  Interrupted--indeed! She had robbed me of at least twenty lives, each  infinitely more poignant and real than her own, because informed with  passion, possessed of convictions, involved in great affairs created out  of my own substance for an anxiously meditated end.    She remained silent for a while, then said with a last glance all round  at the litter of the fray:    �And you sit like this here writing your--your . . .�    �I--what? Oh, yes, I sit here all day.�    �It must be perfectly delightful.�    I suppose that, being no longer very young, I might have been on the  verge of having a stroke; but she had left her dog in the porch, and my  boy's dog, patrolling the field in front, had espied him from afar.  He came on straight and swift like a cannon-ball, and the noise of the  fight, which burst suddenly upon our ears, was more than enough to scare  away a fit of apoplexy. We went out hastily and separated the gallant  animals. Afterwards I told the lady where she would find my wife--just  round the corner, under the trees. She nodded and went off with her dog,  leaving me appalled before the death and devastation she had lightly  made--and with the awfully instructive sound of the word �delightful�   lingering in my ears.    Nevertheless, later on, I duly escorted her to the field gate. I wanted  to be civil, of course (what are twenty lives in a mere novel that one  should be rude to a lady on their account?), but mainly, to adopt the  good sound Ollendorffian style, because I did not want the dog of the  general's daughter to fight again (encore) with the faithful dog of  my infant son (mon petit garcon).--Was I afraid that the dog of the  general's daughter would be able to overcome (vaincre) the dog of my  child?--No, I was not afraid. . . . But away with the Ollendorff method.  However appropriate and seemingly unavoidable when I touch upon anything  appertaining to the lady, it is most unsuitable to the origin, character  and history of the dog; for the dog was the gift to the child from a  man for whom words had anything but an Ollendorffian value, a man almost  childlike in the impulsive movements of his untutored genius, the  most single-minded of verbal impressionists, using his great gifts of  straight feeling and right expression with a fine sincerity and a strong  if, perhaps, not fully conscious conviction. His art did not obtain,  I fear, all the credit its unsophisticated inspiration deserved. I am  alluding to the late Stephen Crane, the author of �The Red Badge  of Courage,� a work of imagination which found its short moment of  celebrity in the last decade of the departed century. Other books  followed. Not many. He had not the time. It was an individual and  complete talent, which obtained but a grudging, somewhat supercilious  recognition from the world at large. For himself one hesitates to regret  his early death. Like one of the men in his �Open Boat,� one felt that  he was of those whom fate seldom allows to make a safe landing after  much toil and bitterness at the oar. I confess to an abiding affection  for that energetic, slight, fragile, intensely living and transient  figure. He liked me even before we met on the strength of a page or  two of my writing, and after we had met I am glad to think he liked me  still. He used to point out to me with great earnestness, and even with  some severity, that �a boy ought to have a dog.� I suspect that he  was shocked at my neglect of parental duties. Ultimately it was he who  provided the dog. Shortly afterwards, one day, after playing with the  child on the rug for an hour or so with the most intense absorption, he  raised his head and declared firmly: �I shall teach your boy to ride.�   That was not to be. He was not given the time.    But here is the dog--an old dog now. Broad and low on his bandy paws,  with a black head on a white body and a ridiculous black spot at  the other end of him, he provokes, when he walks abroad, smiles  not altogether unkind. Grotesque and engaging in the whole of his  appearance, his usual attitudes are meek, but his temperament discloses  itself unexpectedly pugnacious in the presence of his kind. As he lies  in the firelight, his head well up, and a fixed, far-away gaze directed  at the shadows of the room, he achieves a striking nobility of pose in  the calm consciousness of an unstained life. He has brought up one baby,  and now, after seeing his first charge off to school, he is bringing up  another with the same conscientious devotion, but with a more deliberate  gravity of manner, the sign of greater wisdom and riper experience,  but also of rheumatism, I fear. From the morning bath to the evening  ceremonies of the cot you attend, old friend, the little two-legged  creature of your adoption, being yourself treated in the exercise of  your duties with every possible regard, with infinite consideration, by  every person in the house--even as I myself am treated; only you  deserve it more. The general's daughter would tell you that it must be  �perfectly delightful.�    Aha! old dog. She never heard you yelp with acute pain (it's that poor  left ear) the while, with incredible self-command, you preserve a rigid  immobility for fear of overturning the little two-legged creature. She  has never seen your resigned smile when the little two-legged creature,  interrogated sternly, �What are you doing to the good dog?� answers with  a wide, innocent stare: �Nothing. Only loving him, mamma dear!�    The general's daughter does not know the secret terms of self-imposed  tasks, good dog, the pain that may lurk in the very rewards of rigid  self-command. But we have lived together many years. We have grown  older, too; and though our work is not quite done yet we may indulge now  and then in a little introspection before the fire--meditate on the art  of bringing up babies and on the perfect delight of writing tales where  so many lives come and go at the cost of one which slips imperceptibly  away.      Chapter VI.    In the retrospect of a life which had, besides its preliminary stage  of childhood and early youth, two distinct developments, and even two  distinct elements, such as earth and water, for its successive scenes,  a certain amount of naiveness is unavoidable. I am conscious of it in  these pages. This remark is put forward in no apologetic spirit. As  years go by and the number of pages grows steadily, the feeling grows  upon one too that one can write only for friends. Then why should one  put them to the necessity of protesting (as a friend would do) that no  apology is necessary, or put, perchance, into their heads the doubt of  one's discretion? So much as to the care due to those friends whom a  word here, a line there, a fortunate page of just feeling in the right  place, some happy simplicity, or even some lucky subtlety, has drawn  from the great multitude of fellow-beings even as a fish is drawn from  the depths of the sea. Fishing is notoriously (I am talking now of the  deep sea) a matter of luck. As to one's enemies, those will take care of  themselves.    There is a gentleman, for instance, who, metaphorically speaking, jumps  upon me with both feet. This image has no grace, but it is exceedingly  apt to the occasion--to the several occasions. I don't know precisely  how long he had been indulging in that intermittent exercise, whose  seasons are ruled by the custom of the publishing trade. Somebody  pointed him out (in printed shape, of course) to my attention some time  ago, and straightway I experienced a sort of reluctant affection for  that robust man. He leaves not a shred of my substance untrodden: for  the writer's substance is his writing; the rest of him is but a vain  shadow, cherished or hated on uncritical grounds. Not a shred! Yet the  sentiment owned to is not a freak of affectation or perversity. It has  a deeper, and, I venture to think, a more estimable origin than the  caprice of emotional lawlessness. It is, indeed, lawful, in so much  that it is given (reluctantly) for a consideration, for several  considerations. There is that robustness, for instance, so often the  sign of good moral balance. That's a consideration. It is not, indeed,  pleasant to be stamped upon, but the very thoroughness of the operation,  implying not only a careful reading, but some real insight into work  whose qualities and defects, whatever they may be, are not so much on  the surface, is something to be thankful for in view of the fact that it  may happen to one's work to be condemned without being read at all. This  is the most fatuous adventure that can well happen to a writer venturing  his soul amongst criticisms. It can do one no harm, of course, but it  is disagreeable. It is disagreeable in the same way as discovering  a three-card-trick man amongst a decent lot of folk in a third-class  compartment. The open impudence of the whole transaction, appealing  insidiously to the folly and credulity of mankind, the brazen, shameless  patter, proclaiming the fraud openly while insisting on the fairness of  the game, give one a feeling of sickening disgust. The honest violence  of a plain man playing a fair game fairly--even if he means to knock you  over--may appear shocking, but it remains within the pale of decency.  Damaging as it may be, it is in no sense offensive. One may well feel  some regard for honesty, even if practised upon one's own vile body.  But it is very obvious that an enemy of that sort will not be stayed  by explanations or placated by apologies. Were I to advance the plea of  youth in excuse of the naiveness to be found in these pages, he would  be likely to say �Bosh!� in a column and a half of fierce print. Yet a  writer is no older than his first published book, and, notwithstanding  the vain appearances of decay which attend us in this transitory life, I  stand here with the wreath of only fifteen short summers on my brow.    With the remark, then, that at such tender age some naiveness of feeling  and expression is excusable, I proceed to admit that, upon the whole,  my previous state of existence was not a good equipment for a literary  life. Perhaps I should not have used the word literary. That word  presupposes an intimacy of acquaintance with letters, a turn of mind and  a manner of feeling to which I dare lay no claim. I only love letters;  but the love of letters does not make a literary man, any more than the  love of the sea makes a seaman. And it is very possible, too, that I  love the letters in the same way a literary man may love the sea  he looks at from the shore--a scene of great endeavour and of great  achievements changing the face of the world, the great open way to all  sorts of undiscovered countries. No, perhaps I had better say that the  life at sea--and I don't mean a mere taste of it, but a good broad span  of years, something that really counts as real service--is not, upon the  whole, a good equipment for a writing life. God forbid, though, that I  should be thought of as denying my masters of the quarter-deck. I am not  capable of that sort of apostasy. I have confessed my attitude of piety  towards their shades in three or four tales, and if any man on earth  more than another needs to be true to himself as he hopes to be saved,  it is certainly the writer of fiction.    What I meant to say, simply, is that the quarter-deck training does not  prepare one sufficiently for the reception of literary criticism. Only  that, and no more. But this defect is not without gravity. If it be  permissible to twist, invert, adapt (and spoil) M. Anatole France's  definition of a good critic, then let us say that the good author is he  who contemplates without marked joy or excessive sorrow the adventures  of his soul amongst criticisms. Far be from me the intention to mislead  an attentive public into the belief that there is no criticism at sea.  That would be dishonest, and even impolite. Everything can be found  at sea, according to the spirit of your quest--strife, peace, romance,  naturalism of the most pronounced kind, ideals, boredom, disgust,  inspiration--and every conceivable opportunity, including the  opportunity to make a fool of yourself--exactly as in the pursuit of  literature. But the quarter-deck criticism is somewhat different from  literary criticism. This much they have in common, that before the one  and the other the answering back, as a general rule, does not pay.    Yes, you find criticism at sea, and even appreciation--I tell you  everything is to be found on salt water--criticism generally impromptu,  and always viva voce, which is the outward, obvious difference from the  literary operation of that kind, with consequent freshness and vigour  which may be lacking in the printed word. With appreciation, which comes  at the end, when the critic and the criticised are about to part, it  is otherwise. The sea appreciation of one's humble talents has the  permanency of the written word, seldom the charm of variety, is formal  in its phrasing. There the literary master has the superiority, though  he, too, can in effect but say--and often says it in the very phrase--�I  can highly recommend.� Only usually he uses the word �We,� there being  some occult virtue in the first person plural, which makes it specially  fit for critical and royal declarations. I have a small handful of these  sea appreciations, signed by various masters, yellowing slowly in my  writing-table's left-hand drawer, rustling under my reverent touch, like  a handful of dry leaves plucked for a tender memento from the tree of  knowledge. Strange! It seems that it is for these few bits of paper,  headed by the names of a few ships and signed by the names of a  few Scots and English shipmasters, that I have faced the astonished  indignations, the mockeries and the reproaches of a sort hard to  bear for a boy of fifteen; that I have been charged with the want of  patriotism, the want of sense, and the want of heart too; that I went  through agonies of self-conflict and shed secret tears not a few, and  had the beauties of the Furca Pass spoiled for me, and have been called  an �incorrigible Don Quixote,� in allusion to the book-born madness of  the knight. For that spoil! They rustle, those bits of paper--some dozen  of them in all. In that faint, ghostly sound there live the memories of  twenty years, the voices of rough men now no more, the strong voice of  the everlasting winds, and the whisper of a mysterious spell, the murmur  of the great sea, which must have somehow reached my inland cradle and  entered my unconscious ear, like that formula of Mohammedan faith the  Mussulman father whispers into the ear of his new-born infant, making  him one of the faithful almost with his first breath. I do not know  whether I have been a good seaman, but I know I have been a very  faithful one. And after all there is that handful of �characters� from  various ships to prove that all these years have not been altogether a  dream. There they are, brief, and monotonous in tone, but as suggestive  bits of writing to me as any inspired page to be found in literature.  But then, you see, I have been called romantic. Well, that can't be  helped. But stay. I seem to remember that I have been called a realist  also. And as that charge too can be made out, let us try to live up  to it, at whatever cost, for a change. With this end in view, I will  confide to you coyly, and only because there is no one about to see my  blushes by the light of the midnight lamp, that these suggestive bits  of quarter-deck appreciation one and all contain the words �strictly  sober.�    Did I overhear a civil murmur, �That's very gratifying, to be sure�?  Well, yes, it is gratifying--thank you. It is at least as gratifying to  be certified sober as to be certified romantic, though such certificates  would not qualify one for the secretaryship of a temperance association  or for the post of official troubadour to some lordly democratic  institution such as the London County Council, for instance. The above  prosaic reflection is put down here only in order to prove the general  sobriety of my judgment in mundane affairs. I make a point of it because  a couple of years ago, a certain short story of mine being published in  a French translation, a Parisian critic--I am almost certain it was M.  Gustave Kahn in the �Gil-Blas�--giving me a short notice, summed up  his rapid impression of the writer's quality in the words un puissant  reveur. So be it! Who would cavil at the words of a friendly reader? Yet  perhaps not such an unconditional dreamer as all that. I will make bold  to say that neither at sea nor ashore have I ever lost the sense of  responsibility. There is more than one sort of intoxication. Even before  the most seductive reveries I have remained mindful of that sobriety of  interior life, that asceticism of sentiment, in which alone the naked  form of truth, such as one conceives it, such as one feels it, can be  rendered without shame. It is but a maudlin and indecent verity that  comes out through the strength of wine. I have tried to be a sober  worker all my life--all my two lives. I did so from taste, no doubt,  having an instinctive horror of losing my sense of full self-possession,  but also from artistic conviction. Yet there are so many pitfalls on  each side of the true path that, having gone some way, and feeling a  little battered and weary, as a middle-aged traveller will from the  mere daily difficulties of the march, I ask myself whether I have kept  always, always faithful to that sobriety wherein there is power, and  truth, and peace.    As to my sea-sobriety, that is quite properly certified under the  sign-manual of several trustworthy shipmasters of some standing in their  time. I seem to hear your polite murmur that �Surely this might have  been taken for granted.� Well, no. It might not have been. That august  academical body the Marine Department of the Board of Trade takes  nothing for granted in the granting of its learned degrees. By its  regulations issued under the first Merchant Shipping Act, the very word  _sober_ must be written, or a whole sackful, a ton, a mountain of the  most enthusiastic appreciation will avail you nothing. The door of the  examination rooms shall remain closed to your tears and entreaties.  The most fanatical advocate of temperance could not be more pitilessly  fierce in his rectitude than the Marine Department of the Board of  Trade. As I have been face to face at various times with all the  examiners of the Port of London, in my generation, there can be no doubt  as to the force and the continuity of my abstemiousness. Three of them  were examiners in seamanship, and it was my fate to be delivered into  the hands of each of them at proper intervals of sea service. The first  of all, tall, spare, with a perfectly white head and moustache, a quiet,  kindly manner, and an air of benign intelligence, must, I am forced  to conclude, have been unfavourably impressed by something in my  appearance. His old thin hands loosely clasped resting on his crossed  legs, he began by an elementary question in a mild voice, and went on,  went on. . . . It lasted for hours, for hours. Had I been a strange  microbe with potentialities of deadly mischief to the Merchant Service I  could not have been submitted to a more microscopic examination. Greatly  reassured by his apparent benevolence, I had been at first very alert in  my answers. But at length the feeling of my brain getting addled crept  upon me. And still the passionless process went on, with a sense of  untold ages having been spent already on mere preliminaries. Then I got  frightened. I was not frightened of being plucked; that eventuality did  not even present itself to my mind. It was something much more serious,  and weird. �This ancient person,� I said to myself, terrified, �is so  near his grave that he must have lost all notion of time. He is  considering this examination in terms of eternity. It is all very well  for him. His race is run. But I may find myself coming out of this room  into the world of men a stranger, friendless, forgotten by my very  landlady, even were I able after this endless experience to remember the  way to my hired home.� This statement is not so much of a verbal  exaggeration as may be supposed. Some very queer thoughts passed through  my head while I was considering my answers; thoughts which had nothing  to do with seamanship, nor yet with anything reasonable known to this  earth. I verily believe that at times I was lightheaded in a sort of  languid way. At last there fell a silence, and that, too, seemed to last  for ages, while, bending over his desk, the examiner wrote out my  pass-slip slowly with a noiseless pen. He extended the scrap of paper  to me without a word, inclined his white head gravely to my parting  bow. . . .    When I got out of the room I felt limply flat, like a squeezed lemon,  and the door-keeper in his glass cage, where I stopped to get my hat and  tip him a shilling, said:    �Well! I thought you were never coming out.�    �How long have I been in there?� I asked faintly.    He pulled out his watch.    �He kept you, sir, just under three hours. I don't think this ever  happened with any of the gentlemen before.�    It was only when I got out of the building that I began to walk on  air. And the human animal being averse from change and timid before the  unknown, I said to myself that I would not mind really being examined  by the same man on a future occasion. But when the time of ordeal  came round again the doorkeeper let me into another room, with the  now familiar paraphernalia of models of ships and tackle, a board for  signals on the wall, a big long table covered with official forms,  and having an unrigged mast fixed to the edge. The solitary tenant  was unknown to me by sight, though not by reputation, which was simply  execrable. Short and sturdy as far as I could judge, clad in an old,  brown, morning-suit, he sat leaning on his elbow, his hand shading his  eyes, and half averted from the chair I was to occupy on the other side  of the table. He was motionless, mysterious, remote, enigmatical, with  something mournful too in the pose, like that statue of Giuliano (I  think) de' Medici shading his face on the tomb by Michael Angelo,  though, of course, he was far, far from being beautiful. He began by  trying to make me talk nonsense. But I had been warned of that fiendish  trait, and contradicted him with great assurance. After a while he left  off. So far good. But his immobility, the thick elbow on the table, the  abrupt, unhappy voice, the shaded and averted face grew more and more  impressive. He kept inscrutably silent for a moment, and then, placing  me in a ship of a certain size, at sea, under certain conditions of  weather, season, locality, &amp;c. &amp;c.--all very clear and precise--ordered  me to execute a certain manoeuvre. Before I was half through with it he  did some material damage to the ship. Directly I had grappled with the  difficulty he caused another to present itself, and when that too  was met he stuck another ship before me, creating a very dangerous  situation. I felt slightly outraged by this ingenuity in piling up  trouble upon a man.    �I wouldn't have got into that mess,� I suggested mildly. �I could have  seen that ship before.�    He never stirred the least bit.    �No, you couldn't. The weather's thick.�    �Oh! I didn't know,� I apologised blankly.    I suppose that after all I managed to stave off the smash with  sufficient approach to verisimilitude, and the ghastly business went on.  You must understand that the scheme of the test he was applying to me  was, I gathered, a homeward passage--the sort of passage I would not  wish to my bitterest enemy. That imaginary ship seemed to labour under  a most comprehensive curse. It's no use enlarging on these never-ending  misfortunes; suffice it to say that long before the end I would have  welcomed with gratitude an opportunity to exchange into the �Flying  Dutchman.� Finally he shoved me into the North Sea (I suppose) and  provided me with a lee-shore with outlying sandbanks--the Dutch coast  presumably. Distance, eight miles. The evidence of such implacable  animosity deprived me of speech for quite half a minute.    �Well,� he said--for our pace had been very smart indeed till then.    �I will have to think a little, sir.�    �Doesn't look as if there were much time to think,� he muttered  sardonically from under his hand.    �No, sir,� I said with some warmth. �Not on board a ship I could see.  But so many accidents have happened that I really can't remember what  there's left for me to work with.�    Still half averted, and with his eyes concealed, he made unexpectedly a  grunting remark.    �You've done very well.�    �Have I the two anchors at the bow, sir?� I asked.    �Yes.�    I prepared myself then, as a last hope for the ship, to let them both  go in the most effectual manner, when his infernal system of testing  resourcefulness came into play again.    �But there's only one cable. You've lost the other.�    It was exasperating.    �Then I would back them, if I could, and tail the heaviest hawser on  board on the end of the chain before letting go, and if she parted from  that, which is quite likely, I would just do nothing. She would have to  go.�    �Nothing more to do, eh?�    �No, sir. I could do no more.�    He gave a bitter half-laugh.    �You could always say your prayers.�    He got up, stretched himself, and yawned slightly. It was a sallow,  strong, unamiable face. He put me in a surly, bored fashion through the  usual questions as to lights and signals, and I escaped from the room  thankfully--passed! Forty minutes! And again I walked on air along Tower  Hill, where so many good men had lost their heads, because, I suppose,  they were not resourceful enough to save them. And in my heart of hearts  I had no objection to meeting that examiner once more when the third and  last ordeal became due in another year or so. I even hoped I should.  I knew the worst of him now, and forty minutes is not an unreasonable  time. Yes, I distinctly hoped. . .    But not a bit of it. When I presented myself to be examined for Master  the examiner who received me was short, plump, with a round, soft face  in grey, fluffy whiskers, and fresh, loquacious lips.    He commenced operations with an easy-going �Let's see. H'm. Suppose you  tell me all you know of charter-parties.� He kept it up in that style  all through, wandering off in the shape of comment into bits out of his  own life, then pulling himself up short and returning to the business in  hand. It was very interesting. �What's your idea of a jury-rudder now?�   he queried suddenly, at the end of an instructive anecdote bearing upon  a point of stowage.    I warned him that I had no experience of a lost rudder at sea, and gave  him two classical examples of makeshifts out of a text-book. In exchange  he described to me a jury-rudder he had invented himself years before,  when in command of a 3000-ton steamer. It was, I declare, the cleverest  contrivance imaginable. �May be of use to you some day,� he concluded.  �You will go into steam presently. Everybody goes into steam.�    There he was wrong. I never went into steam--not really. If I only live  long enough I shall become a bizarre relic of a dead barbarism, a sort  of monstrous antiquity, the only seaman of the dark ages who had never  gone into steam--not really.    Before the examination was over he imparted to me a few interesting  details of the transport service in the time of the Crimean War.    �The use of wire rigging became general about that time too,� he  observed. �I was a very young master then. That was before you were  born.�    �Yes, sir. I am of the year 1857.�    �The Mutiny year,� he commented, as if to himself, adding in a louder  tone that his ship happened then to be in the Gulf of Bengal, employed  under a Government charter.    Clearly the transport service had been the making of this examiner, who  so unexpectedly had given me an insight into his existence, awakening in  me the sense of the continuity of that sea-life into which I had stepped  from outside; giving a touch of human intimacy to the machinery of  official relations. I felt adopted. His experience was for me, too, as  though he had been an ancestor.    Writing my long name (it has twelve letters) with laborious care on the  slip of blue paper, he remarked:    �You are of Polish extraction.�    �Born there, sir.�    He laid down the pen and leaned back to look at me as it were for the  first time.    �Not many of your nationality in our service, I should think. I never  remember meeting one either before or after I left the sea. Don't  remember ever hearing of one. An inland people, aren't you?�    I said yes--very much so. We were remote from the sea not only by  situation, but also from a complete absence of indirect association, not  being a commercial nation at all, but purely agricultural. He made then  the quaint reflection that it was �a long way for me to come out to  begin a sea-life�; as if sea-life were not precisely a life in which one  goes a long way from home.    I told him, smiling, that no doubt I could have found a ship much nearer  my native place, but I had thought to myself that if I was to be a  seaman then I would be a British seaman and no other. It was a matter of  deliberate choice.    He nodded slightly at that; and as he kept on looking at me  interrogatively, I enlarged a little, confessing that I had spent a  little time on the way in the Mediterranean and in the West Indies. I  did not want to present myself to the British Merchant Service in an  altogether green state. It was no use telling him that my mysterious  vocation was so strong that my very wild oats had to be sown at sea.  It was the exact truth, but he would not have understood the somewhat  exceptional psychology of my sea-going, I fear.    �I suppose you've never come across one of your countrymen at sea. Have  you now?�    I admitted I never had. The examiner had given himself up to the spirit  of gossiping idleness. For myself, I was in no haste to leave that room.  Not in the least. The era of examinations was over. I would never  again see that friendly man who was a professional ancestor, a sort of  grandfather in the craft. Moreover, I had to wait till he dismissed me,  and of that there was no sign. As he remained silent, looking at me, I  added:    �But I have heard of one, some years ago. He seems to have been a boy  serving his time on board a Liverpool ship, if I am not mistaken.�    �What was his name?�    I told him.    �How did you say that?� he asked, puckering up his eyes at the uncouth  sound.    I repeated the name very distinctly.    �How do you spell it?�    I told him. He moved his head at the impracticable nature of that name,  and observed:    �It's quite as long as your own--isn't it?�    There was no hurry. I had passed for Master, and I had all the rest of  my life before me to make the best of it. That seemed a long time. I  went leisurely through a small mental calculation, and said:    �Not quite. Shorter by two letters, sir.�    �Is it?� The examiner pushed the signed blue slip across the table to  me, and rose from his chair. Somehow this seemed a very abrupt ending of  our relations, and I felt almost sorry to part from that excellent man,  who was master of a ship before the whisper of the sea had reached my  cradle. He offered me his hand and wished me well. He even made a few  steps towards the door with me, and ended with good-natured advice.    �I don't know what may be your plans but you ought to go into steam.  When a man has got his master's certificate it's the proper time. If I  were you I would go into steam.�    I thanked him, and shut the door behind me definitely on the era of  examinations. But that time I did not walk on air, as on the first two  occasions. I walked across the Hill of many beheadings with measured  steps. It was a fact, I said to myself, that I was now a British master  mariner beyond a doubt. It was not that I had an exaggerated sense of  that very modest achievement, with which, however, luck, opportunity,  or any extraneous influence could have had nothing to do. That  fact, satisfactory and obscure in itself, had for me a certain ideal  significance. It was an answer to certain outspoken scepticism, and even  to some not very kind aspersions. I had vindicated myself from what had  been cried upon as a stupid obstinacy or a fantastic caprice. I don't  mean to say that a whole country had been convulsed by my desire to go  to sea. But for a boy between fifteen and sixteen, sensitive enough,  in all conscience, the commotion of his little world had seemed a very  considerable thing indeed. So considerable that, absurdly enough, the  echoes of it linger to this day. I catch myself in hours of solitude and  retrospect meeting arguments and charges made thirty-five years ago by  voices now for ever still; finding things to say that an assailed  boy could not have found, simply because of the mysteriousness of his  impulses to himself. I understood no more than the people who called  upon me to explain myself. There was no precedent. I verily believe mine  was the only case of a boy of my nationality and antecedents taking  a, so to speak, standing jump out of his racial surroundings and  associations. For you must understand that there was no idea of any sort  of �career� in my call. Of Russia or Germany there could be no question.  The nationality, the antecedents, made it impossible. The feeling  against the Austrian service was not so strong, and I dare say there  would have been no difficulty in finding my way into the Naval School at  Pola. It would have meant six months' extra grinding at German, perhaps,  but I was not past the age of admission, and in other respects I was  well qualified. This expedient to palliate my folly was thought of--but  not by me. I must admit that in that respect my negative was accepted  at once. That order of feeling was comprehensible enough to the most  inimical of my critics. I was not called upon to offer explanations; the  truth is that what I had in view was not a naval career, but the sea.  There seemed no way open to it but through France. I had the language  at any rate, and of all the countries in Europe it is with France that  Poland has most connection. There were some facilities for having me a  little looked after, at first. Letters were being written, answers  were being received, arrangements were being made for my departure  for Marseilles, where an excellent fellow called Solary, got at in  a roundabout fashion through various French channels, had promised  good-naturedly to put le jeune homme in the way of getting a decent ship  for his first start if he really wanted a taste of ce metier de chien.    I watched all these preparations gratefully, and kept my own counsel.  But what I told the last of my examiners was perfectly true. Already  the determined resolve, that �if a seaman, then an English seaman,� was  formulated in my head though, of course, in the Polish language. I did  not know six words of English, and I was astute enough to understand  that it was much better to say nothing of my purpose. As it was I was  already looked upon as partly insane, at least by the more distant  acquaintances. The principal thing was to get away. I put my trust in  the good-natured Solary's very civil letter to my uncle, though I was  shocked a little by the phrase about the metier de chien.    This Solary (Baptistin), when I beheld him in the flesh, turned out a  quite young man, very good-looking, with a fine black, short beard,  a fresh complexion, and soft, merry black eyes. He was as jovial and  good-natured as any boy could desire. I was still asleep in my room in  a modest hotel near the quays of the old port, after the fatigues of  the journey via Vienna, Zurich, Lyons, when he burst in flinging the  shutters open to the sun of Provence and chiding me boisterously for  lying abed. How pleasantly he startled me by his noisy objurgations to  be up and off instantly for a �three years' campaign in the South Seas.�   O magic words! �Une campagne de trois ans dans les mers du sud�--that is  the French for a three years' deep-water voyage.    He gave me a delightful waking, and his friendliness was unwearied;  but I fear he did not enter upon the quest for a ship for me in a very  solemn spirit. He had been at sea himself, but had left off at the age  of twenty-five, finding he could earn his living on shore in a much more  agreeable manner. He was related to an incredible number of Marseilles  well-to-do families of a certain class. One of his uncle",50.91,12.4,13.3,8.48,14.3,6.82,1818,8.5,15.91,8th and 9th grade

I heard that ye were coming, so an old man bear I slew,    Just to give you kindly welcome to my home in Gundaroo.      “The times is something awful, as you can plainly see,    The banks have broke the squatters, and they've broke the likes of me;    We can't afford a bullock--such expense would never do--    So an old man bear for breakfast is a treat in Gundaroo.”      And along by Grabben Gullen, where the rushing river flows,    In the block of broken country where there's no one ever goes,    On the Upper Murrumbidgee they're a hospitable crew,    But you mustn't ask for “bullock” when you go to Gundaroo.          Lay of the Motor-Car          We're away! and the wind whistles shrewd     In our whiskers and teeth;    And the granite-like grey of the road     Seems to slide underneath.    As an eagle might sweep through the sky,     So we sweep through the land;    And the pallid pedestrians fly     When they hear us at hand.      We outpace, we outlast, we outstrip!     Not the fast-fleeing hare,    Nor the racehorses under the whip,     Nor the birds of the air    Can compete with our swiftness sublime,     Our ease and our grace.    We annihilate chickens and time     And policemen and space.      Do you mind that fat grocer who crossed?     How he dropped down to pray    In the road when he saw he was lost;     How he melted away    Underneath, and there rang through the fog     His earsplitting squeal    As he went----  Is that he or a dog,     That stuff on the wheel?          The Corner Man          I dreamed a dream at the midnight deep,     When fancies come and go    To vex a man in his soothing sleep     With thoughts of awful woe--    I dreamed that I was a corner-man     Of a nigger minstrel show.      I cracked my jokes, and the building rang     With laughter loud and long;    I hushed the house as I softly sang     An old plantation song--    A tale of the wicked slavery days     Of cruelty and wrong.      A small boy sat on the foremost seat--     A mirthful youngster he;    He beat the time with his restless feet     To each new melody,    And he picked me out as the brightest star     Of the black fraternity.      “Oh father,” he said, “what _would_ we do     If the corner-man should die?    I never saw such a man--did you?     He makes the people cry,    And then, when he likes, he makes them laugh.”      The old man made reply--      “We each of us fill a very small space     In the great creation's plan,    If a man don't keep his lead in the race     There's plenty more that can;    The world can very soon fill the place     Of even a corner-man.”           .    .    .    .    .      I woke with a jump, rejoiced to find     Myself at home in bed,    And I framed a moral in my mind     From the words the old man said.    The world will jog along just the same     When its corner-men are dead.          When Dacey Rode the Mule          'Twas to a small, up-country town,     When we were boys at school,    There came a circus with a clown,     Likewise a bucking mule.    The clown announced a scheme they had     Spectators for to bring--    They'd give a crown to any lad     Who'd ride him round the ring.          And, gentle reader, do not scoff         Nor think a man a fool--        To buck a porous-plaster off         Was pastime to that mule.      The boys got on; he bucked like sin;     He threw them in the dirt,    What time the clown would raise a grin     By asking, “Are you hurt?”     But Johnny Dacey came one night,     The crack of all the school;    Said he, “I'll win the crown all right,     Bring in your bucking mule.”          The elephant went off his trunk,         The monkey played the fool,        And all the band got blazing drunk         When Dacey rode the mule.      But soon there rose a galling shout     Of laughter, for the clown    From somewhere in his pants drew out     A little paper crown.    He placed the crown on Dacey's head     While Dacey looked a fool;    “Now, there's your crown, my lad,” he said,     “For riding of the mule!”          The band struck up with “Killaloe”,         And “Rule Britannia, Rule”,        And “Young Man from the Country”, too,         When Dacey rode the mule.      Then Dacey, in a furious rage,     For vengeance on the show    Ascended to the monkeys' cage     And let the monkeys go;    The blue-tailed ape and chimpanzee     He turned abroad to roam;    Good faith!  It was a sight to see     The people step for home.          For big baboons with canine snout         Are spiteful, as a rule--        The people didn't sit it out         When Dacey rode the mule.      And from the beasts that made escape,     The bushmen all declare,    Were born some creatures partly ape     And partly native-bear.    They're rather few and far between,     The race is nearly spent;    But some of them may still be seen     In Sydney Parliament.          And when those legislators fight,         And drink, and act the fool,        Just blame it on that torrid night         When Dacey rode the mule.          The Mylora Elopement          By the winding Wollondilly where the weeping willows weep,    And the shepherd, with his billy, half awake and half asleep,    Folds his fleecy flocks that linger homewards in the setting sun,    Lived my hero, Jim the Ringer, “cocky” on Mylora Run.      Jimmy loved the super's daughter, Miss Amelia Jane McGrath.    Long and earnestly he sought her, but he feared her stern papa;    And Amelia loved him truly--but the course of love, if true,    Never yet ran smooth or duly, as I think it ought to do.      Watching with his slow affection once Jim saw McGrath the boss    Riding out by Jim's selection, looking for a station 'oss    That was running in the ranges with a mob of outlaws wild.    Old McGrath “Good day” exchanges--off goes Jim to see his child;      Says, “The old man's after Stager, which he'll find is no light job,    And to-morrow I will wager he will try and yard the mob.    Will you come with me to-morrow?  I will let the parson know,    And for ever, joy or sorrow, he will join us here below.      “I will bring my nags so speedy, Crazy Jane and Tambourine,    One more kiss--don't think I'm greedy--good-bye, lass, before I'm seen--    Just one more--God bless you, dearie!  Don't forget to meet me here,    Life without you is but weary; now, once more, good-bye, my dear.”           .    .    .    .    .      The daylight shines on figures twain    That ride across Mylora plain,    Laughing and talking--Jim and Jane.    “Steadily, darling.  There's lots of time,    Didn't we slip the old man prime!    I knew he'd tackle that Bowneck mob,    I reckon he'll find it too big a job.    They've beaten us all.  I had a try,    But the warrigal devils seem to fly.    That Sambo's a real good bit of stuff    No doubt, but not quite good enough.    He'll have to gallop the livelong day,    To cut and come, to race and stay.    I hope he yards 'em, 'twill do him good;    To see us going I don't think would.”     A turn in the road and, fair and square,    They meet the old man standing there.    “What's up?”  “Why, running away, of course,”     Says Jim, emboldened.  The old man turned,    His eye with wild excitement burned.    “I've raced all day through the scorching heat    After old Bowneck:  and now I'm beat.    But over that range I think you'll find    The Bowneck mob all run stone-blind.    Will you go and leave the mob behind?    Which will you do?  Take the girl away,    Or ride like a white man should to-day,    And yard old Bowneck?  Go or stay?”     Says Jim, “I can't throw this away,    We can bolt some other day, of course,    Amelia Jane, get off that horse.    Up you get, Old Man.  Whoop, halloo.    Here goes to put old Bowneck through!”     Two distant specks on the mountain side,    Two stockwhips echoing far and wide.    Amelia Jane sat down and cried.           .    .    .    .    .      “Sakes, Amelia, what's up now?    Leading old Sambo, too, I vow,    And him dead beat.  Where have you been?    “Bolted with Jim!  What _do_ you mean?”     “Met the old man with Sambo licked    From running old Bowneck.”  “Well, I'm kicked--    Ran 'em till Sambo nearly dropped?    What did Jim do when you were stopped?    Did you bolt from father across the plain?    Jim made you get off Crazy Jane!    And father got on, and away again    The two of 'em went to the ranges grim.    Good boy, Jimmy!  Well done, Jim!    They're sure to get them now, of course,    That Tambourine is a spanking horse.    And Crazy Jane is good as gold.    And Jim, they say, rides pretty bold;    Not like your father, but very fair.    Jim will have to follow the mare.”     “It never was yet in father's hide    To best my Jim on the mountain-side.    Jim can rally, and Jim can ride.”     But here again Amelia cried.           .    .    .    .    .      The sound of a whip comes faint and far,    A rattle of hoofs, and here they are,    In all their tameless pride.    The fleet wild horses snort with fear,    And wheel and break as the yard draws near.    Now, Jim the Ringer, ride!    Wheel 'em! wheel 'em!  Whoa back there, whoa!    And the foam-flakes fly like the driven snow,    As under the whip the horses go    Adown the mountain side.    And Jim, hands down, and teeth firm set,    On a horse that never has failed him yet,    Is after them down the range.    Well ridden! well ridden! they wheel--whoa back!    And long and loud the stockwhips crack,    Their flying course they change,    “Steadily does it--let Sambo go!    Open those sliprails down below.    Smart! or you'll be too late.    They'll follow old Sambo up--look out!    Wheel that black horse--give Sam a clout.    They're in!  Make fast the gate.”           .    .    .    .    .      The mob is safely in the yard!    The old man mounts delighted guard.    No thought has he but for his prize.    Jim catches poor Amelia's eyes.    “Will you come after all? the job is done,    And Crazy Jane is fit to run    For a prince's life--now don't say no;    Slip on while the old man's down below    At the inner yard, and away we'll go.    Will you come, my girl?”  “I will, you bet,    We'll manage this here elopement yet.”           .    .    .    .    .      By the winding Wollondilly stands the hut of Ringer Jim.    And his loving little Meely makes a perfect god of him.    He has stalwart sons and daughters, and, I think, before he's done,    There'll be numerous “Six-fortys” taken on Mylora run.          The Pannikin Poet          There's nothing here sublime,    But just a roving rhyme,    Run off to pass the time,     With nought titanic in    The theme that it supports,    And, though it treats of quarts,    It's bare of golden thoughts--     It's just a pannikin.      I think it's rather hard    That each Australian bard--    Each wan, poetic card--     With thoughts galvanic in    His fiery soul alight,    In wild aerial flight,    Will sit him down and write     About a pannikin.      He makes some new-chum fare    From out his English lair    To hunt the native bear,     That curious mannikin;    And then when times get bad    That wandering English lad    Writes out a message sad     Upon his pannikin:      “Oh, mother, think of me    Beneath the wattle tree”     (For you may bet that he     Will drag the wattle in)    “Oh, mother, here I think    That I shall have to sink,    There ain't a single drink     The water-bottle in.”      The dingo homeward hies,    The sooty crows uprise    And caw their fierce surprise     A tone Satanic in;    And bearded bushmen tread    Around the sleeper's head--    “See here--the bloke is dead!     Now where's his pannikin?”      They read his words and weep,    And lay him down to sleep    Where wattle-branches sweep,     A style mechanic in;    And, reader, that's the way    The poets of to-day    Spin out their little lay     About a pannikin.          Not on It          The new chum's polo pony was the smartest pony yet--    The owner backed it for the Cup for all that he could get.    The books were laying fives to one, in tenners; and you bet                He was on it.      The bell was rung, the nags came out their quality to try,    The band played “What Ho! Robbo!” as our hero cantered by,    The people in the Leger Stand cried out, “Hi, Mister, Hi!                Are you on it?”      They watched him as the flag went down; his fate is quickly told--    The pony gave a sudden spring, and off the rider rolled.    The pony finished first all right, but then our hero bold                Was not on it.          The Protest          I say 'e _isn't_ Remorse!     'Ow do I know?

Bumper Maginnis and I,     After a “go”,    Walkin' our 'orses to dry,     I says, “Hello!    What's that old black goin' by?”      Bumper says “Oh!    That's an old cuddy of Flanagan's--     Runs as The Crow!”      Now they make out 'e's Remorse.     Well, but I _know_.    Soon as I came on the course     I says “'Ello!     'Ere's the old Crow.”     Once a man's seen any 'orse,     'Course 'e must know.    Sure as there's wood in this table,     I say 'e's The Crow.          (Cross-examined by the Committee.)

What was the brand on 'is 'ide?     _I_ couldn't say,    Brands can be transmogrified.     That ain't the way--    It's the _look_ of a 'orse and the way that 'e moves     That I'd know any day.      What was the boy on 'is back?     Why, 'e went past    All of a minute, and off down the track.    --“The 'orse went as fast?”     True, so 'e did!  But, my eyes, what a treat!    'Ow can I notice the 'ands and the seat    Of each bumble-faced kid of a boy that I meet?     Lor'!  What a question to ast!          (Protest dismissed.)          The Scapegoat          We have all of us read how the Israelites fled    From Egypt with Pharaoh in eager pursuit of 'em,    And Pharaoh's fierce troop were all put “in the soup”     When the water rolled softly o'er every galoot of 'em.    The Jews were so glad when old Pharaoh was “had”     That they sounded their timbrels and capered like mad.    You see he was hated from Jordan to Cairo--    Whence comes the expression “to buck against faro”.      For forty long years, 'midst perils and fears    In deserts with never a tramline to follow by,    The Israelite horde went roaming abroad    Like so many sundowners out on the wallaby.    When Moses, who led 'em, and taught 'em, and fed 'em,    Was dying, he murmured “A rorty old hoss you are:    I give you command of the whole of the band”--    And handed the Government over to Joshua.           .    .    .    .    .      But Moses told 'em before he died,    “Wherever you are, whatever betide,    Every year as the time draws near    By lot or by rote choose you a goat,    And let the high priest confess on the beast    The sins of the people, the worst and the least.    Lay your sins on the goat!  Sure the plan ought to suit yer,    Because all your sins are “his troubles” in future.    Then lead him away to the wilderness black    To die with the weight of your sins on his back:    Of thirst let him perish alone and unshriven,    For thus shall your sins be absolved and forgiven!”      'Tis needless to say, though it reeked of barbarity,    This scapegoat arrangement gained great popularity.    By this means a Jew, whate'er he might do,    Though he burgled, or murdered, or cheated at loo,    Or meat on Good Friday (a sin most terrific) ate,    Could get his discharge, like a bankrupt's certificate.    (Just here let us note--_DID THEY CHOOSE THEIR BEST GOAT?_    It's food for conjecture; to judge from the picture    By Hunt in the Gallery close to our door, a    Man well might suppose that the scapegoat they chose    Was a long way from being their choicest Angora.    In fact I should think he was one of their weediest;    'Tis a rule that obtains, no matter who reigns,    When making a sacrifice, offer the seediest;    Which accounts for a theory known to my hearers    Who live in the wild by the wattle beguiled,    That a “stag” makes quite good enough mutton for shearers.)    Be that as it may, as each year passed away,    A scapegoat was led to the desert and freighted    With sin (the poor brute must have been overweighted)    And left there--to die as his fancy dictated.           .    .    .    .    .      The day it has come; with trumpet and drum,    With pomp and solemnity fit for the tomb,    They led the old billy-goat off to his doom:    On every hand a reverend band,    Prophets and preachers and elders stand    And the oldest rab_bi_, with a tear in his eye,    Delivers a sermon to all standing by.    (We haven't his name--whether Cohen or Harris, he    No doubt was the “poisonest” kind of a Pharisee.)    The sermon was marked by a deal of humility    And pointed the fact, with no end of ability,    That being a Gentile's no mark of gentility,    And, according to Samuel, would certainly d--n you well.    Then, shedding his coat, he approaches the goat    And, while a red fillet he carefully pins on him,    Confesses the whole of the Israelites' sins on him.    With this eloquent burst he exhorts the accurst--    “Go forth in the desert and perish in woe,    The sins of the people are whiter than snow!”     Then signs to his pal for to let the brute go.      The animal, freed from all restraint    Lowered his head, made a kind of a feint,    And charged straight at that elderly saint.    So fierce his attack, and so very severe, it    Quite floored the Rabbi, who, ere he could fly,    Was rammed on the--no, not the back--but just near it.    The scapegoat he snorted, and wildly cavorted,    A light-hearted antelope “out on the ramp”,    Then stopped, looked around, got the “lay of the ground”,    And made a bee-line back again to the camp.    The elderly priest, as he noticed the beast    So gallantly making his way to the East,    Says he:  “From the tents may I never more roam again    If that there old billy-goat ain't going home again.    He's hurrying, too!  This never will do.    Can't somebody stop him?  I'm all of a stew.    After all our confessions, so openly granted,    He's taking our sins back to where they're not wanted.    We've come all this distance salvation to win agog,    If he takes home our sins--it'll burst up the Synagogue!”      He turned to an Acolyte making his bacca light,    A fleet-footed youth who could run like a crack o' light.    “Run, Abraham, run!  Hunt him over the plain,    And drive back the brute to the desert again.    The Sphinx is a-watching, the Pyramids frown on you,    From those granite tops forty cent'ries look down on you--    Run, Abraham, run!  I'll bet half-a-crown on you.”     So Abraham ran; like a man did he go for him,    But the goat made it clear each time he drew near    That he had what the racing men call “too much toe” for him.      The crowd with great eagerness studied the race--    “Great Scott! isn't Abraham forcing the pace--    And don't the goat spiel?  It is hard to keep sight on him,    The sins of the Israelites ride mighty light on him.    The scapegoat is leading a furlong or more,    And Abraham's tiring--I'll lay six to four!    He rolls in his stride; he's done, there's no question!”     But here the old Rabbi brought up a suggestion.    ['Twas strange that in racing he showed so much cunning),    “It's a hard race,” said he, “and I think it would be    A good thing for someone to take up the running.”     As soon said as done, they started to run--    The priests and the deacons, strong runners and weak 'uns    All reckoned ere long to come up with the brute,    And so the whole boiling set off in pursuit.    And then it came out, as the rabble and rout    Streamed over the desert with many a shout--    The Rabbi so elderly, grave, and patrician,    Had been in his hot youth a bold metallician,    And offered, in gasps, as they merrily spieled,    “Any price Abraham!  Evens the field!”     Alas! the whole clan, they raced and they ran,    And Abraham proved him an “even-time” man,    But the goat, now a speck they could scarce keep their eyes on,    Stretched out in his stride in a style most surprisin'    And vanished ere long o'er the distant horizon.      Away in the camp the bill-sticker's tramp    Is heard as he wanders with paste, brush, and notices,    And paling and wall he plasters them all,    “I wonder how's things gettin' on with the goat,” he says,    Then pulls out his bills, “Use Solomon's Pills”:    “Great Stoning of Christians!  To all devout Jews! you all    Must each bring a stone--Great sport will be shown;    Enormous Attractions!  And prices as usual!    Roll up to the Hall!!  Wives, children, and all,    For naught the most delicate feelings to hurt is meant!”     Here his eyes opened wide, for close by his side    Was the scapegoat devouring the latest advertisement!    One shriek from him burst--“You creature accurst!”     And he ran from the spot like one fearing the worst.    His language was chaste, as he fled in his haste,    But the goat stayed behind him--and “scoffed up” the paste.      With downcast head, and sorrowful tread,    The people came back from the desert in dread.    “The goat--was he back there?  Had anyone heard of him?”     In very short order they got plenty word of him,    In fact as they wandered by street, lane and hall,    “The trail of the serpent was over them all.”     A poor little child knocked out stiff in the gutter    Proclaimed that the scapegoat was bred for a “butter”.    The billsticker's pail told a sorrowful tale,    The scapegoat had licked it as dry as a nail;    He raced through their houses, and frightened their spouses,    But his latest achievement most anger arouses,    For while they were searching, and scratching their craniums,    One little Ben Ourbed, who looked in the flower-bed,    Discovered him, eating the Rabbi's geraniums.                    Moral:      The moral is patent to all the beholders--    Don't shift your own sins on to other folk's shoulders;    Be kind to dumb creatures and never abuse them,    Nor curse them nor kick them, nor spitefully use them;    Take their lives if needs must--when it comes to the worst,    But don't let them perish of hunger or thirst.    Remember, no matter how far you may roam,    That dogs, goats, and chickens, it's simply the dickens    Their talent stupendous for “getting back home”.    Your sins, without doubt, will aye find you out,    And so will a scapegoat, he's bound to achieve it--    But, die in the wilderness?  Don't you believe it!          An Evening in Dandaloo          It was while we held our races--    Hurdles, sprints and steeplechases--     Up in Dandaloo,    That a crowd of Sydney stealers,    Jockeys, pugilists and spielers    Brought some horses, real heelers,     Came and put us through.      Beat our nags and won our money,    Made the game by no means funny,     Made us rather blue;    When the racing was concluded,    Of our hard-earned coin denuded    Dandaloonies sat and brooded     There in Dandaloo.           .    .    .    .    .      Night came down on Johnson's shanty    Where the grog was no means scanty,     And a tumult grew    Till some wild, excited person    Galloped down the township cursing,    “Sydney push have mobbed Macpherson,     Roll up, Dandaloo!”      Great St. Denis! what commotion!    Like the rush of stormy ocean     Fiery horsemen flew.    Dust and smoke and din and rattle,    Down the street they spurred their cattle    To the war-cry of the battle,     “Wade in, Dandaloo!”      So the boys might have their fight out,    Johnson blew the bar-room light out,     Then, in haste, withdrew.    And in darkness and in doubting    Raged the conflict and the shouting,    “Give the Sydney push a clouting,     Go it, Dandaloo!”      Jack Macpherson seized a bucket,    Every head he saw he struck it--     Struck in earnest, too;    And a man from Lower Wattle,    Whom a shearer tried to throttle,    Hit out freely with a bottle,     There in Dandaloo.      Skin and hair were flying thickly,    When a light was fetched, and quickly     Brought a fact to view--    On the scene of the diversion    Every single, solid person    Come along to help Macpherson--     _All_ were Dandaloo!”      When the list of slain was tabled,    Some were drunk and some disabled,     Still we found it true.    In the darkness and the smother    We'd been belting one another;    Jack Macpherson bashed his brother     There in Dandaloo.      So we drank, and all departed--    How the “mobbing” yarn was started     No one ever knew--    And the stockmen tell the story    Of that conflict fierce and gory,    How we fought for love and glory     Up in Dandaloo.      It's a proverb now, or near it--    At the races you can hear it,     At the dog-fights, too!    Every shrieking, dancing drover    As the canines topple over    Yells applause to Grip or Rover,     “Give him 'Dandaloo'!”      And the teamster slowly toiling    Through the deep black country, soiling     Wheels and axles, too,    Lays the whip on Spot and Banker,    Rouses Tarboy with a flanker--    “Redman!  Ginger!  Heave there!  Yank her!     Wade in, Dandaloo!”          A Ballad of Ducks          The railway rattled and roared and swung    With jolting carriage and bumping trucks.    The sun, like a billiard red ball, hung    In the Western sky:  and the tireless tongue    Of the wild-eyed man in the corner told    This terrible tale of the days of old,    And the party that ought to have kept the ducks.      “Well, it ain't all joy bein' on the land    With an overdraft that'd knock you flat;    And the rabbits have pretty well took command;    But the hardest thing for a man to stand    Is the feller who says 'Well, I told you so!    You should ha' done this way, don't you know!'--    I could lay a bait for a man like that.      “The grasshoppers struck us in ninety-one    And what they leave--well, it ain't 'de luxe'.    But a growlin' fault-findin' son of a gun    Who'd lent some money to stock our run--    I said they'd eaten what grass we had--    Says he, 'Your management's very bad,    You had a right to have kept some ducks!'      “To have kept some ducks!  And the place was white!    Wherever you went you had to tread    On grasshoppers guzzlin' day and night;    And when with a swoosh they rose in flight,    If you didn't look out for yourself they'd fly    Like bullets into your open eye    And knock it out of the back of your head.      “There isn't a turkey or goose or swan,    Or a duck that quacks, or a hen that clucks,    Can make a difference on a run    When a grasshopper plague has once begun;    'If you'd finance us,' I says, 'I'd buy    Ten thousand emus and have a try;    The job,' I says, 'is too big for ducks!      “'You must fetch a duck when you come to stay;    A great big duck--a Muscovy toff--    Ready and fit,' I says, 'for the fray;    And if the grasshoppers come our way    You turn your duck into the lucerne patch,    And I'd be ready to make a match    That the grasshoppers eats his feathers off!'      “He came to visit us by and by,    And it just so happened one day in Spring    A kind of a cloud came over the sky--    A wall of grasshoppers nine miles high,    And nine miles thick, and nine hundred wide,    Flyin' in regiments, side by side,    And eatin' up every living thing.      “All day long, like a shower of rain,    You'd hear 'em smackin' against the wall,    Tap, tap, tap, on the window pane,    And they'd rise and jump at the house again    Till their crippled carcases piled outside.    But what did it matter if thousands died--    A million wouldn't be missed at all.      “We were drinkin' grasshoppers--so to speak--    Till we skimmed their carcases off the spring;    And they fell so thick in the station creek    They choked the waterholes all the week.    There was scarcely room for a trout to rise,    And they'd only take artificial flies--    They got so sick of the real thing.      “An Arctic snowstorm was beat to rags    When the hoppers rose for their morning flight    With a flapping noise like a million flags:    And the kitchen chimney was stuffed with bags    For they'd fall right into the fire, and fry    Till the cook sat down and began to cry--    And never a duck or a fowl in sight!      “We strolled across to the railroad track--    Under a cover, beneath some trucks,    I sees a feather and hears a quack;    I stoops and I pulls the tarpaulin back--    Every duck in the place was there,    No good to them was the open air.    'Mister,' I says, 'There's your blanky ducks!'”          Tommy Corrigan          (Killed, Steeplechasing at Flemington.)          You talk of riders on the flat, of nerve and pluck and pace,    Not one in fifty has the nerve to ride a steeplechase.    It's right enough while horses pull and take their fences strong,    To rush a flier to the front and bring the field along;    But what about the last half-mile, with horses blown and beat--    When every jump means all you know to keep him on his feet?      When any slip means sudden death--with wife and child to keep--    It needs some nerve to draw the whip and flog him at the leap--    But Corrigan would ride them out, by danger undismayed,    He never flinched at fence or wall, he never was afraid;    With easy seat and nerve of steel, light hand and smiling face,    He held the rushing horses back, and made the sluggards race.      He gave the shirkers extra heart, he steadied down the rash,    He rode great clumsy boring brutes, and chanced a fatal smash;    He got the rushing Wymlet home that never jumped at all--    But clambered over every fence and clouted every wall.    But ah, you should have heard the cheers that shook the members' stand    Whenever Tommy Corrigan weighed out to ride Lone Hand.      They were, indeed, a glorious pair--the great upstanding horse,    The gamest jockey on his back that ever faced a course.    Though weight was big and pace was hot and fences stiff and tall,    “You follow Tommy Corrigan” was passed to one and all.    And every man on Ballarat raised all he could command    To put on Tommy Corrigan when riding old Lone Hand.      But now we'll keep his memory green while horsemen come and go,    We may not see his like again where silks and satins glow.    We'll drink to him in silence, boys--he's followed down the track    Where many a good man went before, but never one came back.    And let us hope in that far land where shades of brave men reign,    That gallant Tommy Corrigan will ride Lone Hand again.          The Maori's Wool          _Now, this is just a simple tale to tell the reader how    They civilised the Maori tribe at Rooti-iti-au._           .    .    .    .    .      The Maoris are a mighty race--the finest ever known;    Before the missionaries came they worshipped wood and stone;    They went to war and fought like fiends, and when the war was done    They pacified their conquered foes by eating every one.    But now-a-days about the pahs in idleness they lurk,    Prepared to smoke or drink or talk--or anything but work.    The richest tribe in all the North in sheep and horse and cow    Were those who led their simple lives at Rooti-iti-au.      'Twas down to town at Wellington a noble Maori came,    A Rangatira of the best, Rerenga was his name--    (The word Rerenga means a “snag”--but until he was gone    This didn't strike the folk he met--it struck them later on).    He stalked into the Bank they call the “Great Financial Hell”,    And told the Chief Financial Fiend the tribe had wool to sell.    The Bold Bank Manager looked grave--the price of wool was high.    He said, “We'll lend you what you need--we're not disposed to buy.    You ship the wool to England, Chief!--You'll find it's good advice,    And meanwhile you can draw from us the local market price.”     The Chief he thanked him courteously and said he wished to state    In all the Rooti-iti tribe his mana would be great,    But still the tribe were simple folk, and did not understand    This strange finance that gave them cash without the wool in hand.    So off he started home again, with trouble on his brow,    To lay the case before the tribe at Rooti-iti-au.      They held a great korero in the Rooti-iti clan,    With speeches lasting half a day from every leading man.    They called themselves poetic names--“lost children in a wood”;    They said the Great Bank Manager was Kapai--extra good!    And so they sent Rerenga down, full-powered and well-equipped,    To draw as much as he could get, and let the wool be shipped;    And wedged into a “Cargo Tank”, full up from stern to bow,    A mighty clip of wool went Home from Rooti-iti-au.      It was the Bold Bank Manager who drew a heavy cheque;    Rerenga cashed it thoughtfully, then clasped him round the neck;    A hug from him was not at all a thing you'd call a lark--    You see he lived on mutton-birds and dried remains of shark--    But still it showed his gratitude, and, as he pouched the pelf,    “I'll haka for you, sir,” he said, “in honour of yourself!”     The haka is a striking dance--the sort they don't allow    In any place more civilised than Rooti-iti-au.      He “haka'd” most effectively--then, with an airy grace    Rubbed noses with the Manager, and vanished into space.    But when the wool-return came back, ah me, what sighs and groans!    For every bale of Maori wool was loaded up with stones!    Yes--thumping great New Zealand rocks among the wool they found;    On every rock the Bank had lent just seven pence a pound.    And now the Bold Bank Manager, with trouble on his brow,    Is searching vainly for the chief from Rooti-iti-au.          The Angel's Kiss          An angel stood beside the bed    Where lay the living and the dead.      He gave the mother--her who died--    A kiss that Christ the Crucified      Had sent to greet the weary soul    When, worn and faint, it reached its goal.      He gave the infant kisses twain,    One on the breast, one on the brain.      “Go forth into the world,” he said,    “With blessings on your heart and head,      “For God, who ruleth righteously,    Hath ordered that to such as be      “From birth deprived of mother's love,    I bring His blessing from above;      “But if the mother's life He spare    Then she is made God's messenger      “To kiss and pray that heart and brain    May go through life without a stain.”      The infant moved towards the light,    The angel spread his wings in flight.      But each man carries to his grave    The kisses that in hopes to save    The angel or his mother gave.          Sunrise on the Coast          Grey dawn on the sand-hills--the night wind has drifted     All night from the rollers a scent of the sea;    With the dawn the grey fog his battalions has lifted,     At the call of the morning they scatter and flee.      Like mariners calling the roll of their number     The sea-fowl put out to the infinite deep.    And far over-head--sinking softly to slumber--     Worn out by their watching, the stars fall asleep.      To eastward, where resteth the dome of the skies on     The sea-line, stirs softly the curtain of night;    And far from behind the enshrouded horizon     Comes the voice of a God saying “Let there be light.”      And lo, there is light!  Evanescent and tender,     It glows ruby-red where 'twas now ashen-grey;    And purple and scarlet and gold in its splendour--     Behold, 'tis that marvel, the birth of a day!          The Reveille          Trumpets of the Lancer Corps,     Sound a loud reveille;    Sound it over Sydney shore,    Send the message far and wide    Down the Richmond River side--    Boot and saddle, mount and ride,     Sound a loud reveille.      Whither go ye, Lancers gay,     With your bold reveille?    O'er the ocean far away    From your sunny southern home,    Over leagues of trackless foam,    In a foreign land to roam     With your bold reveille.      When we hear our brethren call,     Sound a clear reveille.    Then we answer, one and all,    Answer that the world may see,    “Of the English stock are we,    At their side we still will be”--     That's our bold reveille.

[End Original Advertisement]            About the author:    Andrew Barton Paterson was born on 17 February 1864 at Narambla, New  South Wales.  He lived at Illalong station until he was ten, when he  went to Sydney to attend school.  He trained as a solicitor (a type of  lawyer) but also contributed some verse to the Sydney “Bulletin” under  the pseudonym of “The Banjo”, taken from the name of a horse. His first  book, “The Man from Snowy River”, was published in 1895, and has sold  more copies than any other book of Australian poetry. He later gave up  law to become a journalist, and went to South Africa to report on the  Boer War.  When World War I broke out he sought work as a war  correspondent, but failed to get it. He then went to work driving an  ambulance in France, and later became a Remount Officer with the  Australian forces then in Egypt. After returning to Australia in 1919 he  continued as a writer, and died in Sydney on 5 February 1941.    Paterson's most famous work is “Waltzing Matilda”, written in 1895, and  now an unofficial anthem of Australia.  “The Man from Snowy River” has  since become the inspiration for a well-known movie of the same name,  and even a series on a cable television network.  “Clancy of the  Overflow” is similarly well known.

14,Criminal Psychologyr,"the  infusion of dampness into an old MS. Draper also brings a physical  example: If you put a flat object upon the surface of a cold, smooth  metal and then breathe on the metal and, after the moisture has  disappeared, remove the object, you may recall its image months after,  whenever you breathe on the place in question. Another has called memory  the safe of the mind. It is the opinion of E. Hering[214] that what we  once were conscious of and are conscious of again, does not endure as  image but as echo such as may be heard in a tuning fork when it is  properly struck. Reid asserts that memory does not have present ideas,  but past things for its object. Natorp explains recollection as an  identification of the unidentical, of not-now with now. According to  Herbart and his school,[215] memory consists in the possibility of  recognizing the molecular arrangements which had been left by past  impressions in the ganglion cells, and in reading them in identical  fashion. According to Wundt and his pupils, the problem is one of the  disposition of the central organs. And it is the opinion of James Mill  that the content of recollection is not only the idea of the remembered  object, but also the idea that the object had been experienced before.  Both ideas together constitute the whole of that state of mind which we  denote as memory. Spinoza[216] deals freely with memory, and asserts  that mankind does not control it inasmuch as all thoughts, ideas,  resolutions of spirits, are bare results of memories, so that human  freedom is excluded. Uphues[217] distinguishes between memory and the  conception which is presupposed in the recognition of an object  different from that conception. This is the theory developed by  Aristotle.    According to Berkeley and Hume recognition is not directed upon a  different object, nor does it presuppose one; the activity of  recognition consists either in the exhibition or the creation of the  object. Recognition lends the idea an independence which does not belong  to it and in that way turns it into a thing, objectifies it, and posits  it as substantial. Maudsley makes use of the notion that it is possible  to represent any former content of consciousness as attended to so that  it may again come into the center of the field of consciousness.  Dorner[218] explains recognition as follows: “The possible is not only  the merely possible in opposition to the actual; it is much more proper  to conceive being as possible, i.e., as amenable to logical thinking;  without this there could be no recognition.” Külpe[219] concerns himself  with the problem of the difference between perceptive images and memory  images and whether the latter are only weaker than the former as English  philosophers and psychologists assert. He concludes that they are not  so.    When we take all these opinions concerning memory together we conclude  that neither any unity nor any clear description of the matter has been  attained. Ebbinghaus’s sober statement may certainly be correct: “Our  knowledge of memory rises almost exclusively from the observation of  extreme, especially striking cases. Whenever we ask about more special  solutions concerning the detail of what has been counted up, and their  other relations of dependence, their structure, etc., there are no  answers.”    Nobody has as yet paid attention to the simple daily events which  constitute the routine of the criminalists. We find little instruction  concerning them, and our difficulties as well as our mistakes are  thereby increased. Even the modern repeatedly cited experimental  investigations have no direct bearing upon our work.    We will content ourselves with viewing the individual conceptions of  memory and recollection as occurring in particular cases and with  considering them, now one, now the other, according to the requirements  of the case. We shall consider the general relation of “reproduction” to  memory. “Reproduction” we shall consider in a general sense and shall  subsume under it also the so-called involuntary reproductions which rise  in the forms and qualities of past events without being evoked, i.e.,  which rise with the help of unconscious activity through the more or  less independent association of ideas. Exactly this unconscious  reproduction, this apparently involuntary activity, is perhaps the most  fruitful, and we therefore unjustly meet with unexceptionable distrust  the later sudden “occurrence,” especially when these occurrences happen  to defendant and his witnesses. It is true that they frequently deceive  us because behind the sudden occurrence there often may be nothing more  than a better training and instruction from experienced cell-mates;  though very often the circumstances are such that the suspect has  succeeded through some released prisoner, or by a blackened letter, in  sending a message from his prison, by means of which false witnesses of  alibi, etc., are provided. Distrust is in any event justified, when his  most important witnesses suddenly “occur” to the accused. But this does  not always happen, and we find in our own experience evidence of the  fact that memory and the capacity to recall something often depend upon  health, feeling, location, and chance associations which can not be  commanded, and happen as accidentally as anything in life can. That we  should remember anything at all depends upon the point of time.  Everybody knows how important twilight may be for memory. Indeed,  twilight has been called the visiting-hour of recollection, and it is  always worth while to observe the situation when anybody asserts that  some matter of importance occurred to him in the twilight. Such an  assertion merits, at least, further examination. Now, if we only know  how these occurrences constitute themselves, it would not be difficult  to study them out and to estimate their probability. But we do not know,  and we have to depend, primarily, on observation and test. Not one of  the theories applied is supported by experience altogether.    They may be divided into three essential groups.    1. What is received, fades away, becomes a “trace,” and is more or less  overlaid by new perceptions. When these latter are ever set aside, the  old trace comes into the foreground.    2. The ideas sink, darken, and disintegrate. If they receive support and  intensification they regain complete clearness.    3. The ideas crumble up, lose their parts. When anything occurs that  reunites them and restores what is lost, they become whole again.    Ebbinghaus maintains, correctly enough, that not one of these  explanations is universally satisfactory, but it must be granted that  now one, now another is useful in controlling this or that particular  case. The processes of the destruction of an idea, may be as various as  those of the destruction and restoration of a building. If a building is  destroyed by fire, I certainly can not explain the image given by merely  assuming that it was the victim of the hunger of time. A building which  has suffered because of the sinking of the earth I shall have to image  by quite other means than those I would use if it had been destroyed by  water.    For the same reason when, in court, somebody asserts a sudden  “occurrence,” or when we want to help him and something occurs to him,  we shall have to proceed in different fashion and determine our action  empirically by the conditions of the moment. We shall have to go back,  with the help of the witness, to the beginning of the appearance of the  idea in question and study its development as far as the material  permits us. In a similar manner we must make use of every possibility of  explanation when we are studying the disappearance of ideas. At one  point or another we shall find certain connections. One chief mistake in  such reconstructive work lies in overlooking the fact that no individual  is merely passive when he receives sensations; he is bound to make use  of a certain degree of activity. Locke and Bonnet have already mentioned  this fact, and anybody may verify it by comparing his experiments of  trying to avoid seeing or hearing, and trying actively to see or to  hear. For this reason it is foolish to ask anybody how it happened that  he perceived less than another, because both have equally good senses  and were able to perceive as much. On the other hand, the grade of  activity each has made use of in perception is rarely inquired into, and  this is the more unfortunate because memory is often proportionate to  activity. If, then, we are to explain how various statements concerning  contemporaneous matters, observed a long time ago, are to be combined,  it will not be enough to compare the memory, sensory acuteness, and  intelligence of the witnesses. The chief point of attention should be  the activity which has been put in motion during the sense-perception in  question.      Section 53. (b) The Forms of Reproduction.    Kant analyzes memory:    1. As apprehending something in memory.    2. As retaining it for a long time.    3. As immediately recalling it.    One might, perhaps add, as 4: that the memory-image is most conformable  to the actual one. This is not identical with the fact that we recollect  at all. It is to be assumed that the forms of memory-images vary very  much with different persons, because each individual verifies his images  of various objects variously. I know two men equally well for an equal  time, and yet have two memory-images of them. When I recall one, a  life-sized, moving, and moved figure appears before me, even the very  man himself; when I think of the other, I see only a small, bare  silhouette, foggy and colorless, and the difference does not require  that the first shall be an interesting and the second a boresome  individual. This is still clearer in memory of travels. One city appears  in recollection with size, color and movement, real; the other, in which  I sojourned for the same length of time and only a few days later, under  similar conditions of weather, etc., appears like a small, flat  photograph. Inquiry reveals that this is as true of other people as of  me, and that the problem of memory is much differentiated by the method  of recollection. In fact, this is so little in doubt that at some  periods of time there are more images of one sort than of another and  what is a rule for one kind of individual is an exception for another.    Now there is a series of phenomena for which we possess particular types  of images which often have little to do with the things themselves. So  Exner says: “We might know the physiognomy of an individual very  accurately, be able to pick him out among a thousand, without being  clear about the differences between him and another; indeed, we often do  not know the color of his eyes and hair, yet marvel when it suddenly  becomes different.”    Kries[220] calls attention to another fact: “When we try to mark in  memory the contour of a very well-known coin, we deceive ourselves,  unbelievably--when we see the coin the size we imagine it to be, we  wonder still more.”    Lotze shows correctly that memory never brings back a blinding flash of  light, or the over-powering blow of an explosion with the intensity of  the image in proper relation to the impression. I believe that it is not  necessary to go so far, for example, and hold that not even the  sparkling of a star, the crack of a pistol, etc., are kept in memory  with more than partial implication of the event. Maudsley points out  correctly that we can have no memory of pain--“because the disturbance  of nervous elements disappears just as soon as their integrity is again  established.” Perhaps, also, because when the pain has disappeared, the  tertium comparationis is lacking. But one need not limit oneself to  pain, but may assert that we lack memory of all unpleasant sensations.  The first time one jumps into the water from a very high spring-board,  the first time one’s horse rises over a hurdle, or the first time the  bullets whistle past one’s ear in battle, are all most unpleasant  experiences, and whoever denies it is deceiving himself or his friends.  But when we think of them we feel that they were not so bad, that one  merely was very much afraid, etc. But this is not the case; there is  simply no memory for these sensations.    This fact is of immense importance in examination and I believe that no  witness has been able effectively to describe the pain caused by a body  wound, the fear roused by arson, the fright at a threat, not, indeed,  because he lacked the words to do so, but because he had not sufficient  memory for these impressions, and because he has nothing to-day with  which to compare them. Time, naturally, in such cases makes a great  difference, and if a man were to describe his experiences shortly after  their uncomfortable occurrence he would possibly remember them better  than he would later on. Here, if the examiner has experienced something  similar, years ago, he is likely to accuse the witness of exaggeration  under the belief that his own experience has shown the thing to be not  so bad. Such an accusation will be unjust in most instances. The  differences in conception depend to a large degree on differences in  time, and consequent fading in memory. Several other particular  conditions may be added.    Kant, e.g., calls attention to the power we have over our fancy: “In  memory, our will must control our imagination and our imagination must  be able to determine voluntarily the reproduction of ideas of past  time.”    But these ideas may be brought up not only voluntarily; we have also a  certain degree of power in making these images clearer and more  accurate. It is rather foolish to have the examiner invite the witness  to “exert his memory, to give himself the trouble, etc.” This effects  nothing, or something wrong. But if the examiner is willing to take the  trouble, he may excite the imagination of the witness and give him the  opportunity to exercise his power over the imagination. How this is done  depends naturally upon the nature and education of the witness, but the  judge may aid him just as the skilful teacher may aid the puzzled pupil  to remember. When the pianist has completely forgotten a piece of music  that he knew very well, two or three chords may lead him to explicate  these chords forward or backward, and then--one step after another--he  reproduces the whole piece. Of course the chords which are brought to  the mind of the player must be properly chosen or the procedure is  useless.    There are rules for the selection of these clews. According to  Ebbinghaus: “The difference in the content of the recollected is due to  discoverable causes. Melodies may become painful because of their  undesirable obstinacy in return. Forms and colors do not usually recur,  and if they do, they do so with noticeable claims on distinctness and  certainty. Past emotional conditions are reproduced only with effort, in  comparatively pallid schemes, and often only by means of the  accompanying movements.” We may follow these clews, in some directions  at least, to our advantage. Of course, nobody will say that one should  play tunes to witnesses in order to make them remember, because the  tunes have sunk into the memory with such undesirable obstinacy as to be  spurs to recollection. It is just as futile to operate with forms and  colors, or to excite emotional conditions. But what has been said leads  us back to the ancient rule of working so far as is possible with the  constantly well-developed sense of location. Cicero already was aware of  this: “Tanta vis admonitionis inest in locis, id quidem infinitum in hac  urbe, quocumque enim ingredimur, in aliquam historiam vestigium  possumus.” Indeed he deduces his whole doctrine of memory from the sense  of location, or he at least justifies those who do so.    If, then, we bring a witness, who in our court house recollects nothing,  in locum rei sitae, all the mentioned conditions act favorably.[221]  The most influential is the sense of location itself, inasmuch as every  point at which something significant occurred not only is the content of  an association, but is also the occasion of one. It is, moreover, to be  remembered that reproduction is a difficult task, and that all  unnecessary additional difficulties which are permitted to accrue,  definitely hinder it. Here, too, there is only a definite number of  units of psychical energy for use, and the number which must be used for  other matters is lost to the principal task. If, e.g., I recall an event  which had occurred near the window of a definite house, I should have  considerable difficulty to recall the form of the house, the location of  the window, its appearance, etc., and by the time this attempt has  barely begun to succeed, I have made so much effort that there is not  sufficient power left for the recollection of the event we are really  concerned with. Moreover, a mistake in the recollection of extraneous  objects and the false associations thereby caused, may be very  disturbing to the correctness of the memory of the chief thing. If,  however, I am on the spot, if I can see everything that I had seen at  the time in question, all these difficulties are disposed of.    We have still to count in the other conditions mentioned above. If  acoustic effects can appear anywhere, they can appear in the locality  where they first occurred. The same bell ringing, or a similar noise,  may occur accidentally, the murmur of the brook is the same, the rustle  of the wind, determined by local topography, vegetation, especially by  trees, again by buildings, varies with the place. And even if only a  fine ear can indicate what the difference consists of, every normal  individual senses that difference unconsciously. Even the “universal  noise,” which is to be found everywhere, will be differentiated and  characteristic according to locality, and that, together with all these  other things, is extraordinarily favorable to the association of ideas  and the reproduction of the past. Colors and forms are the same, similar  orders may occur, and possibly the same attitudes are awakened, since  these depend in so great degree upon external conditions. Now, once  these with their retrospective tendencies are given, the recollection of  any contemporary event increases, as one might say, spontaneously.  Whatever may especially occur to aid the memory of an event, occurs best  at the place where the event itself happened, and hence, one can not too  insistently advise the examination of witnesses, in important cases,  only in loco rei sitae. Incidentally, the judge himself learns the real  situation and saves himself, thereby, much time and effort, for he is  enabled in a few words to render the circumstantial descriptions which  have to be composed with so much difficulty when the things are not seen  and must be derived from the testimonies of the witnesses themselves.    Whoever does not believe in the importance of conducting the examination  at the place of an event, needs only to repeat his examination twice,  once at the court, and again at the place--then he certainly will doubt  no more. Of course the thing should not be so done that the event should  be discussed with the witness at the place of its occurrence and then  the protocol written in the house of the mayor, or in an inn half an  hour away--the protocol must to the very last stroke of the pen be  written then and there, in order that every impression may be renewed  and every smallest doubt studied and corrected. Then the differences  between what has passed, what has been later added, and what is found  to-day can be easily determined by sticking to the rule of Uphues, that  the recognition of the present as present is always necessary for the  eventual recognition of the past. Kant has already suggested what  surprising results such an examination will give: “There are many ideas  which we shall never again in our lives be conscious of, unless some  occasion cause them to spring up in the memory.” But such a particularly  powerful occasion is locality, inasmuch as it brings into play all the  influences which our senses are capable of responding to.[222]    Of course the possibility of artificially-stimulated memory disappears  like all memory, with the lapse of time. As a matter of fact, we know  that those of our experiences which concern particular persons and  things, and which are recalled at the sight of those persons and things,  become, later on, when the connections of images have been broken,  capable only of awakening general notions, even though the persons or  things are as absolutely present as before. But very unfavorable  circumstances must have been at work before such a situation can  develop.    It is characteristic, as is popularly known, that memory can be  intensified by means of special occasions. It is Höfler’s opinion that  the Spartan boys were whipped at the boundary stones of their country in  order that they might recall their position, and even now-a-days our  peasants have the custom, when setting up new boundary stones, of  grasping small boys by the ears and hair in order that they shall the  better remember the position of the new boundary mark when, as grown  men, they will be questioned about it. This being the case, it is safer  to believe a witness when he can demonstrate some intensely influential  event which was contemporaneous with the situation under discussion, and  which reminds him of that situation.      Section 54. (c) The Peculiarities of Reproduction.    The differences in memory which men exhibit are not, among their other  human qualities, the least. As is well known, this difference is  expressed not only in the vigor, reliability, and promptness of their  memory, but also in the field of memory, in the accompaniment of rapid  prehensivity by rapid forgetfulness, or slow prehensivity and slow  forgetfulness, or in the contrast between narrow, but intense memory,  and broad but approximate memory.    Certain special considerations arise with regard to the field of  greatest memory. As a rule, it may be presupposed that a memory which  has developed with especial vigor in one direction has generally done  this at the cost of memory in another direction. Thus, as a rule, memory  for numbers and memory for names exclude each other. My father had so  bad a memory for names that very frequently he could not quickly recall  my Christian name, and I was his own son. Frequently he had to repeat  the names of his four brothers until he hit upon mine, and that was not  always a successful way.[223] When he undertook an introduction it was  always: “My honored m--m--m,”--“The dear friend of my youth m--m--m.” On  the other hand, his memory for figures was astounding. He noted and  remembered not only figures that interested him for one reason or  another, but also those that had not the slightest connection with him,  and that he had read merely by accident. He could recall instantaneously  the population of countries and cities, and I remember that once, in the  course of an accidental conversation, he mentioned the production of  beetroot in a certain country for the last ten years, or the factory  number of my watch that he had given me fifteen years before and had  never since held in his hand. He often said that the figures he carried  in his head troubled him. In this regard the symptom may be mentioned  that he was not a good mathematician, but so exceptional a card player  that nobody wanted to play with him. He noticed every single card dealt  and could immediately calculate what cards each player had, and was able  to say at the beginning of the game how many points each must have.    Such various developments are numerous and of importance for us because  we frequently are unwilling to believe the witness testifying in a  certain field for the reason that his memory in another field had shown  itself to be unreliable. Schubert and Drobisch cite examples of this  sort of thing, but the observations of moderns, like Charcot and Binet,  concerning certain lightning calculators (Inaudi, Diamandi, etc.),  confirm the fact that the memory for figures is developed at the expense  of other matters. Linné tells that Lapps, who otherwise note nothing  whatever, are able to recognize individually each one of their  numberless reindeer. Again, the Dutch friend of flowers, Voorhelm, had a  memory only for tulips, but this was so great that he could recognize  twelve hundred species of tulips merely from the dry bulbs.    These fields seem to be of a remarkably narrow extent. Besides  specialists (numismatists, zoologists, botanists, heralds, etc.) who,  apart from their stupendous memory for their particular matters, appear  to have no memory for other things, there are people who can remember  only rhymes, melodies, shapes, forms, titles, modes, service,  relationships, etc. V. Volkmar has devoted some space to showing this.  He has also called attention to the fact that the semi-idiotic have an  astounding memory for certain things. This has been confirmed by other  students. One of them, Du Potet,[224] who is perhaps the expert in the  popular mind of the Austrian Alps, has made it especially clear. As in  all mountainous regions there are a great number of those unfortunate  idiots who, when fully developed, are called cretins, and in their  milder form are semi-human, but do not possess intelligence enough to  earn their own living. Nevertheless, many of them possess astounding  memories for certain things. One of them is thoroughly conversant with  the weather prophecy in the calendar for the past and the present year,  and can cite it for each day. Another knows the day and the history of  every saint of the Catholic church. Another knows the boundaries of  every estate, and the name, etc., of its owner. Another knows each  particular animal in a collective herd of cattle, knows to whom it  belongs, etc. Of course not one of these unfortunates can read. Drobisch  mentions an idiotic boy, not altogether able to speak, who, through the  untiring efforts of a lady, succeeded finally in learning to read. Then  after hasty reading of any piece of printed matter, he could reproduce  what he had read word for word, even when the book had been one in a  foreign and unknown tongue. Another author mentions a cretin who could  tell exactly the birthdays and death-days of the inhabitants of his town  for a decade.    It is a matter of experience that the semi-idiotic have an excellent  memory and can accurately reproduce events which are really impressive  or alarming, and which have left effects upon them. Many a thing which  normal people have barely noticed, or which they have set aside in their  memory and have forgotten, is remembered by the semi-idiotic and  reproduced. On the contrary, the latter do not remember things which  normal people do, and which in the latter frequently have a disturbing  influence on the important point they may be considering. Thus the  semi-idiotic may be able to describe important things better than normal  people. As a rule, however, they disintegrate what is to be remembered  too much, and offer too little to make any effective interpretation  possible. If such a person, e.g., is witness of a shooting, he notices  the shot only, and gives very brief attention to what precedes, what  follows, or what is otherwise contemporary. Until his examination he not  only knows nothing about it, but even doubts its occurrence. This is the  dangerous element in his testimony. Generally it is right to believe his  kind willingly. “Children and fools tell the truth,” what they say bears  the test, and so when they deny an event there is a tendency to overlook  the fact that they have forgotten a great deal and hence to believe that  the event had really not occurred.    Similar experiences are yielded in the case of the memory of children.  Children and animals live only in the present, because they have no  historically organic ideas in mind. They react directly upon stimuli,  without any disturbance of their idea of the past. This is valid,  however, only for very small children. At a later age children make good  witnesses, and a well-brought-up boy is the best witness in the world.  We have only to keep in mind that later events tend in the child’s mind  to wipe out earlier ones of the same kind.[225] It used to be said that  children and nations think only of the latest events. And that is  universally true. Just as children abandon even their most precious toys  for the sake of a new one, so they tell only the latest events in their  experience. And this is especially the case when there are a great many  facts--e.g., repeated mal-treatment or thefts, etc. Children will tell  only of the very last, the earlier one may absolutely have disappeared  from the memory.    Bolton,[226] who has made a systematic study of the memory of children,  comes to the familiar conclusion that the scope of memory is measured by  the child’s capacity of concentrating its attention. Memory and acute  intelligence are not always cognate (the latter proposition, true not  for children alone, was known to Aristotle). As a rule girls have better  memory than boys (it might also be said that their intelligence is  generally greater, so long as no continuous intellectual work, and  especially the creation of one’s own ideas, is required). Of figures  read only once, children will retain a maximum of six. (Adults, as a  rule, also retain no more.) The time of forgetting in general has been  excellently schematized by Ebbinghaus. He studied the forgetting of a  series of thirteen nonsense syllables, previously learned, in such a way  as to be able to measure the time necessary to re-learn what was  forgotten. At the end of an hour he needed half the original time, at  the end of eight hours two-thirds of that time. Then the process of loss  became slower. At the end of twenty-four hours he required a third, at  the end of six days a fourth, at the end of a month a clear fifth, of  the time required at first.    I have tested this in a rough way on various and numerous persons, and  invariably found the results to tally. Of course, the measure of time  alters with the memory in question, but the relations remain identical,  so that one may say approximately how much may be known of any subject  at the end of a fixed time, if only one ratio is tested. To criminalists  this investigation of Ebbinghaus’ is especially recommended.    The conditions of prehensivity of particular instances are too uncertain  and individual to permit any general identifications or  differentiations. There are certain approximating propositions--e.g.,  that it is easier to keep in mind rhymed verse than prose, and definite  rows and forms than block masses. But, on the one hand, what is here  involved is only the ease of memory, not the content of memory, and on  the other hand there are too many exceptions--e.g., there are many  people who retain prose better than verse. Hence, it is not worth while  to go further in the creation of such rules. Forty or fifty years ago,  investigations looking toward them had been pursued with pleasure, and  they are recorded in the journals of the time.    That aged persons have, as is well known, a good memory for what is long  past, and a poor one for recent occurrences is not remarkable. It is to  be explained by the fact that age seems to be accompanied with a  decrease of energy in the brain, so that it no longer assimilates  influences, and the imagination becomes dark and the judgment of facts  incorrect. Hence, the mistakes are those of apperception of new  things,--what has already been perceived is not influenced by this loss  of energy.    Again, it should not rouse astonishment that so remarkable and  delicately organized a function as memory should be subject to anomalies  and abnormalities of all kinds. We must take it as a rule not to assume  the impossibility of the extraordinary phenomena that appear and to  consult the expert about them.[227] The physician will explain the  pathological and pathoformic, but there is a series of memory-forms  which do not appear to be diseased, yet which are significantly rare and  hence appear improbable. Such forms will require the examination of an  experienced expert psychologist who, even when unable to explain the  particular case, will still be able to throw some light on it from the  literature of the subject. This literature is rich in examples of the  same thing; they have been eagerly collected and scientifically studied  in the earlier psychological investigations. Modern psychology,  unfortunately, does not study these problems, and in any event, its task  is so enormous that the practical problems of memory in the daily life  must be set aside for a later time. We have to cite only a few cases  handled in literature.    The best known is the story of an Irish servant girl, who, during fever,  recited Hebrew sentences which she had heard from a preacher when a  child. Another case tells of a very great fool who, during fever,  repeated prolonged conversations with his master, so that the latter  decided to make him his secretary. But when the servant got well he  became as foolish as ever. The criminalist who has the opportunity of  examining deeply wounded, feverish persons, makes similar, though not  such remarkable observations. These people give him the impression of  being quite intelligent persons who tell their stories accurately and  correctly. Later on, after they are cured, one gets a different opinion  of their intelligence. Still more frequently one observes that these  feverish, wounded victims know more, and know more correctly about the  crime than they are able to tell after they have recovered. What they  tell, moreover, is quite reliable, provided, of course, they are not  delirious or crazy.    The cases are innumerable in which people have lost their memory for a  short time, or for ever. I have already elsewhere mentioned an event  which happened to a friend of mine who received a sudden blow on the  head while in the mountains and completely lost all memory of what had  occurred a few minutes before the blow. After this citation I got a  number of letters from my colleagues who had dealt with similar cases. I  infer, therefore, that the instances in which people lose their memory  of what has occurred before the event by way of a blow on the head, are  numerous.[228]    Legally such cases are important because we would not believe statements  in that regard made by accused, inasmuch as there seems to be no reason  why the events _before_ the wound should disappear, just as if each  impression needed a fixative, like a charcoal drawing. But as this  phenomenon is described by the most reliable persons, who have no axe to  grind in the matter, we must believe it, other things being equal, even  when the defendant asserts it. That such cases are not isolated is shown  in the fact that people who have been stunned by lightning have later  forgotten everything that occurred shortly before the flash. The case is  similar in poisoning with carbonic-acid gas, with mushrooms, and in  strangulation. The latter cases are especially important, inasmuch as  the wounded person, frequently the only witness, has nothing to say  about the event.    I cannot omit recalling in this place a case I have already mentioned  elsewhere, that of Brunner. In 1893 in the town of Dietkirchen, in  Bavaria, the teacher Brunner’s two children were murdered, and his wife  and servant girl badly wounded. After some time the woman regained  consciousness, seemed to know what she was about, but could not tell the  investigating justice who had been sent on to take charge of the case,  anything whatever concerning the event, the criminal, etc. When he had  concluded his negative protocol she signed it, Martha Guttenberger,  instead of Martha Brunner. Fortunately the official noted this and  wanted to know what relation she had to the name Guttenberger. He was  told that a former lover of the servant girl, an evil-mouthed fellow,  was called by that name. He was traced to Munich and there arrested. He  immediately confessed to the crime. And when Mrs. Brunner became quite  well she recalled accurately that she had definitely recognized  Guttenberger as the murderer.[229]    The psychological process was clearly one in which the idea,  “Guttenberger is the criminal,” had sunk into the secondary sphere of  consciousness, the subconsciousness,--so that it was only clear to the  real consciousness that the name Guttenberger had something to do with  the crime. The woman in her weakened mental condition thought she had  already sufficiently indicated this fact, so that she overlooked the  name, and hence wrote it unconsciously. Only when the pressure on her  brain was reduced did the idea that Guttenberger was the murderer pass  from the subconscious to the conscious. Psychiatrists explain the case  as follows:    The thing here involved is retrograde amnesia. It is nowadays believed  that this phenomenon in the great majority of cases occurs according to  the rule which defines traumatic hysteria, i.e., as ideogen. The  ideational complexes in question are forced into the subconsciousness,  whence, on occasion, by aid of associative processes, hypnotic  concentration, and such other similar elements, they can be raised into  consciousness. In this case, the suppressed ideational complex  manifested itself in signing the name.    All legal medicine discusses the fact that wounds in the head make  people forget single words. Taine, Guerin, Abercrombie, etc., cite many  examples, and Winslow tells of a woman who, after considerable bleeding,  forgot all her French. The story is also told that Henry Holland had so  tired himself that he forgot German. When he grew stronger and recovered  he regained all he had forgotten.    _Now would we believe a prisoner who told us any one of these things?_    The phenomena of memories which occur in dying persons who have long  forgotten and never even thought of these memories, are very  significant. English psychologists cite the case of Dr. Rush, who had in  his Lutheran congregation Germans and Swedes, who prayed in their own  language shortly before death, although they had not used it for fifty  or sixty years. I can not prevent myself from thinking that many a  death-bed confession has something to do with this phenomenon.[230]    At the boundary between incorrect perception and forgetting are those  cases in which, under great excitement, important events do not reach  consciousness. I believe that the responsibility is here to be borne by  the memory rather than by sense-perception. There seems to be no reason  for failing to perceive with the senses under the greatest excitement,  but there is some clearness in the notion that great excitement causes  what has just been perceived to be almost immediately forgotten. In my  “Manual” I have discussed a series of cases of this sort, and show how  the memory might come into play. None of the witnesses, e.g., had seen  that Mary Stuart received, when being executed, two blows. In the case  of an execution of many years ago, not one of those present could tell  me the color of the gloves of the executioner, although everyone had  noticed the gloves. In a train wreck, a soldier asserted that he had  seen dozens of smashed corpses, although only one person was harmed. A  prison warden who was attacked by an escaping murderer, saw in the  latter’s hand a long knife, which turned out to be a herring. When  Carnot was murdered, neither one of the three who were in the carriage  with him, nor the two foot-men, saw the murderer’s knife or the delivery  of the blow, etc.    How often may we make mistakes because the witnesses--in their  excitement--have forgotten the most important things!      Section 55. (d) Illusions of Memory.    Memory illusion, or paramnesia, consists in the illusory opinion of  having experienced, seen, or heard something, although there has been no  such experience, vision, or sound. It is the more important in criminal  law because it enters unobtrusively and unnoticed into the circle of  observation, and not directly by means of a demonstrated mistake. Hence,  it is the more difficult to discover and has a disturbing influence  which makes it very hard to perceive the mistakes that have occurred in  consequence of it.    It may be that Leibnitz meant paramnesia with his “perceptiones  insensibiles.” Later, Lichtenberg must have had it in mind when he  repeatedly asserted that he must have been in the world once before,  inasmuch as many things seemed to him so familiar, although, at the  time, he had not yet experienced them. Later on, Jessen concerned  himself with the question, and Sander[231] asserts him to have been the  first. According to Jessen, everybody is familiar with the phenomenon in  which the sudden impression occurs, that what is experienced has  already been met with before so that the future might be predicted.  Langwieser asserts that one always has the sensation that the event  occurred a long time ago, and Dr. Karl Neuhoff finds that his sensation  is accompanied with unrest and contraction. The same thing is discussed  by many other authors.[232]    Various explanations have been offered. Wigand and Maudsley think they  see in paramnesia a simultaneous functioning of both relations. Anje  believes that illusory memory depends on the differentiation which  sometimes occurs between perception and coming-into-consciousness.  According to Külpe, these are the things that Plato interpreted in his  doctrine of pre-existence.    Sully,[233] in his book on illusions, has examined the problem most  thoroughly and he draws simple conclusions. He finds that vivacious  children often think they have experienced what is told them. This,  however, is retained in the memory of the adult, who continues to think  that he has actually experienced it. The same thing is true when  children have intensely desired anything. Thus the child-stories given  us by Rousseau, Goethe, and De Quincey, must come from the airy regions  of the dream life or from waking revery, and Dickens has dealt with this  dream life in “David Copperfield.” Sully adds, that we also generate  illusions of memory when we assign to experiences false dates, and  believe ourselves to have felt, as children, something we experienced  later and merely set back into our childhood.    So again, he reduces much supposed to have been heard, to things that  have been read. Novels may make such an impression that what has been  read or described there appears to have been really experienced. A name  or region then seems to be familiar because we have read of something  similar.    It will perhaps be proper not to reduce all the phenomena of paramnesia  to the same conditions. Only a limited number of them seem to be so  reducible. Impressions often occur which one is inclined to attribute to  illusory memory, merely to discover later that they were real but  unconscious memory; the things had been actually experienced and the  events had been forgotten. So, for example, I visit some region for the  first time and get the impression that I have seen it before, and since  this, as a matter of fact, is not the case, I believe myself to have  suffered from an illusion of memory. Later, I perceive that perhaps in  early childhood I had really been in a country that resembled this one.  Thus my memory was really correct; I had merely forgotten the experience  to which it referred.    Aside from these unreal illusions of memory, many, if not all others,  are explicable, as Sully indicates, by the fact that something similar  to what has been experienced, has been read or heard, while the fact  that it has been read or heard is half forgotten or has sunk into the  subconsciousness. Only the sensation has remained, not the recollection  that it was read, etc. Another part of this phenomenon may possibly be  explained by vivid dreams, which also leave strong impressions without  leaving the memory of their having been dreams. Whoever is in the habit  of dreaming vividly will know how it is possible to have for days a  clear or cloudy feeling of the discovery of something excellent or  disturbing, only to find out later that there has been no real  experience, only a dream. Such a feeling, especially the memory of  things seen or heard in dreams, may remain in consciousness. If, later,  some similar matter is really met with, the sensation may appear as a  past event.[234] This is all the easier since dreams are never  completely rigid, but easily modeled and adaptable, so that if there is  the slightest approximation to similarity, memory of a dream lightly  attaches itself to real experience.    All this may happen to anybody, well or ill, nervous or stolid. Indeed,  Kräpelin asserts that paramnesia occurs only under normal circumstances.  It may also be generally assumed that a certain fatigued condition of  the mind or of the body renders this occurrence more likely, if it does  not altogether determine it. So far as self-observation throws any light  on the matter, this statement appears to be correct. I had such  illusions of memory most numerously during the Bosnian war of occupation  of 1878, when we made our terrible forced marches from Esseg to  Sarajevo. The illusions appeared regularly after dinner, when we were  quite tired. Then the region which all my preceding life I had not seen,  appeared to be pleasantly familiar, and when once, at the very  beginning, I received the order to storm a village occupied by Turks, I  thought it would not be much trouble, I had done it so frequently and  nothing had ever happened. At that time we were quite exhausted. Even  when we had entered the otherwise empty village this extraordinary  circumstance did not impress me, and I thought that the inside of a  village always looked like that--although I had never before seen such a  Turkish street-hotel “in natura” or pictured.    Another mode of explanation may be mentioned, i.e., explanation by  heredity. Hering[235] and Sully have dealt with it. According to the  latter, especially, we may think that we have undergone some experience  that really belongs to some ancestor. Sully believes that this  contention can not be genetically contradicted because a group of  skilled activities (nest-building, food-seeking, hiding from the enemy,  migration, etc.) have been indubitably inherited from the animals, but  on the other hand, that paramnesia is inherited memory can be proved  only with, e.g., a child which had been brought up far from the sea but  whose parents and grandparents had been coast-dwellers. If that child  should at first sight have the feeling that he is familiar with the sea,  the inheritance of memory would be proved. So long as we have not a  larger number of such instances the assumption of hereditary influence  is very suggestive but only probable.    With regard to the bearing of memory-illusions on criminal cases I shall  cite only one possible instance. Somebody just waking from sleep has  perceived that his servant is handling his purse which is lying on the  night-table, and in consequence of the memory-illusion he believes that  he has already observed this many times before. The action of the  servant was perhaps harmless and in no way directed toward theft. Now  the evidence of the master is supposed to demonstrate that this has  repeatedly occurred, then perhaps no doubt arises that the servant has  committed theft frequently and has had the intention of doing so this  time.    To generalize this situation would be to indicate that illusions of  memory are always likely to have doubtful results when they have  occurred only once and when the witness in consequence of paramnesia  believes the event to have been repeatedly observed. It is not difficult  to think of numbers of such cases but it will hardly be possible to say  how the presence of illusions of memory is to be discovered without the  knowledge _that_ they exist.           *       *       *       *       *    When we consider all the qualities and idiosyncrasies of memory, this so  varied function of the mind, we must wonder that its estimation in  special cases is frequently different, although proceeding from a second  person or from the very owner of the questionable memory. Sully finds  rightly, that one of the keenest tricks in fighting deep-rooted  convictions is to attack the memory of another with regard to its  reliability. Memory is the private domain of the individual. From the  secret council-chamber of his own consciousness, into which no other may  enter, it draws all its values.    The case is altered, however, when a man speaks of his personal memory.  It must then assume all the deficiencies which belong to other mental  powers. We lawyers, especially, hear frequently from witnesses: “My  memory is too weak to answer this question,” “Since receiving the wound  in question my memory has failed,” “I am already too old, my memory is  leaving me,” etc. In each of these cases, however, it is not the memory  that is at fault. As a matter of fact the witness ought to have said “I  am too stupid to answer this question,” “Since the wound in question, my  intellectual powers have failed,” “I am already old, I am growing  silly,” etc. But of course no one will, save very rarely, underestimate  his good sense, and it is more comfortable to assign its deficiencies to  the memory. This occurs not only in words but also in construction. If a  man has incorrectly reproduced any matter, whether a false observation,  or a deficient combination, or an unskilled interpretation of facts, he  will not blame these things but will assign the fault to memory. If he  is believed, absolutely incorrect conclusions may result.      Section 56. (e) Mnemotechnique.    Just a few words concerning mnemotechnique, mnemonic, and anamnestic.  The discovery of some means of helping the memory has long been a human  purpose. From Simonides of Chios, to the Sophist Hippias of Elis,  experiments have been made in artificial development of the memory, and  some have been remarkably successful. Since the middle ages a large  group of people have done this. We still have the figures of the valid  syllogisms in logic, like Barbara, etc. The rules for remembering in the  Latin grammar, etc., may still be learned with advantage. The books of  Kothe and others, have, in their day, created not a little discussion.    As a rule, modern psychology pays a little attention to memory devices.  In a certain sense, nobody can avoid mnemonic, for whenever you tie a  knot in your handkerchief, or stick your watch into your pocket upside  down, you use a memory device. Again, whenever you want to bear anything  in mind you reduce difficulties and bring some kind of order into what  you are trying to retain.    Thus, some artificial grip on the object is applied by everybody, and  the utility and reliability of this grip determines the trustworthiness  of a man’s memory. This fact may be important for the criminal lawyer in  two ways. On the one hand, it may help to clear up misunderstandings  when false mnemonic has been applied. Thus, once somebody called an  aniline dye, which is soluble in water and is called “nigrosin,” by the  name “moorosin,” and asked for it under that name in the store. In order  to aid his memory he had associated it with the word for black man =  niger = negro = moor, and thus had substituted moor for nigro in the  construction of the word he wanted. Again, somebody asked for the “Duke  Salm” or the “Duke Schmier.” The request was due to the fact that in the  Austrian dialect _salve_ is pronounced like salm and the colloquial for  “salm” is “schmier” (to wipe). Dr. Ernst Lohsing tells me that he was  once informed that a Mr. Schnepfe had called on him, while, as a matter  of fact the gentleman’s name was Wachtel. Such misunderstandings,  produced by false mnemonic, may easily occur during the examination of  witnesses. They are of profound significance. If once you suspect that  false memory has been in play, you may arrive at the correct idea by  using the proper synonyms and by considering similarly-pronounced words.  If attention is paid to the determining conditions of the special case,  success is almost inevitable.    The second way in which false mnemotechnique is important is that in  which the technique was correct, but in which the key to the system has  been lost, i.e., the witness has forgotten how he proceeded. Suppose,  for example, that I need to recall the relation of the ages of three  people to each other. Now, if I observe that M is the oldest, N the  middle one, and O the youngest, I may suppose, in order to help my  memory, that their births followed in the same order as their initials,  M, N, O. Now suppose that at another time, in another case I observe the  same relation but find the order of the initials reversed O, N, M. If  now, in the face of the facts, I stop simply with this technique, I may  later on substitute the two cases for each other. Hence, when a witness  says anything which appears to have been difficult to remember, it is  necessary to ask him _how_ he was able to remember it. If he assigns  some aid to memory as the reason, he must be required to explain it, and  he must not be believed unless it is found reliable. If the witness in  the instance above, for example, says, “I never make use of converse  relations,” then his testimony will seem comparatively trustworthy. And  it is not difficult to judge the degree of reliability of any aid to  memory whatever.    Great liars are frequently characterized by their easy use of the most  complicated mnemotechnique. They know how much they need it.      Topic 7. THE WILL.      Section 57.    Of course, we do not intend to discuss here either the “will” of the  philosopher, or the “malice” or “ill-will” of criminal law, nor yet the  “freedom of the will” of the moralist. We aim only to consider a few  facts that may be of significance to the criminal lawyer. Hence, we  intend by “will” only what is currently and popularly meant. I take will  to be the inner effect of the more powerful impulses, while action is  the _external_ effect of those impulses. When Hartmann says that will is  the transposition of the ideal into the real, he sounds foolish, but in  one sense the definition is excellent. You need only understand by ideal  that which does not yet exist, and by real that which is a fact and  actual. For when I voluntarily compel myself to think about some  subject, something has actually happened, but this event is not “real”  in the ordinary sense of that word. We are to bear in mind, however,  that Locke warned us against the contrast between intelligence and will,  as real, spiritual essences, one of which gives orders and the other of  which obeys. From this conception many fruitless controversies and  confusions have arisen. In this regard, we criminalists must always  remember how often the common work of will and intelligence opposes us  in witnesses and still more so in defendants, causing us great  difficulties. When the latter deny their crime with iron fortitude and  conceal their guilt by rage, or when for months they act out most  difficult parts with wonderful energy, we must grant that they exhibit  aspects of the will which have not yet been studied. Indeed, we can make  surprising observations of how effectively prisoners control the muscles  of their faces, which are least controllable by the will. The influence  the will may have on a witness’s power even to flush and grow pale is  also more extensive than may be established scientifically. This can be  learned from quite remote events. My son happens to have told me that at  one time he found himself growing pale with cold, and as under the  circumstance he was afraid of being accused of lacking courage to pursue  his task, he tried with all his power to suppress his pallor, and  succeeded perfectly. Since then, at court, I have seen a rising blush or  beginning pallor suppressed completely; yet this is theoretically  impossible.    But the will is also significant in judging the man as a whole.  According to Drobisch,[236] the abiding qualities and ruling “set” of a  man’s volition constitute his character. Not only inclination, and  habits, and guiding principles determine the character, but also  meanings, prejudices, convictions, etc. of all kinds. Since, then, we  can not avoid studying the character of the individual, we must trace  his volitions and desires. This in itself is not difficult; the idea of  his character develops spontaneously when so traced. But the will  contains also the characteristic signs of difference which are important  for our purposes. We are enabled to work intelligently and clearly only  by our capacity for distinguishing indifferent, from criminal and  logically interpretable deeds. Nothing makes our work so difficult as  the inconceivably superfluous mass of details. Not every deed or  activity is an action; only those are such which are determined by will  and knowledge. So Abegg[237] teaches us, what is determined by means of  the will may be discovered by analysis.    Of course, we must find the proper approach to this subject and not get  lost in the libertarian-deterministic quarrel, which is the  turning-point in contemporary criminal law. Forty years ago Renan said  that the error of the eighteenth century lay generally in assigning to  the free and self-conscious will what could be explained by means of the  natural effects of human powers and capacities. That century understood  too little the theory of instinctive activity. Nobody will claim that in  the transposition of willing into the expression of human capacity, the  question of determinism is solved. The solution of this question is not  our task. We do get an opening however through which we can approach the  criminal,--not by having to examine the elusive character of his will,  but by apprehending the intelligible expression of his capacity. The  weight of our work is set on the application of the concept of  causality, and the problem of free-will stands or falls with that.    Bois-Reymond in his “Limits of the Knowledge of Nature” has brought some  clearness into this problem: “Freedom may be denied, pain and desire may  not; the appetite which is the stimulus to action necessarily precedes  sense-perception. The problem, therefore, is that of sense-perception,  and not as I had said a minute ago, that of the freedom of the will. It  is to the former that analytic mechanics may be applied.” And the study  of sense-perception is just what we lawyers may be required to  undertake.    Of course, it is insufficient merely to study the individual  manifestations of human capacities, for these may be accidental results  or phenomena, determined by unknown factors. Our task consists in  attaining abstractions in accord with careful and conscientious  perceptions, and in finding each determining occasion in its particular  activities.    According to Drobisch, “maxims and the subjective principles of  evolution are, as Kant calls them, laws of general content required to  determine our own volitions and actions. Then again, they are rules of  our own volition and action which we ourselves construct, and which  hence are subjectively valid. When these maxims determine our future  volitions and actions they are postulates.” We may, therefore, say that  we know a man when we know his will, and that we know his will when we  know his maxims. By means of his maxims we are able to judge his  actions.    But we must not reconstruct his maxims theoretically. We must study  everything that surrounds, alters, and determines him, for it is at this  point that a man’s environments and relationships most influence him. As  Grohmann said, half a century ago, “If you could find an elixir, which  could cause the vital organs to work otherwise, if you could alter the  somatic functions of the body, you would be the master of the will.”  Therefore it is never superfluous to study the individual’s  environmental conditions, surroundings, all his outer influences. That  the effort required in such a study is great, is of course obvious, but  the criminal lawyer must make it if he is to perform his task  properly.[238]      Topic 8. EMOTION.      Section 58.    Little as emotion, as generally understood, may have to do with the  criminalist, it is, in its intention, most important for him. The motive  of a series of phenomena and events, both in prisoners and witnesses, is  emotion. In what follows, therefore, we shall attempt to show that  feeling, in so far as we need to consider it, need not be taken as an  especial function. This is only so far significant as to make our work  easier by limiting it to fewer subjects. If we can reduce some one  psychic function to another category we can explain many a thing even  when we know only the latter. In any event, the study of a single  category is simpler than that of many.[239]    Abstractly, the word emotion is the property or capacity of the mind to  be influenced pleasantly or unpleasantly by sensations, perceptions, and  ideas. Concretely, it means the conditions of desire or disgust which  are developed by the complex of conditions thereby aroused. We have  first to distinguish between the so-called animal and the higher  emotions. We will assume that this distinction is incorrect, inasmuch as  between these classes there is a series of feelings which may be counted  as well with one as with the other, so that the transition is incidental  and no strict differentiation is possible. We will, however, retain the  distinction, as it is easier by means of it to pass from the simpler to  the more difficult emotions. The indubitably animal passions we shall  take to be hunger, thirst, cold, etc. These are first of all purely  physiological stimuli which act on our body. But it is impossible to  imagine one of them, without, at the same time, inevitably bringing in  the idea of the defense against this physiological stimulus. It is  impossible to think of the feeling of hunger without sensing also the  strain to find relief from this feeling, for without this sensation  hunger would not appear as such. If I am hungry I go for food; if I am  cold I seek for warmth; if I feel pain I try to wipe it out. How to  satisfy these desiderative actions is a problem for the understanding,  whence it follows that successful satisfaction, intelligent or  unintelligent, may vary in every possible degree. We see that the least  intelligent--real cretins--sometimes are unable to satisfy their hunger,  for when food is given the worst of them, they stuff it, in spite of  acute sensations of hunger, into their ears and noses, but not into  their mouths. We must therefore say that there is always a demand for a  minimum quantity of intelligence in order to know that the feeling of  hunger may be vanquished by putting food into the mouth.    One step further: In the description of the conduct of anthropoid apes  which are kept in menageries, etc., especial intelligence is assigned to  those who know how to draw a blanket over themselves as protection  against cold. The same action is held to be a sign of intelligence in  very young children.    Still more thoroughly graded is the attitude toward pain, inasmuch as  barely a trace of intelligence is required, in order to know that it is  necessary to wipe away a hot liquid drop that has fallen on the body.  Every physiological text-book mentions the fact that a decapitated frog  makes such wiping movements when it is wet with acid. From this  unconscious activity of the understanding to the technically  highest-developed treatment of a burn, a whole series of progressively  higher expressions of intelligence may be interpolated, a series so  great as to defy counting.    Now take another, still animal, but more highly-developed feeling, for  example, the feeling of comfort. We lay a cat on a soft bolster--she  stretches herself, spreads and thins herself out, in order to bring as  many nerve termini as possible into contact with the pleasant stimuli of  the bolster. This behavior of the cat may be construed as instinctive,  also as the aboriginal source of the sense of comfort and as leading to  luxury in comfort, the stage of comfort which Roscher calls highest. (I.  Luxury in eating and drinking. II. Luxury in dress. III. Luxury in  comfort.)    Therefore we may say that the reaction of the understanding to the  physiological stimulus aims to set it aside when it is unpleasant, and  to increase and exhaust it when it is pleasant, and that in a certain  sense both coincide (the ousting of unpleasant darkness is equivalent to  the introduction of pleasant light). We may therefore say generally,  that feeling is a physiological stimulus indivisibly connected with the  understanding’s sensitive attitude thereto. Of course there is a far cry  from instinctive exclusion and inclusion to the most refined defensive  preparation or interpretation, but the differences which lie next to  each, on either side, are only differences in degree.    Now let us think of some so-called higher feeling and consider a special  case of it. I meet for the first time a man who is unpleasantly marked,  e.g., with badly colored hair. This stimulates my eyes disagreeably, and  I seek either by looking away or by wishing the man away to protect  myself from this physiologically-inimical influence, which already  eliminates all feeling of friendship for this harmless individual. Now I  see that the man is torturing an animal,--I do not like to see this, it  affects me painfully; hence I wish him out of the way still more  energetically. If he goes on so, adding one disagreeable characteristic  to another, I might break his bones to stop him, bind him in chains to  hinder him; I even might kill him, to save myself the unpleasant  excitation he causes me. I strain my intelligence to think of some means  of opposing him, and clearly, in this case, also, physiological  stimulus and activity of the understanding are invincibly united.    The emotion of anger is rather more difficult to explain. But it is not  like suddenly-exploding hatred, for it is acute, while hatred is  chronic. I might be angry with my beloved child. But though at the  moment of anger, the expression is identical with that of hatred, it is  also transitive. In the extremest cases the negating action aims to  destroy the stimulus. This is the most radical means of avoiding  physiological excitation, and hence I tear in pieces a disagreeable  letter, or stamp to powder the object on which I have hurt myself. Where  persons are involved, I proceed either directly or symbolically when I  can not, or may not, get my hands on the responsible one.    The case is the same with feeling of attraction. I own a dog, he has  beautiful lines which are pleasant to my eye, he has a bell-like bark  that stimulates my ear pleasantly, he has a soft coat which is pleasant  to my stroking hand, I know that in case of need the dog will protect me  (and that is a calming consideration), I know that he may be otherwise  of use to me--in short my understanding tells me all kinds of pleasant  things about the beast. Hence I like to have him near me; i.e., I like  him. The same explanation may be applied to all emotions of inclination  or repulsion. Everywhere we find the emotion as physiological stimulus  in indivisible union with a number of partly known, partly unknown  functions of the understanding. The unknown play an important rôle. They  are serial understandings, i.e., inherited from remote ancestors, and  are characterized by the fact that they lead us to do the things we do  when we recognize intelligently any event and its requirements.    When one gets thirsty, he drinks. Cattle do the same. And they drink  even when nobody has told them to, because this is an inherited action  of countless years. If a man is, however, to proceed intelligently about  his drinking, he will say, “By drying, or other forms of segregation,  the water will be drawn from the cells of my body, they will become  arid, and will no longer be sufficiently elastic to do their work. If,  now, by way of my stomach, through endosmosis and exosmosis, I get them  more water, the proper conditions will return.” The consequences of this  form of consideration will not be different from the instinctive action  of the most elementary of animals--the wise man and the animal drink. So  the whole content of every emotion is physiological stimulation and  function of the understanding.    And what good is all this to the criminal lawyer? Nobody doubts that  both prisoners and witnesses are subject to the powerful influence of  emotional expression. Nobody doubts that the determination,  interpretation, and judgment of these expressions are as difficult as  they are important to the judge. And when we consider these emotions as  especial conditions of the mind it is indubitable that they are able to  cause still greater difficulty because of their elusiveness, their very  various intensity, and their confused effect. Once, however, we think of  them as functions of the understanding, we have, in its activities,  something better known, something rather more disciplined, which offers  very many fewer difficulties in the judgment concerning the fixed form  in which it acts. Hence, every judgment of an emotional state must be  preceded by a reconstruction in terms of the implied functions of the  understanding. Once this is done, further treatment is no longer  difficult.      Topic 9. THE FORMS OF GIVING TESTIMONY.      Section 59.    Wherever we turn we face the absolute importance of language for our  work. Whatever we hear or read concerning a crime is expressed in words,  and everything perceived with the eye, or any other sense, must be  clothed in words before it can be put to use. That the criminalist must  know this first and most important means of understanding, completely  and in all its refinements, is self-evident. But still more is required  of him. He must first of all undertake a careful investigation of the  essence of language itself. A glance over literature shows how the  earliest scholars have aimed to study language with regard to its  origins and character. Yet, who needs this knowledge? The lawyer. Other  disciplines can find in it only a scientific interest, but it is  practically and absolutely valuable only for us lawyers, who must, by  means of language, take evidence, remember it, and variously interpret  it. A failure in a proper understanding of language may give rise to  false conceptions and the most serious of mistakes. Hence, nobody is so  bound as the criminal lawyer to study the general character of language,  and to familiarize himself with its force, nature, and development.  Without this knowledge the lawyer may be able to make use of language,  but failing to understand it, will slip up before the slightest  difficulty. There is an exceedingly rich literature open to  everybody.[240]      Section 60. (a) General Study of Variety in Forms of Expression.    Men being different in nature and bringing-up on the one hand, and  language, being on the other, a living organism which varies with its  soil, i.e., with the human individual who makes use of it, it is  inevitable that each man should have especial and private forms of  expression. These forms, if the man comes before us as witness or  prisoner, we must study, each by itself. Fortunately, this study must be  combined with another that it implies, i.e., the character and nature of  the individual. The one without the other is unthinkable. Whoever aims  to study a man’s character must first of all attend to his ways of  expression, inasmuch as these are most significant of a man’s qualities,  and most illuminating. A man is as he speaks. It is not possible, on the  other hand, to study modes of expression in themselves. Their  observation requires the study of a group of other conditions, if the  form of speech is to be explained, or its analysis made even possible.  Thus, one is involved in the other, and once you know clearly the tricks  of speech belonging to an individual, you also have a clear conception  of his character and conversely. This study requires, no doubt,  considerable skill. But that is at the command of anybody who is devoted  to the lawyer’s task.    Tylor is correct in his assertion, that a man’s speech indicates his  origin much less than his bringing-up, his education, and his power.  Much of this fact is due to the nature of language as a living growth  and moving organism which acquires new and especial forms to express new  and especial events in human life. Geiger[241] cites the following  example of such changes in the meaning of words. “Mriga” means in  Sanscrit, “wild beast;” in Zend it means merely “bird,” and the  equivalent Persian term “mrug” continues to mean only “bird,” so that  the barnyard fowls, song-birds, etc., are now called “mrug.” Thus the  first meaning, “wild animal” has been transmuted into its opposite,  “tame animal.” In other cases we may incorrectly suppose certain  expressions to stand for certain things. We say, “to bake bread, to bake  cake, to bake certain meats,” and then again, “to roast apples, to roast  potatoes, to roast certain meats.” We should laugh if some foreigner  told us that he had “roasted” bread.    These forms of expression have, as yet, no relation to character, but  they are the starting-point of quite characteristic modes which  establish themselves in all corporations, groups, classes, such as  students, soldiers, hunters, etc., as well as among the middle classes  in large cities. Forms of this kind may become so significant that the  use of a single one of them might put the user in question into  jeopardy. I once saw two old gentlemen on a train who did not know each  other. They fell into conversation and one told the other that he had  seen an officer, while jumping from his horse, trip over his sword and  fall. But instead of the word sword he made use of the old  couleur-student slang word “speer,” and the other old boy looked at him  with shining eyes and cried out “Well, brother, what color?”    Still more remarkable is the mutation and addition of new words of  especially definite meaning among certain classes. The words become more  modern, like so much slang.    The especial use of certain forms is individual as well as social. Every  person has his private usage. One makes use of “certainly,” another of  “yes, indeed,” one prefers “dark,” another “darkish.” This fact has a  double significance. Sometimes a man’s giving a word a definite meaning  may explain his whole nature. How heartless and raw is the statement of  a doctor who is telling about a painful operation, “The patient sang!”  In addition, it is frequently necessary to investigate the connotation  people like to give certain words, otherwise misunderstandings are  inevitable. This investigation is, as a rule, not easy, for even when it  is simple to bring out what is intended by an expression, it is still  quite as simple to overlook the fact that people use peculiar  expressions for ordinary things. This occurs particularly when people  are led astray by the substitution of similars and by the repetition of  such a substitution. Very few persons are able to distinguish between  identity and similarity; most of them take these two characters to be  equivalent. If A and B are otherwise identical, save that B is a little  bigger, so that they appear similar, there is no great mistake if I hold  them to be equivalent and substitute B for A. Now I compare B with C, C  with D, D with E, etc., and each member of the series is progressively  bigger than its predecessor. If now I continue to repeat my first  mistake, I have in the end substituted for A the enormously bigger E and  the mistake has become a very notable one. I certainly would not have  substituted E for A at the beginning, but the repeated substitution of  similars has led me to this complete incommensurability.    Such substitutions occur frequently during the alterations of meanings,  and if you wish to see how some remarkable signification of a term has  arisen you will generally find it as a progression through gradually  remoter similarities to complete dissimilarity. All such extraordinary  alterations which a word has undergone in the course of long usage, and  for which each linguistic text-book contains numerous examples, may,  however, develop with comparative speed in each individual speaker, and  if the development is not traced may lead, in the law-court, to very  serious misunderstandings.    Substitutions, and hence, sudden alterations, occur when the material of  language, especially in primitive tongues, contains only simple  differentiations. So Tylor mentions the fact, that the language of the  West African Wolofs contains the word “da_goú_,” to go, “_dá_gou,” to  stride proudly; “dágana,” to beg dejectedly; “dagána,” to demand. The  Mpongwes say, “mì tonda,” I love, and “mi tônda,” I do not love. Such  differentiations in tone our own people make also, and the mutation of  meaning is very close. But who observes it at all?    Important as are the changes in the meanings of words, they fall short  beside the changes of meaning of the conception given in the mode of  exposition. Hence, there are still greater mistakes, because a single  error is neither easily noticeable nor traceable. J. S. Mill says,  justly, that the ancient scientists missed a great deal because they  were guided by linguistic classification. It scarcely occurred to them  that what they assigned abstract names to really consisted of several  phenomena. Nevertheless, the mistake has been inherited, and people who  nowadays name abstract things, conceive, according to their  intelligence, now this and now that phenomenon by means of it. Then they  wonder at the other fellow’s not understanding them. The situation being  so, the criminalist is coercively required, whenever anything abstract  is named, first of all to determine accurately what the interlocutor  means by his word. In these cases we make the curious discovery that  such determination is most necessary among people who have studied the  object profoundly, for a technical language arises with just the persons  who have dealt especially with any one subject.    As a rule it must be maintained that time, even a little time, makes an  essential difference in the conception of any object. Mittermaier, and  indeed Bentham, have shown what an influence the interval between  observation and announcement exercises on the form of exposition. The  witness who is immediately examined may, perhaps, say the same thing  that he would say several weeks after--but his presentation is  different, he uses different words, he understands by the different  words different concepts, and so his testimony becomes altered.    A similar effect may be brought about by the conditions under which the  evidence is given. Every one of us knows what surprising differences  occur between the statements of the witness made in the silent office of  the examining justice and his secretary, and what he says in the open  trial before the jury. There is frequently an inclination to attack  angrily the witnesses who make such divergent statements. Yet more  accurate observation would show that the testimony is essentially the  same as the former but that the manner of giving it is different, and  hence the apparently different story. The difference between the members  of the audience has a powerful influence. It is generally true that  reproductive construction is intensified by the sight of a larger number  of attentive hearers, but this is not without exception. In the words  “attentive hearers” there is the notion that the speaker is speaking  interestingly and well, for otherwise his hearers would not be  attentive, and if anything is well done and is known to be well done,  the number of the listeners is exciting, inasmuch as each listener is  reckoned as a stimulating admirer. This is invariably the case. If  anybody is doing a piece of work under observation he will feel pleasant  when he knows that he is doing it well, but he will feel disturbed and  troubled if he is certain of his lack of skill. So we may grant that a  large number of listeners increases reproductive constructivity, but  only when the speaker is certain of his subject and of the favor of his  auditors. Of the latter, strained attention is not always evidence. When  a scholar is speaking of some subject chosen by himself, and his  audience listens to him attentively, he has chosen his subject  fortunately, and speaks well; the attention acts as a spur, he speaks  still better, etc. But this changes when, in the course of a great trial  which excites general interest, the witness for the government appears.  Strained attention will also be the rule, but it does not apply to him,  it applies to the subject. He has not chosen his topic, and no  recognition for it is due him--it is indifferent to him whether he  speaks ill or well. The interest belongs only to the subject, and the  speaker himself receives, perhaps, the undivided antipathy, hatred,  disgust, or scorn, of all the listeners. Nevertheless, attention is  intense and strained, and inasmuch as the speaker knows that this does  not pertain to him or his merits, it confuses and depresses him. It is  for this reason that so many criminal trials turn out quite contrary to  expectation. Those who have seen the trial only, and were not at the  prior examination, understand the result still less when they are told  that “nothing” has altered since the prior examination--and yet much has  altered; the witnesses, excited or frightened by the crowd of listeners,  have spoken and expressed themselves otherwise than before until, in  this manner, the whole case has become different.    In a similar fashion, some fact may be shown in another light by the  manner of narration used by a particular witness. Take, as example, some  energetically influential quality like humor. It is self-evident that  joke, witticism, comedy, are excluded from the court-room, but if  somebody has actually introduced real, genuine humor by way of the dry  form of his testimony, without having crossed in a single word the  permissible limit, he may, not rarely, narrate a very serious story so  as to reduce its dangerous aspect to a minimum. Frequently the testimony  of some funny witness makes the rounds of all the newspapers for the  pleasure of their readers. Everybody knows how a really humorous person  may so narrate experiences, doubtful situations of his student days,  unpleasant traveling experiences, difficult positions in quarrels, etc.,  that every listener must laugh. At the same time, the events told of  were troublesome, difficult, even quite dangerous. The narrator does not  in the least lie, but he manages to give his story the twist that even  the victim of the situation is glad to laugh at.[242] As Kräpelin says,  “The task of humor is to rob a large portion of human misfortune of its  wounding power. It does so by presenting to us, with our fellows as  samples, the comedy of the innumerable stupidities of human life.”    Now suppose that a really humorous witness tells a story which involves  very considerable consequences, but which he does not really end with  tragic conclusions. Suppose the subject to be a great brawl, some really  crass deception, some story of an attack on honor, etc. The attitude  toward the event is altered with one turn, even though it would seem to  have been generated progressively by ten preceding witnesses and the new  view of the matter makes itself valid at least mildly in the delivery of  the sentence. Then whoever has not heard the whole story understands the  results least of all.    In the same way we see really harmless events turned into tragedies by  the testimony of a black-visioned, melancholy witness, without his  having used, in this case or any other, a single untrue word. In like  manner the bitterness of a witness who considers his personal  experiences to be generally true, may color and determine the attitude  of some, not at all serious, event. Nor is this exaggeration. Every man  of experience will, if he is only honest enough, confirm the fact, and  grant that he himself was among those whose attitude has been so  altered; I avoid the expression--“duped.”    It is necessary here, also, to repeat that the movements of the hands  and other gestures of the witnesses while making their statements will  help much to keep the correct balance. Movements lie much less  frequently than words.[243]    Another means of discovering whether a witness is not seduced by his  attitude and his own qualities is the careful observation of the  impression his narrative makes on himself. Stricker has controlled the  conditions of speech and has observed that so long as he continued to  bring clearly described complexes into a causal relation, _satisfactory  to him_, he could excite his auditors; as soon as he spoke of a relation  which _did not_ satisfy him the attitude of the audience altered. We  must invert this observation; we are the auditors of the witness and  must observe whether his own causal connections satisfy him. So long as  this is the case, we believe him. When it fails to be so he is either  lying, or he himself knows that he is not expressing himself as he ought  to make us correctly understand what he is talking about.      Section 61. (b) Dialect Forms.    What every criminal lawyer must unconditionally know is the dialect of  those people he has most to deal with. This is so important that I  should hold it conscienceless to engage in the profession of criminology  without knowing the dialects. Nobody with experience would dispute my  assertion that nothing is the cause of so great and so serious  misunderstandings, of even inversions of justice, as ignorance of  dialects, ignorance of the manner of expression of human groups. Wrongs  so caused can never be rectified because their primary falsehood starts  in the protocol, where no denial, no dispute and redefinition can change  them.    It is no great difficulty to learn dialects, if only one is not seduced  by comic pride and foolish ignorance of his own advantage into believing  that popular speech is something low or common. Dialect has as many  rights as literary language, is as living and interesting an organism as  the most developed form of expression. Once the interest in dialect is  awakened, all that is required is the learning of a number of meanings.  Otherwise, there are no difficulties, for the form of speech of the real  peasant (and this is true all over the world), is always the simplest,  the most natural, and the briefest. Tricks, difficult construction,  circumlocutions are unknown to the peasant, and if he is only left to  himself he makes everything definite, clear, and easily intelligible.    There are many more difficulties in the forms of expression of the  uncultivated city man, who has snapped up a number of uncomprehended  phrases and tries to make use of them because of their suppositious  beauty, regardless of their fitness. Unpleasant as it is to hear such a  screwed and twisted series of phrases, without beginning and without  end, it is equally difficult to get a clear notion of what the man  wanted to say, and especially whether the phrases used were really  brought out with some purpose or simply for the sake of showing off,  because they sound “educated.”    In this direction nothing is more significant than the use of the  imperfect in countries where its use is not customary and where as a  rule only the perfect is used; not “I was going,” but “I have gone”  (went). In part the reading of newspapers, but partly also the  unfortunate habit of our school teachers, compel children to the use of  the imperfect, which has not an iota more justification than the  perfect, and which people make use of under certain circumstances, i.e.,  when they are talking to educated people, and then only before they have  reached a certain age.    I confess that I regularly mistrust a witness who makes use of an  imperfect or some other form not habitual to him. I presuppose that he  is a weak-minded person who has allowed himself to be persuaded; I  believe that he is not altogether reliable because he permits untrue  forms to express his meaning, and I fear that he neglects the content  for the sake of the form. The simple person who quietly and without  shame makes use of his natural dialect, supplies no ground for mistrust.    There are a few traits of usage which must always be watched. First of  all, all dialects are in certain directions poorer than the literary  language. E. g., they make use of fewer colors. The blue grape, the red  wine, may be indicated by the word black, the light wine by the word  white. Literary language has adopted the last term from dialect. Nobody  says water-colored or yellow wine, although nobody has ever yet seen  white wine. Similarly, no peasant says a “brown dog,” a “brown-yellow  cow”--these colors are always denoted by the word red. This is important  in the description of clothes. There is, however, no contradiction  between this trait and the fact that the dialect may be rich in terms  denoting objects that may be very useful, e.g. the handle of a tool may  be called handle, grasp, haft, stick, clasp, etc.    When foreign words are used it is necessary to observe in what tendency,  and what meaning their adoption embodies.[244]    The great difficulty of getting uneducated people to give their  testimony in direct discourse is remarkable. You might ask for the words  of the speaker ten times and you always hear, “He told me, I should  enter,” you never hear “He told me, ‘Go in.’” This is to be explained by  the fact, already mentioned, that people bear in mind only the meaning  of what they have heard. When the question of the actual words is  raised, the sole way to conquer this disagreeable tendency is to develop  dialogue and to say to the witness, “Now you are A and I am B; how did  it happen?” But even this device may fail, and when you finally do  compel direct quotation, you can not be certain of its reliability, for  it was too extraordinary for the witness to quote directly, and the  extraordinary and unhabitual is always unsafe.    What especially wants consideration in the real peasant is his silence.  I do not know whether the reasons for the silence of the countrymen all  the world over have ever been sought, but a gossiping peasant is rare to  find. This trait is unfortunately exhibited in the latter’s failure to  defend himself when we make use of energetic investigation. It is said  that not to defend yourself is to show courage, and this may, indeed, be  a kind of nobility, a disgust at the accusation, or certainty of  innocence, but frequently it is mere incapacity to speak, and  inexperienced judges may regard it as an expression of cunning or  conviction. It is wise therefore, in this connection, not to be in too  great a hurry, and to seek to understand clearly the nature of the  silent person. If we become convinced that the latter is by nature  uncommunicative, we must not wonder that he does not speak, even when  words appear to be quite necessary.    In certain cases uneducated people must be studied from the same point  of view as children. Geiger[245] speaks of a child who knew only one  boy, and all the other boys were Otho to him because this first boy was  called Otho. So the recruit at the Rhine believed that in his country  the Rhine was called Donau. The child and the uneducated person can not  subordinate things under higher concepts. Every painted square might be  a bon-bon, and every painted circle a plate. New things receive the  names of old ones. And frequently the skill of the criminalists consists  in deriving important material from apparently worthless statements, by  way of discovering the proper significance of simple, inartistic, but in  most cases excellently definitive images. It is of course self-evident  that one must absolutely refrain from trickery.      Section 62. (c) Incorrect Forms of Expression.    If it is true that by the earnest and repeated study of the meanings of  words we are likely to find them in the end containing much deeper sense  and content than at the beginning, we are compelled to wonder that  people are able to understand each other at all. For if words do not  have that meaning which is obvious in their essential denotation, every  one who uses them supplies according to his inclination, and status the  “deeper and richer sense.” As a matter of fact many more words are used  pictorially than we are inclined to think. Choose at random, and you  find surprisingly numerous words with exaggerated denotations. If I say,  “I posit the case, I press through, I jump over, the proposition, etc.,”  these phrases are all pictures, for I have posited nothing, I have  pressed through no obstacle, and have jumped over no object. My words,  therefore, have not stood for anything real, but for an image, and it is  impossible to determine the remoteness of the latter from the former, or  the variety of direction and extent this remoteness may receive from  each individual. Wherever images are made use of, therefore, we must, if  we are to know what is meant, first establish how and where the use  occurred. How frequently we hear, e.g., of a “four-cornered” table  instead of a square table; a “very average” man, instead of a man who is  far below the average. In many cases this false expression is  half-consciously made for the purpose of beautifying a request or making  it appear more modest. The smoker says: “May I have some light,”  although you know that it is perfectly indifferent whether much or  little light is taken from the cigar. “May I have just a little piece of  roast,” is said in order to make the request that the other fellow  should pass the heavy platter seem more modest. And again: “Please give  me a little water,” does not modify the fact that the other fellow must  pass the whole water flask, and that it is indifferent to him whether  afterwards you take much or little water. So, frequently, we speak of  borrowing or lending, without in the remotest thinking of returning. The  student says to his comrade, “Lend me a pen, some paper, or some ink,”  but he has not at all any intention of giving them back. Similar things  are to be discovered in accused or witnesses who think they have not  behaved properly, and who then want to exhibit their misconduct in the  most favorable light. These beautifications frequently go so far and may  be made so skilfully that the correct situation may not be observed for  a long time. Habitual usage offers, in this case also, the best  examples. For years uncountable it has been called a cruel job to earn  your living honestly and to satisfy the absolute needs of many people by  quickly and painlessly slaughtering cattle. But, when somebody, just for  the sake of killing time, because of ennui, shoots and martyrs harmless  animals, or merely so wounds them that if they are not retrieved they  must die terrible deaths, we call it noble sport. I should like to see a  demonstration of the difference between killing an ox and shooting a  stag. The latter does not require even superior skill, for it is much  more difficult to kill an ox swiftly and painlessly than to shoot a stag  badly, and even the most accurate shot requires less training than the  correct slaughter of an ox. Moreover, it requires much more courage to  finish a wild ox than to destroy a tame and kindly pheasant. But usage,  once and for all, has assumed this essential distinction between men,  and frequently this distinction is effective in criminal law, without  our really seeing how or why. The situation is similar in the difference  between cheating in a horse trade and cheating about other commodities.  It occurs in the distinction between two duellists fighting according to  rule and two peasant lads brawling with the handles of their picks  according to agreement. It recurs again in the violation of the law by  somebody “nobly inspired with champagne,” as against its violation by  some “mere” drunkard. But usage has a favoring, excusing intent for the  first series, and an accusing, rejecting intent for the latter series.  The different points of view from which various events are seen are the  consequence of the varieties of the usage which first distinguished the  view-points from one another.    There is, moreover, a certain dishonesty in speaking and in listening  where the speaker knows that the hearer is hearing a different matter,  and the hearer knows that the speaker is speaking a different matter. As  Steinthal[246] has said, “While the speaker speaks about things that he  does not believe, and the reality of which he takes no stock in, his  auditor, at the same time, knows right well what the former has said; he  understands correctly and does not blame the speaker for having  expressed himself altogether unintelligibly.” This occurs very  frequently in daily routine, without causing much difficulty in human  intercourse, but it ought, for this reason, to occur inversely in our  conversation with witnesses and accused. I know that the manner of  speaking just described is frequently used when a witness wants to  clothe some definite suspicion without expressing it explicitly. In such  cases, e.g., the examiner as well as the witness believes that X is the  criminal. For some reason, perhaps because X is a close relation of the  witness or of “the man higher up,” neither of them, judge nor witness,  wishes to utter the truth openly, and so they feel round the subject for  an interminable time. If now, both think the same thing, there results  at most only a loss of time, but no other misfortune. When, however,  each thinks of a different object, e.g., each thinks of another  criminal, but each believes mistakenly that he agrees with the other,  their separating without having made explicit what they think, may lead  to harmful misunderstandings. If the examiner then believes that the  witness agrees with him and proceeds upon this only apparently certain  basis, the case may become very bad. The results are the same when a  confession is discussed with a suspect, i.e., when the judge thinks that  the suspect would like to confess, but only suggests confession, while  the latter has never even thought of it. The one thing alone our work  permits of is open and clear speaking; any confused form of expression  is evil.    Nevertheless, confusions often occur involuntarily, and as they can not  be avoided they must be understood. Thus, it is characteristic to  understand something unknown in terms of some known example, i.e., the  Romans who first saw an elephant, called it “bos lucani.” Similarly  “wood-dog” = wolf; “sea-cat” = monkey, etc. These are forms of common  usage, but every individual is accustomed to make such identifications  whenever he meets with any strange object. He speaks, therefore, to some  degree in images, and if his auditor is not aware of the fact he can  not understand him. His speaking so may be discovered by seeking out  clearly whether and what things were new and foreign to the speaker.  When this is learned it may be assumed that he will express himself in  images when considering the unfamiliar object. Then it will not be  difficult to discover the nature and source of the images.    Similar difficulties arise with the usage of foreign terms. It is of  course familiar that their incorrect use is not confined to the  uneducated. I have in mind particularly the weakening of the meaning in  our own language. The foreign word, according to Volkmar, gets its  significance by robbing the homonymous native word of its definiteness  and freshness, and is therefore sought out by all persons who are  unwilling to call things by their right names. The “_triste_ position”  is far from being so sad as the “sad” position. I should like to know  how a great many people could speak, if they were not permitted to say  _malheur_, _méchant_, _perfide_, etc.--words by means of which they  reduce the values of the terms at least a degree in intensity of  meaning. The reason for the use of these words is not always the  unwillingness of the speaker to make use of the right term, but really  because it is necessary to indicate various degrees of intensity for the  same thing without making use of attributes or other extensions of the  term. Thus the foreign word is in some degree introduced as a technical  expression. The direction in which the native word weakens, however,  taken as that is intended by the individual who uses its substitute, is  in no sense universally fixated. The matter is entirely one of  individual usage and must be examined afresh in each particular case.    The striving for abbreviated forms of expression,--extraordinary enough  in our gossipy times,--manifests itself in still another direction. On  my table, e.g., there is an old family journal, “From Cliff to Sea.”  What should the title mean? Obviously the spatial distribution of the  subject of its contents and its subscribers--i.e., “round about the  whole earth,” or “Concerning all lands and all peoples.” But such titles  would be too long; hence, they are synthesized into, “From Cliff to  Sea,” without the consideration that cliffs often stand right at the  edge of the sea, so that the distance between them may be only the  thickness of a hair:--cliff and sea are not local opposites.    Or: my son enters and tells me a story about an “old semester.” By “old  semester” he means an old student who has spent many terms, at least  more than are required or necessary, at the university. As this  explanation is too long, the whole complex is contracted into “old  semester,” which is comfortable, but unintelligible to all people not  associated with the university. These abbreviations are much more  numerous than, as a rule, they are supposed to be, and must always be  explained if errors are to be avoided. Nor are silent and monosyllabic  persons responsible for them; gossipy individuals seek, by the use of  them, to exhibit a certain power of speech. Nor is it indifferent to  expression when people in an apparently nowise comfortable fashion give  approximate circumlocutive figures, e.g., _half-a-dozen_, four  syllables, instead of the monosyllable _six_; or “the bell in the dome  at St. Stephen’s has as many nicks as the year has days,” etc. It must  be assumed that these circumlocutive expressions are chosen, either  because of the desire to make an assertion general, or because of the  desire for some mnemonic aid. It is necessary to be cautious with such  statements, either because, as made, they only “round out” the figures  or because the reliability of the aid to memory must first be tested.  Finally, it is well-known that foreign words are often changed into  senseless words of a similar sound. When such unintelligible words are  heard, very loud repeated restatement of the word will help in finding  the original.          TITLE B. DIFFERENTIATING CONDITIONS OF GIVING TESTIMONY.      Topic 1. GENERAL DIFFERENCES.    (a) Woman.      Section 63. (1) _General Considerations._[247]    One of the most difficult tasks of the criminalist who is engaged in  psychological investigation is the judgment of woman. Woman is not only  somatically and psychically rather different from man; man never is able  wholly and completely to put himself in her place. In judging a male the  criminalist is dealing with his like, made of the same elements as he,  even though age, conditions of life, education, and morality are as  different as possible. When the criminalist is to judge a gray-beard  whose years far outnumber his own, he still sees before him something  that he may himself become, built as he, but only in a more advanced  stage. When he is studying a boy, he knows what he himself felt and  thought as boy. For we never completely forget attitudes and judgments,  no matter how much time has elapsed--we no longer grasp them en masse,  but we do not easily fail to recall how they were constructed. Even when  the criminalist is dealing with a girl before puberty he is not without  some point of approach for his judgment, since boys and girls are at  that period not so essentially different as to prevent the drawing of  analogous inferences by the comparison of his own childhood with that of  the girl.    But to the nature of woman, we men totally lack avenues of approach. We  can find no parallel between women and ourselves, and the greatest  mistakes in criminal law were made where the conclusions would have been  correct if the woman had been a man.[248] We have always estimated the  deeds and statements of women by the same standards as those of men, and  we have always been wrong. That woman is different from man is testified  to by the anatomist, the physician, the historian, the theologian, the  philosopher; every layman sees it for himself. Woman is different in  appearance, in manner of observation, of judgment, of sensation, of  desire, of efficacy,--but we lawyers punish the crimes of woman as we do  those of man, and we count her testimony as we do that of man. The  present age is trying to set aside the differences in sex and to level  them, but it forgets that the law of causation is valid here also. Woman  and man have different bodies, hence they must have different minds. But  even when we understand this, we proceed wrongly in the valuation of  woman. We can not attain proper knowledge of her because we men were  never women, and women can never tell us the truth because they were  never men.    Just as a man is unable to discover whether he and his neighbor call the  same color red, so, eternally, will the source of the indubitably  existent differences in the psychic life of male and female be  undiscovered. But if we can not learn to understand the essence of the  problem of the eternal feminine, we may at least study its  manifestations and hope to find as much clearness as the difficulty of  the subject will permit. An essential, I might say, unscientific  experience seems to come to our aid here. In this matter, we trust the  real researches, the determinations of scholars, much less than the  conviction of the people, which is expressed in maxims, legal  differences, usage, and proverbs. We instinctively feel that the popular  conception presents the experience of many hundreds of years,  experiences of both men and women. So that we may assume that the  mistakes of the observations of individuals have corrected each other  as far as has been possible, and yield a kind of average result. Now,  even if averages are almost always wrong, either because they appear too  high or too low, the mistake is not more than half a mistake. If in a  series of numbers the lowest was 4, the highest 12, and the average 8,  and if I take the latter for the individual problem, I can at most have  been mistaken about four, never about eight, as would have been the case  if I had taken 4 or 12 for each other. The attitude of the people gives  us an average and we may at least assume that it would not have  maintained itself, either as common law or as proverb, if centuries had  not shown that the mistake involved was not a very great one.    In any event, the popular method was comparatively simple. No delicate  distinctions were developed. A general norm of valuation was applied to  woman and the result showed that woman is simply a less worthy creature.  This conception we find very early in the history of the most civilized  peoples, as well as among contemporary backward nations and tribes. If,  now, we generally assume that the culture of a people and the position  of its women have the same measure, it follows only that increasing  education revealed that the simple assumption of the inferiority of  woman was not correct, that the essential difference in psyche between  man and woman could not be determined, and that even today, the old  conception half unconsciously exercises an influence on our valuation of  woman, when in any respect we are required to judge her. Hence, we are  in no wise interested in the degree of subordination of woman among  savage and half-savage peoples, but, on the other hand, it is not  indifferent for us to know what the situation was among peoples and  times who have influenced our own culture. Let us review the situation  hastily.    A number of classical instances which are brought together by Fink[249]  and Smith,[250] show how little the classic Greek thought of woman, and  W. Becker[251] estimates as most important the fact that the Greek  always gave precedence to children and said, “τἑχνα χαἱ γυναἱχας.” The  Greek naturalists, Hippocrates and Aristotle, modestly held woman to be  half human, and even the poet Homer is not free from this point of view  (cf. the advice of Agamemnon to Odysseus). Moreover, he speaks mostly  concerning the scandalmongering and lying of women, while later,  Euripides directly reduces the status of women to the minimum (cf.  Iphigenia).    The attention of ancient Rome is always directed upon the puzzling,  sphinx-like, unharmonious qualities in woman. Horace gives it the  clearest expression, e.g., “Desinite in piscem mulier formosa superne.”    The Orientals have not done any better for us. The Chinese assert that  women have no souls. The Mohammedan believes that women are denied  entrance to paradise, and the Koran (xliii, 17) defines the woman as a  creature which grows up on a soil of finery and baubles, and is always  ready to nag. How well such an opinion has sustained itself, is shown by  the Ottomanic Codex 355, according to which the testimony of two women  is worth as much as the testimony of one man. But even so, the Koran has  a higher opinion of women than the early church fathers. The problem,  “An mulier habeat animam,” was often debated at the councils. One of  them, that of Macon, dealt earnestly with the MS. of Acidalius,  “Mulieres homines non esse.” At another, women were forbidden to touch  the Eucharist with bare hands. This attitude is implied by the content  of countless numbers of evil proverbs which deal with the inferior  character of woman, and certainly by the circumstance that so great a  number of women were held to be witches, of whom about 100,000 were  burned in Germany alone. The statutes dealt with women only in so far as  their trustworthiness as witnesses could be depreciated. The  Bambergensis (Art. 76), for example, permits the admission of young  persons and women only in special cases, and the quarrels of the older  lawyers concerning the value of feminine testimony is shown by  Mittermaier.[252]    If we discount Tacitus’ testimony concerning the high status of women  among the Germanic tribes on the basis that he aimed at shaming and  reforming his countrymen, we have a long series of assertions, beginning  with that of the Norseman Havamál,--which progressively speaks of women  in depreciatory fashion, and calls them inconstant, deceitful, and  stupefying,--to the very modern maxim which brings together the extreme  elevation and extreme degradation of woman: “Give the woman wings and  she is either an angel or a beast.” Terse as this expression is, it  ought to imply the proper point of view--women are either superior or  inferior to us, and may be both at the same time. There are women who  are superior and there are women who are inferior, and further, a  single woman may be superior to us in some qualities and inferior in  others, but she is not like us in any. The statement that woman is as  complete in her own right as man is in his, agrees with the attitude  above-mentioned if we correlate the superiority and inferiority of women  with “purposefulness.” We judge a higher or lower organism from our  standpoint of power to know, feel, and do, but we judge without  considering whether these organisms imply or not the purposes we assume  for them. Thus a uniform, monotonous task which is easy but requires  uninterrupted attention can be better performed by an average, patient,  unthinking individual, than by a genial fiery intellect. The former is  much more to the purpose of this work than the latter, but he does not  stand higher. The case is so with woman. For many of the purposes  assigned to her, she is better constructed. But whether this  construction, from our standpoint of knowing and feeling, is to be  regarded as higher or lower is another question.    Hence, we are only in a sense correct, when calling some feminine trait  which does not coincide with our own a poorer, inferior quality. We are  likely to overlook the fact that this quality taken in itself, is the  right one for the nature and the tasks of woman, whereas we ought with  the modern naturalist assume that every animal has developed correctly  for its own purposes. If this were not the case with woman she would be  the first exception to the laws of natural evolution. Hence, our task is  not to seek out peculiarities and rarities in woman, but to study her  status and function as given her by nature. Then we shall see that what  we would otherwise have called extraordinary appears as natural  necessity. Of course many of the feminine qualities will not bring us  back to the position which has required them. Then we may or may not be  able to infer it according to the laws of general co-existence, but  whether we establish anything directly or indirectly must be for the  time, indifferent; we do know the fact before us. If we find only the  pelvis of a human skeleton we should be able to infer from its broad  form that it belonged to a woman and should be able to ground this  inference on the business of reproduction which is woman’s. But we shall  also be able, although we have only the pelvis before us, to make  reliable statements concerning the position of the bones of the lower  extremities of _this_ individual. And we shall be able to say just what  the form of the thorax and the curve of the vertebral column were. This,  also, we shall have in our power, more or less, to ground on the  child-bearing function of woman. But we might go still further and say  that this individual, who, according to its pelvic cavity, was a woman,  must have had a comparatively smaller skull, and although we can not  correlate the present mark with the child-bearing function or any other  special characteristic of woman, we may yet infer it safely, because we  know that this smaller skull capacity stands in regular relation to the  broad pelvis, etc. In a like manner it will be possible to bring  together collectively various psychical differences of woman, to define  a number of them as directly necessary, and to deduce another number  from their regular co-existence. The certainty here will be the same as  in the former case, and once it is attained we shall be able  satisfactorily to interpret the conduct, etc., of woman.    Before turning to feminine psychology I should like briefly to touch  upon the use of the literature in our question and indicate that the  poets’ results are not good for us so long as we are trying to satisfy  our particular legal needs. We might, of course, refer to the poet for  information concerning the feminine heart,--woman’s most important  property,--but the historically famous knowers of the woman’s heart  leave us in the lurch and even lead us into decided errors. We are not  here concerned with the history of literature, nor with the solution of  the “dear riddle of woman;” we are dry-souled lawyers who seek to avoid  mistakes at the expense of the honor and liberty of others, and if we do  not want to believe the poets it is only because of many costly  mistakes. Once we were all young and had ideals. What the poets told us  we supposed to be the wisdom of life--nobody else ever offers any--and  we wanted compulsorily to solve the most urgent of human problems with  our poetical views. Illusions, mistakes, and guiltless remorse, were the  consequence of this topsy-turvy work.    Of course I do not mean to drag our poets to court and accuse them of  seducing our youth with false gods--I am convinced that if the poets  were asked they would tell us that their poetry was intended for all  save for physicians and criminalists. But it is conceivable that they  have introduced points of view that do not imply real life. Poetical  forms do not grow up naturally, and then suddenly come together in a  self-originated idea. The poet creates the idea first, and in order that  this may be so the individual form must evolve according to sense. The  more natural and inevitable this process becomes the better the poem,  but it does not follow that since we do not doubt it because it seems so  natural, it mirrors the process of life. Not one of us criminalists has  ever seen a form as described in a poem--least of all a woman.  Obviously, in our serious and dry work, we may be able to interpret many  an observation and assertion of the poet as a golden truth, but only  when we have tested its correctness for the daily life. But it must be  understood that I am not saying here, that we ourselves might have been  able to make the observation, or to abstract a truth from the flux of  appearances, or at least to set it in beautiful, terse, and I might say  convincing, form. I merely assert, that we must be permitted to examine  whether what has been beautifully said may be generalized, and whether  we then have found the same, or a similar thing, in the daily life.  Paradoxical as it sounds, we must never forget that there is a kind of  evidentiality in the form of beauty itself. One of Klopstock’s  remarkable psalms begins: “Moons wander round the earth, earths round  suns, the whole host of suns wander round a greater sun, Our Father,  that art thou.” In this inexpressibly lofty verse there is essentially,  and only in an extremely intensified fashion, evidence of the existence  of God, and if the convinced atheist should read this verse he would, at  least for the moment, believe in his existence. At the same time, a real  development of evidence is neither presented nor intended. There are  magnificent images, unassailable true propositions: the moon goes round  about the earth, the earth about the sun, the whole system around a  central sun--and now without anything else, the fourth proposition  concerning the identity of the central sun with our heavenly Father is  added as true. And the reader is captivated for at least a minute! What  I have tried here to show by means of a drastic example occurs many  times in poems, and is especially evident where woman is the subject, so  that we may unite in believing that the poet can not teach us that  subject, that he may only lead us into errors.    To learn about the nature of woman and its difference from that of man  we must drop everything poetical. Most conscientiously we must drop all  cynicism and seek to find illumination only in serious disciplines.  These disciplines may be universal history and the history of culture,  but certainly not memoirs, which always represent subjective experience  and one-sided views. Anatomy, physiology, anthropology, and serious  special literature, presupposed, may give us an unprejudiced outlook,  and then with much effort we may observe, compare, and renew our tests  of what has been established, sine ira et studio, sine odio et gratia.    I subjoin a list of sources and of especial literature which also  contains additional references.[253]      Section 64. 2. _Difference between Man and Women._    There are many attempts to determine the difference between the feminine  and masculine psyche. Volkmar in his “Textbook of Psychology” has  attempted to review these experiments. But the individual instances show  how impossible is clear and definite statement concerning the matter.  Much is too broad, much too narrow; much is unintelligible, much at  least remotely correct only if one knows the outlook of the discoverer  in question, and is inclined to agree with him. Consider the following  series of contrasts.          _Male_                        _Female_    Individuality          Receptivity (Burdach, Berthold)    Activity               Passivity (Daub, Ulrici, Hagemann)    Leadership             Imitativeness (Schleiermacher)    Vigor                  Sensitivity to stimulation (Beneke)    Conscious activity     Unconscious activity (Hartmann)    Conscious deduction    Unconscious induction (Wundt)    Will                   Consciousness (Fischer)    Independence           Completeness (Krause, Lindemann)    Particularity          Generally generic (Volkmann)    Negation               Affirmation (Hegel and his school)    None of these contrasts are satisfactory, many are unintelligible.  Burdach’s is correct only within limits and Hartmann’s is approximately  true if you accept his point of view. I do not believe that these  explanations would help anybody or make it easier for him to understand  woman. Indeed, to many a man they will appear to be saying merely that  the psyche of the male is masculine, that of the female feminine. The  thing is not to be done with epigrams however spirited. Epigrams merely  tend to increase the already great confusion.    Hardly more help toward understanding the subject is to be derived from  certain expressions which deal with a determinate and also with a  determining trait of woman. For example, the saying, “On forbidden  ground woman is cautious and man keen,” may, under some circumstances,  be of great importance in a criminal case, particularly when it is  necessary to fix the sex of the criminal. If the crime was cautiously  committed a woman may be inferred, and if swiftly, a man. But that maxim  is deficient in two respects. Man and woman deal in the way described,  not only in forbidden fields, but generally. Again, such characteristics  may be said to be ordinary but in no wise regulative: there are enough  cases in which the woman was much keener than the man and the man much  more cautious than the woman.    The greatest danger of false conceptions lies in the attribution of an  unproved peculiarity to woman, by means of some beautifully expressed,  and hence, apparently true, proverb. Consider the well known maxim: Man  forgives a beautiful woman everything, woman nothing. Taken in itself  the thing is true; we find it in the gossip of the ball-room, and in the  most dreadful of criminal cases. Men are inclined to reduce the conduct  of a beautiful sinner to the mildest and least offensive terms, while  her own sex judge her the more harshly in the degree of her beauty and  the number of its partisans. Now it might be easy in an attempt to draw  the following consequences from the correctness of this proposition: Men  are generally inclined to forgive in kindness, women are the unforgiving  creatures. This inference would be altogether unjustified, for the maxim  only incidentally has woman for its subject; it might as well read:  Woman forgives a handsome man everything, man nothing. What we have at  work here is the not particularly remarkable fact that envy plays a  great rôle in life.    Another difficulty in making use of popular truths in our own  observations, lies in their being expressed in more or less definite  images. If you say, for example, “Man begs with words, woman with  glances,” you have a proposition that might be of use in many criminal  cases, inasmuch as things frequently depend on the demonstration that  there was or was not an amour between two people (murder of a husband,  relation of the widow with a suspect).    Now, of course, the judge could not see how they conversed together, how  he spoke stormily and she turned her eyes away. But suppose that the  judge has gotten hold of some letters--then if he makes use of the  maxim, he will observe that the man becomes more explicit than the  woman, who, up to a certain limit, remains ashamed. So if the man speaks  very definitely in his letters, there is no evidence contradictory to  the inference of their relationship, even though nothing similar is to  be found in her letters. The thing may be expressed in another maxim:  What he wants is in the lines; what she wants between the lines.    The great difficulty of distinguishing between man and woman is  mentioned in “Levana oder Erziehungslehre,” by Jean Paul, who says, “A  woman can not love her child and the four continents of the world at the  same time. A man can.” But who has ever seen a man love four continents?  “He loves the concept, she the appearance, the particular.” What lawyer  understands this? And this? “So long as woman loves, she loves  continuously, but man has lucid intervals.” This fact has been otherwise  expressed by Grabbe, who says: “For man the world is his heart, for  woman her heart is the world.” And what are we to learn from this? That  the love of woman is greater and fills her life more? Certainly not. We  only see that man has more to do than woman, and this prevents him from  depending on his impressions, so that he can not allow himself to be  completely captured by even his intense inclinations. Hence the old  proverb: Every new affection makes man more foolish and woman wiser,  meaning that man is held back from his work and effectiveness by every  inclination, while woman, each time, gathers new experiences in life. Of  course, man also gets a few of these, but he has other and more valuable  opportunities of getting them, while woman, who has not his position in  the midst of life, must gather her experiences where she may.    Hence, it remains best to stick to simple, sober discoveries which may  be described without literary glamour, and which admit of no exception.  Such is the statement by Friedreich[254]: “Woman is more excitable, more  volatile and movable spiritually, than man; the mind dominates the  latter, the emotions the former. Man thinks more, woman senses more.”  These ungarnished, clear words, which offer nothing new, still contain  as much as may be said and explained. We may perhaps supplement them  with an expression of Heusinger’s, “Women have much reproductive but  little productive imaginative power. Hence, there are good landscape and  portrait painters among women, but as long as women have painted there  has not been any great woman-painter of history. They make poems,  romances, and sonnets, but not one of them has written a good tragedy.”  This expression shows that the imaginative power of woman is really more  reproductive than productive, and it may be so observed in crimes and  in the testimony of witnesses.    In crimes, this fact will not be easy to observe in the deed itself, or  in the manner of its execution; it will be observable in the nature of  the plan used. To say that the plan indicates productive creation would  not be to call it original. Originality can not be indicated, without  danger of misunderstanding, by means of even a single example; we have  simply to cling to the paradigm of Heusinger, and to say, that when the  plan of a criminal act appears more independent and more completely  worked out, it may be assumed to be of masculine origin; if it seeks  support, however, if it is an imitation of what has already happened, if  it aims to find outside assistance during its execution, its originator  was a woman. This truth goes so far that in the latter case the woman  must be fixed upon as the intellectual source of the plan, even though  the criminal actually was a man. The converse inference could hardly be  held with justice. If a man has thought out a plan which a woman is to  execute, its fundamental lines are wiped out and the woman permits the  productive aspect of the matter to disappear, or to become so indefinite  that any sure conclusion on the subject is impossible.    Our phenomenon is equally important in statements by witnesses. In many  a case in which we suppose the whole or a portion of a witness’s  testimony to be incorrect, intentionally invented, or involuntarily  imagined, we may succeed in extracting a part of the testimony as  independent construction, and thus determining what might be incorrect  in it. If, when this happens, the witness is a man and his lies show  themselves in productive form, and if the witness is a woman and her  lies appear to be reproduced, it is possible, at least, that we are  being told untruths. The procedure obviously does not in itself contain  anything evidential, but it may at least excite suspicion and thus  caution, and that, in many cases, is enough. I may say of my own work  that I have often gained much advantage from this method. If there were  any suspicion that the testimony of a witness, especially the conception  of some committed crime, was untrue, I recalled Heusinger, and asked  myself “If the thing is untrue, is it a sonnet or a tragedy?” If the  answer was “tragedy” and the witness a man, or, if the answer was  “sonnet” and the witness a woman, I concluded that everything was  possibly invented, and grew quite cautious. If I could come to no  conclusion, I was considerably helped by Heusinger’s other proposition,  asking myself, “Flower-pictures or historical subjects?” And here again  I found something to go by, and the need to be suspicious. I repeat, no  evidence is to be attained in this way, but we frequently win when we  are warned beforehand.      (3) _Sexual Peculiarities._      Section 65. (a) General Considerations.    Even if we know that hunger and love are not the only things that  sustain impulse, we also know the profound influence that love and all  that depends upon it exercise from time immemorial on the course of  events. This being generally true, the question of the influence of sex  on woman is more important than that of its influence on man, for a  large number of profound conditions are at work in the former which are  absent in the latter. Hence, it is in no way sufficient to consider only  the physiological traits of the somatic life of woman, i.e.,  menstruation, pregnancy, child-birth, the suckling period, and finally  the climacterium. We must study also the possibly still more important  psychical conditions which spring from the feminine nature and are  developed by the demands of civilization and custom. We must ask what it  means to character when an individual is required from the moment  puberty begins, to conceal something for a few days every month; what it  means when this secrecy is maintained for a long time during pregnancy,  at least toward children and the younger people. Nor can it be denied  that the custom which demands more self-control in women must exercise a  formative influence on their natures. Our views do not permit the woman  to show without great indirection whom she hates or whom she likes; nor  may she indicate clearly whom she loves, nor must she appear solicitous.  Everything must happen indirectly, secretly, and approximately, and if  this need is inherited for centuries, it must, as a characteristic,  impart a definite expression to the sex. This expression is of great  importance to the criminalist; it is often enough to recall these  circumstances in order to find explanation for a whole series of  phenomena. What differences the modern point of view and modern  tendencies will make remains to be seen.    Let us now consider particular characteristics.      Section 66. (b) Menstruation.    We men, in our own life, have no analogy, not even a remote one, to this  essentially feminine process. In the mental life of woman it is of  greater importance than we are accustomed to suppose. In most cases in  which it may be felt that the fact of menstruation influences a crime or  a statement of facts, it will be necessary to make use of the court  physician, who must report to the judge. The latter absolutely must  understand the fact and influence of menstruation. Of course he must  also have general knowledge of the whole matter, but he must require the  court physician definitely to tell him when the event began and whether  any diseased conditions were apparent. Then it is the business of the  judge to interpret the physician’s report psychologically--and the judge  knows neither more nor less psychology, according to his training, than  the physician. Any text-book on physiology will give the important facts  about menstruation. It is important for us to know that menses begin, in  our climate, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth year, and end between  the forty-fifth and the fiftieth year. The periods are normally a solar  month--from twenty-seven to twenty-eight days, and the menstruation  lasts from three to five days. After its conclusion the sexual impulse,  even in otherwise frigid women, is in most cases intensified. It is  important, moreover, to note the fact that most women, during their  periods, show a not insignificant alteration of their mental lives,  often exhibiting states of mind that are otherwise foreign to them.    As in many cases it is impossible without other justification to ask  whether menses have begun, it is worth while knowing that most women  menstruate, according to some authorities, during the first quarter of  the moon, and that only a few menstruate during the new or full moon.  The facts are very questionable, but we have no other cues for  determining that menstruation is taking place. Either the popularly  credited signs of it (e.g., a particular appearance, a significant  shining of the eyes, bad odor from the mouth, or susceptibility to  perspiration) are unreliable, or there are such signs as feeling unwell,  tension in the back, fatigue in the bones, etc., which are much more  simply and better discovered by direct interrogation, or examination by  a physician.    If there is any suspicion that menstruation has influenced testimony or  a crime, and if the other, especially the above-mentioned facts, are not  against it, we are called upon to decide whether we are considering a  mental event, due to the influence of menstruation. Icard[255] has  written the best monograph on this subject.    Considering the matter in detail, our attention is first called to the  importance of the beginning of menstruation. Never is a girl more  tender or quiet, never more spiritual and attractive, nor more inclined  to good sense, than in the beginning of puberty, generally a little  before the menstrual periods have begun, or have become properly  ordered. At this time, then, the danger that the young girl may commit a  crime is very small, perhaps smaller than at any other time. And hence,  it is the more to be feared that such a creature may become the victim  of the passions of a roué, or may cause herself the greatest harm by  mistaken conduct. This is the more possible when the circumstances are  such that the child has little to do, though naturally gifted. Unused  spiritual qualities, ennui, waking sensitivity and charm, make a  dangerous mixture, which is expressed as a form of interest in exciting  experiences, in the romantic, or at least the unusual. Sexual things are  perhaps wholly, or partly not understood, but their excitation is  present and the results are the harmless dreams of extraordinary  experiences. The danger is in these, for from them may arise fantasies,  insufficiently justified principles, and inclination to deceit. Then all  the prerequirements are present which give rise to those well-known  cases of unjust complaints, false testimony about seduction, rape,  attempts at rape and even arson, accusing letters, and slander.[256]  Every one of us is sufficiently familiar with such accusations, every  one of us knows how frequently we can not sufficiently marvel how such  and such an otherwise quiet, honest, and peaceful girl could perform  things so incomprehensible. If an investigation had been made to see  whether the feat did not occur at the time of her first mensis; if the  girl had been watched during her next mensis to determine whether some  fresh significant alteration occurred, the police physician might  possibly have been able to explain the event. I know many cases of  crimes committed by half-grown girls who would under no circumstances  have been accused of them; among them arson, lese majeste, the writing  of numerous anonymous letters, and a slander by way of complaining of a  completely fanciful seduction. In one of these cases we succeeded in  showing that the girl in question had committed her crime at the time of  her first mensis; that she was otherwise quiet and well conducted, and  that she showed at her next mensis some degree of significant unrest and  excitement. As soon as the menses got their proper adjustment not one of  the earlier phenomena could be observed, and the child exhibited no  further inclination to commit crimes.[257]    Creatures like her undergo similar danger when they have to make  statements about perceptions which are either interesting in themselves,  or have occurred in an interesting way. Here caution must be exercised  in two directions. First: Discover whether the child in question was  passing through her monthly period at the time when she saw the event  under discussion, or when she was telling about it. In the former case,  she has told of more than could have been perceived; in the second case  she develops the delusion that she had seen more than she really had.  How unreliable the testimony of youthful girls is, and what mistakes it  has caused, are familiar facts, but too little attention is paid to the  fact that this unreliability is not permanent with the individuals, and  in most cases changes into complete trustworthiness. As a rule, the  criminal judge is almost never in a position to determine the  inconsistencies in the testimony of a menstruating girl, inasmuch as he  sees her, at most, just a few times, and can not at those times observe  differences in her love for truth. Fortunately the statements of newly  menstruating girls, when untrue, are very characteristic, and present  themselves in the form of something essentially romantic, extraordinary,  and interesting. If we find this tendency of transforming simple daily  events into extraordinary experiences, then, if the testimony of the  girl does not agree with that of other witnesses, etc., we are warned.  Still greater assurance is easy to gain, by examining persons who know  the girl well on her trustworthiness and love of truth before this time.  If their statements intensify the suspicion that menses have been an  influence, it is not too much to ask directly, to re-examine, and, if  necessary, to call in medical aid in order to ascertain the truth. The  direct question is in a characteristically great number of cases  answered falsely. If in such cases we learn that the observation was  made or the testimony given at the menstrual period, we may assume it  probably justifiable to suspect great exaggeration, if not pure  invention.    The menstrual period tends, at all ages from the youngest child to the  full-grown woman, to modify the quality of perception and the truth of  description. Von Reichenbach[258] writes that sensitivity is intensified  during the menstrual period, and even if this famous discoverer has said  a number of crazy things on the subject, his record is such that he must  be regarded as a clever man and an excellent observer. There is no doubt  that his sensitive people were simply very nervous individuals who  reacted vigorously to all external stimulations, and inasmuch as his  views agree with others, we may assume that his observation shows at  least how emotional, excitable, and inclined to fine perceptions  menstruating women are. It is well-known how sharpened sense-perception  becomes under certain conditions of ill-health. Before you get a cold in  the head, the sense of smell is regularly intensified; certain headaches  are accompanied with an intensification of hearing so that we are  disturbed by sounds that otherwise we should not hear at all; every  bruised place on the body is very sensitive to touch. All in all, we  must believe that the senses of woman, especially her skin sensations,  the sensations of touch, are intensified during the menstrual period,  for at that time her body is in a “state of alarm.” This fact is  important in many ways. It is not improbable that one menstruating woman  shall have heard, seen, felt, and smelt, things which others, and she  herself, would not have perceived at another time. Again, if we trace  back many a conception of menstruating women we learn that the boundary  between more delicate sensating and sensibility can not be easily drawn.  Here we may see the universal transition from sensibility to acute  excitability which is a source of many quarrels. The witness, the  wounded, or accused are all, to a considerable degree, under its  influence. It is a generally familiar fact that the incomparably larger  number of complaints of attacks on women’s honor, fall through. It would  be interesting to know just how such complaints of menstruating women  occur. Of course, nobody can determine this statistically, but it is a  fact that such trials are best conducted, never exactly four weeks after  the crime, nor four weeks after the accusation. For if most of the  complaints of menstruating women are made at the period of their menses,  they are just as excited four weeks later, and opposed to every attempt  at adjustment. This is the much-verified fundamental principle! I once  succeeded by its use in helping a respectable, peace-loving citizen of a  small town, whose wife made uninterrupted complaints of inuriam causa,  and got the answer that his wife was an excellent soul, but, “gets the  devil in her during her monthlies, and tries to find occasions for  quarrels with everybody and finds herself immediately much insulted.”    A still more suspicious quality than the empty capacity for anger is  pointed out by Lombroso,[259] who says that woman during menstruation is  inclined to anger and to falsification. In this regard Lombroso may be  correct, inasmuch as the lie may be combined with the other qualities  here observed. We often note that most honorable women lie in the most  shameless fashion. If we find no other motive and we know that the woman  periodically gets into an abnormal condition, we are at least justified  in the presupposition that the two are coordinate, and that the periodic  condition is cause of the otherwise rare feminine lie. Here also, we are  required to be cautious, and if we hear significant and not otherwise  confirmed assertions from women, we must bear in mind that they may be  due to menstruation.    But we may go still further. Du Saulle[260] asserts on the basis of  far-reaching investigations, that a significant number of thefts in  Parisian shops are committed frequently by the most elegant ladies  during their menstrual period, and this in no fewer than 35 cases out of  36, while 10 more cases occurred at the beginning of the period.    Other authorities[261] who have studied this matter have shown how the  presentation of objects women much desire leads to theft. Grant that  during her mensis the woman is in a more excitable and less actively  resisting condition, and it may follow she might be easily overpowered  by the seductive quality of pretty jewelry and other knickknacks. This  possibility leads us, however, to remoter conclusions. Women desire more  than merely pretty things, and are less able to resist their desires  during their periods. If they are less able to resist in such things,  they are equally less able to resist in other things. In handling those  thefts which were formerly called kleptomaniac, and which, in spite of  the refusal to use this term, are undeniable, it is customary, if they  recur repeatedly, to see whether pregnancy is not the cause. It is well  to consider also the influence of menstruation.    Menstruation may bring women even to the most terrible crimes. Various  authors cite numerous examples in which otherwise sensible women have  been driven to the most inconceivable things--in many cases to murder.  Certainly such crimes will be much more numerous if the abnormal  tendency is unknown to the friends of the woman, who should watch her  carefully during this short, dangerous period.    The fact is familiar that the disturbances of menstruation lead to  abnormal psychoses. This type of mental disease develops so quietly  that in numerous cases the maladies are overlooked, and hence it is more  easily possible, since they are transitive, to interpret them commonly  as “nervous excitement,” or to pay no attention to them, although they  need it.[262]      Section 67. (c) Pregnancy.    We may speak of the conditions and effects of pregnancy very briefly.  The doubt of pregnancy will be much less frequent than that of  menstruation, for the powerful influence of pregnancy on the psychic  life of woman is well-known, and it is hence the more important to call  in the physician in cases of crimes committed by pregnant women, or in  cases of important testimony to be given by such women. But, indeed, the  frequently obvious remarkable desires, the significant conduct, and the  extraordinary, often cruel, impulses, which influence pregnant women,  and for the appearance of which the physician is to be called in, are  not the only thing. The most difficult and most far-reaching conditions  of pregnancy are the purely psychical ones which manifest themselves in  the sometimes slight, sometimes more obvious alterations in the woman’s  point of view and capacity for producing an event. In themselves they  seem of little importance, but they occasion such a change in the  attitude of an individual toward a happening which she must describe to  the judge, that the change may cause a change in the judgment. I repeat  here also, that it may be theoretically said, “The witness must tell us  facts, and only facts,” but this is not really so. Quite apart from the  fact that the statement of any perception contains a judgment, it  depends also and always on the point of view, and this varies with the  emotional state. If, then, we have never experienced any of the  emotional alteration to which a pregnant woman is subject, we must be  able to interpret it logically in order to hit on the correct thing. We  set aside the altered somatic conditions of the mother, the disturbance  of the conditions of nutrition and circulation; we need clearly to  understand what it means to have assumed care about a developing  creature, to know that a future life is growing up fortunately or  unfortunately, and is capable of bringing joy or sorrow, weal or woe to  its parents. The woman knows that her condition is an endangerment of  her own life, that it brings at least pains, sufferings, and  difficulties (as a rule, over-estimated by the pregnant woman).  Involuntarily she feels, whether she be educated or uneducated, the  secrecy, the elusiveness of the growing life she bears, the life which  is to come out into the world, and to bring its mother’s into jeopardy  thereby. She feels nearer death, and the various tendencies which are  attached to this feeling are determined by the nature and the conditions  of each particular future mother’s sensations. How different may be the  feeling of a poor abandoned bride who is expecting a child, from that of  a young woman who knows that she is to bring into the world the  eagerly-desired heir of name and fortune. Consider the difference  between the feeling of a sickly proletarian, richly blessed with  children, who knows that the new child is an unwelcome superfluity whose  birth may perhaps rob the other helpless children of their mother, with  the feeling of a comfortable, thoroughly healthy woman, who finds no  difference between having three or having four children.    And if these feelings are various, must they not be so intense and so  far-reaching as to influence the attitude of the woman toward some event  she has observed? It may be objected that the subjective attitude of a  witness will never influence a judge, who can easily discover the  objective truth in the one-sided observation of an event. But let us not  deceive ourselves, let us take things as they are. Subjective attitude  may become objective falsehood in spite of the best endeavor of the  witness, and the examiner may fail altogether to distinguish between  what is truth and what poetry. Further, in many instances the witness  must be questioned with regard to the impression the event made on her.  Particularly, if the event can not be described in words.    We must ask whether the witness’s impression was that an attack was  dangerous, a threat serious, a blackmail conceivable, a brawl  intentional, a gesture insulting, an assault premeditated. In these, and  thousands of other cases, we must know the point of view, and are  compelled to draw our deductions from it. And finally, who of us  believes himself to be altogether immune to emotional induction? The  witness describes us the event in definite tones which are echoed to us.  If there are other witnesses the incomplete view may be corrected, but  if there is only one witness, or one whom for some reason we believe  more than others, or if there are several, but equally-trusted  witnesses, the condition, view-point, and “fact,” remain inadequate in  us. Whoever has before him a pregnant woman with her impressions  altered in a thousand ways, may therefore well be “up in the air!”[263]    The older literature which develops an elaborate casuistic concerning  cases in which pregnant women exhibited especial desires, or abnormal  changes in their perceptions and expressions, is in many directions of  considerable importance. We must, however, remember that the old  observations are rarely exact and were always made with less knowledge  than we nowadays possess.      Section 68. (d) Erotic.    A question which is as frequent as it is idle, concerns the degree of  sexual impulse in woman. It is important for the lawyer to know  something about this, of course, for many a sexual crime may be more  properly judged if it is known how far the woman encouraged the man, and  in similar cases the knowledge might help us to presume what attitude  feminine witnesses might take toward the matter. First of all, the needs  of individual women are as different as those of individual men, and as  varied as the need for food, drink, warmth, rest, and a hundred other  animal requirements. We shall be unable to find any standard by  determining even an average. It is useless to say that sexual  sensibility is less in woman than in man; because specialists contradict  each other on this matter. We are not aided either by Sergi’s[264]  assertion, that the sensibility is less than the irritability in woman,  or by Mantegazza’s statement, that women rarely have such powerful  sexual desire that it causes them pain. We can learn here, also, only by  means of the interpretation of good particular observations. When, for  example, the Italian positivists repeatedly assert that woman is less  erotic and more sexual, they mean that man cares more about the  satisfaction of the sexual impulse, woman about the maternal instinct.  This piece of information may help us to explain some cases; at least we  shall understand many a girl’s mistake without needing immediately to  presuppose rape, seduction by means of promises of marriage, etc. Once  we have in mind soberly what fruits dishonor brings to a girl,--scorn  and shame, the difficulties of pregnancy, alienation from relatives,  perhaps even banishment from the paternal home, perhaps the loss of a  good position, then the pains and sorrows of child-birth, care of the  child, reduction of earnings, difficulties and troubles with the child,  difficulties in going about, less prospect of care through  wedlock,--these are of such extraordinary weight, that it is impossible  to adduce so elementary a force to the sexual impulse as to enable it to  veil the outlook upon this outcome of its satisfaction.    The well-known Viennese gynaecologist, Braun, said, “If it were  naturally so arranged that in every wedlock man must bear the second  child, there would be no more than three children in any family.” His  intention is, that even if the woman agrees to have the third child, the  man would be so frightened at the pains of the first child-birth that he  never again would permit himself to bear another. As we can hardly say  that we have any reason for asserting that the sexual needs of woman are  essentially greater, or that woman is better able to bear more pain than  man, we are compelled to believe that there must be in woman an impulse  lacking in man. This impulse must be supposed to be so powerful that it  subdues, let us say briefly, all the fear of an illegitimate or  otherwise undesirable child-birth, and this is the impulse we mean by  sexuality, by the maternal instinct.    It would seem as if nature, at least in isolated cases, desires to  confirm this view. According to Icard there are women who have children  simply for the pleasure of suckling them, the suckling being a pleasant  sensation. If, now, nature has produced a sexual impulse purely for the  sake of preserving the species, she has given fuller expression to  sexuality and the maternal instinct when she has endowed it with an  especial impulse in at least a few definite cases. This impulse will  explain to the criminalist a large number of phenomena, especially the  accommodation of woman to man’s desires; and from this alone he may  deduce a number of otherwise difficultly explainable psychical  phenomena.    There is, of course, a series of facts which deny the existence of this  impulse--but they only seem to. Child-murder, the very frequent cruelty  of mothers to their children, the opposition of very young women to  bearing and bringing up children (cf. the educated among French and  American women), and similar phenomena seem to speak against the  maternal instinct. We must not forget, however, that all impulses come  to an end where the opposed impulse becomes stronger, and that under  given circumstances even the most powerful impulse, that of  self-preservation, may be opposed. All actions of despair, tearing the  beard, beating hands and feet together, rage at one’s own health, and  finally suicide may ensue. If the mother kills her own child, this  action belongs to the same series as self-damage through despair. The  more orderly and numerous actions and feelings in this direction, e.g.,  the disinclination of women toward bearing children, may be explained  also by the fact that it is the consequence of definite conditions of  civilization. If we recall what unnatural, senseless, and half crazy  habits with regard to nutrition, dressing, social adjustments, etc.,  civilization and fashion have forced upon us, we do not need to adduce  real perversity in order to understand how desire for comfort, how  laziness and the scramble for wealth lead to suppression of the maternal  instinct. This may also be called degeneration. There are still other  less important circumstances that seem to speak against the maternal  instinct. These consist primarily in the fact that the sexual impulse  endures to a time when the mother is no longer young enough to bear a  child. We know that the first gray hair in no sense indicates the last  lover, and according to Tait, a period of powerful sex-impulsion ensues  directly after the climacterium. Now of what use, so far as child-birth  is concerned, can such an impulse be?    But because natural instincts endure beyond their period of purposive  efficiency, it does not follow that they are unconnected with that  efficiency; we eat and drink also when the food is superfluous as  nourishment. Wonderfully as nature has adjusted the instincts and  functions to definite purposes, she still has at no point drawn fixed  boundaries and actually destroyed her instrument where the need for it  ceased. Just because nature is elsewhere parsimonious, she seems  frequently extravagant; yet that extravagance is the cheapest means of  attaining the necessary end. Thus, when woman’s passion is no longer  required for the function of motherhood, its impulsion may yet be  counted on for the psychological explanation of more than one criminal  event.    What is important, is to count the maternal instinct as a factor in  criminal situations. If we have done so, we find explanations not only  of sexual impropriety, but of the more subtle questions of the more or  less pure relation between husband and wife. What attitude the woman  takes toward her husband and children, what she demands of them, what  she sacrifices for them, what makes it possible for her to endure an  apparently unendurable situation; what, again, undermines directly and  suddenly, in spite of seemingly small value, her courage in life;--these  are all conditions which appear in countless processes as the  distinguishing and explaining elements, and they are to be understood in  the single term, “maternal instinct.” For a long time the  inexplicability of love and sexual impulse were offered as excuses, but  these otherwise mighty factors had to be assigned such remarkable and  self-contradictory aspects that only one confusion was added to another  and called explanation. Now suppose we try to explain them by means of  the maternal instinct.      Section 69. (e) Submerged Sexual Factors.    The criminal psychologist finds difficulties where hidden impulses are  at work without seeming to have any relation to their results. In such  cases the starting-point for explanation is sought in the wrong  direction. I say starting-point, because “motive” must be conscious, and  “ground” might be misunderstood. We know of countless criminal cases  which we face powerless because we do indeed know the criminal but are  unable to explain the causal connection between him and the crime, or  because, again, we do not know the criminal, and judge from the facts  that we might have gotten a clew if we had understood the psychological  development of the crime. If we seek for “grounds,” we may possibly  think of so many of them as never to approach the right one; if we seek  motives, we may be far misled because we are able only to bring the  criminal into connection with his success, a matter which he must have  had in mind from the beginning. It is ever easy for us when motive and  crime are in open connection: greed, theft; revenge, arson; jealousy,  murder; etc. In these cases the whole business of examination is an  example in arithmetic, possibly difficult, but fundamental. When,  however, from the deed to its last traceable grounds, even to the  attitude of the criminal, a connected series may be discovered and yet  no explanation is forthcoming, then the business of interpretation has  reached its end; we begin to feel about in the dark. If we find nothing,  the situation is comparatively good, but it is exceedingly bad in the  numerous cases in which we believe ourselves to have sighted and pursued  the proper solution.    Such a hidden source or starting-point of very numerous crimes is sex.  That it often works invisibly is due to the sense of shame. Therefore it  is more frequent in women. The hidden sexual starting-point plays its  part in the little insignificant lie of an unimportant woman witness, as  well as in the poisoning of a husband for the sake of a paramour still  to be won. It sails everywhere under a false flag; nobody permits the  passion to show in itself; it must receive another name, even in the  mind of the woman whom it dominates.    The first of the forms which the sexual impulse takes is false piety,  religiosity. This is something ancient. Friedreich points to the  connection between religious activity and the sexual organization, and  cites many stories about saints, like that of the nun Blanbekin, of whom  it was said, “eam scire desiderasse cum lacrimis, et moerore maximo,  ubinam esset praeputium Christi.” The holy Veronica Juliani, in memory  of the lamb of God, took a lamb to bed with her and nursed it at her  breast. Similarly suggestive things are told of St. Catherine of Genoa,  of St. Armela, of St. Elizabeth, of the Child Jesus, etc. Reinhard says  correctly that sweet memories are frequently nothing more or less than  outbursts of hidden passion and attacks of sensual love. Seume is  mistaken in his assertion that mysticism lies mainly in weakness of the  nerves and colic--it lies a span deeper.    The use of this fact is simple. We must discover whether a woman is  morally pure or sensual, etc. This is important, not only in violations  of morality, but in every violation of law. The answers we receive to  questions on this matter are almost without exception worthless or  untrue, because the object of the question is not open to view, is  difficult to observe, and is kept hidden from even the nearest. Our  purpose is, therefore, best attained by directing the question to  religious activity, religiosity, and similar traits. These are not only  easy to perceive, but are openly exhibited because of their nature.  Whoever assumes piety, does so for the sake of other people, therefore  does not hide it. If religious extravagance can be reliably confirmed by  witnesses, it will rarely be a mistake to assume inclination to more or  less stifled sexual pleasure.    Examples of the relationship are known to every one of us, but I want to  cite two out of my own experience as types. In one of them the question  turned on the fact that a somewhat old, unmarried woman had appropriated  certain rather large trust sums and had presented them to her servant.  At first every suspicion of the influence of sex was set aside. Only the  discovery of the fact that in her ostentatious piety she had set up an  altar in her house, and compelled her servant to pray at it in her  company, called attention to the deep interest of this very moral maiden  in her servant.    The second case dealt with the poisoning of an old, impotent husband by  his young wife. The latter was not suspected by anybody, but at her  examination drew suspicion to herself by her unctuous, pious appearance.  She was permitted to express herself at length on religious themes and  showed so very great a love of saints and religious secrets that it was  impossible to doubt that a glowing sensuality must be concealed  underneath this religious ash. Adultery could not be proved, she must  have for one reason or another avoided it, and that her impotent husband  was unsatisfactory was now indubitable. The supposition that she wanted  to get rid of him in order to marry somebody else was now inevitable;  and as this somebody else was looked for and discovered, the adduction  of evidence of her guilt was no longer difficult.    How captious it is to prove direct passion and to attach reasonable  suspicion thereto, and how necessary it is, first of all, to establish  what the concealing material is, is shown in a remark of Kraus,[265] who  asserts that the wife never affects to be passionate with her husband;  her desire is to seduce him and she could not desire that if she were  not passionate. This assertion is only correct in general. It is not,  however, true that woman has no reason for affectation, for there are  enough cases in which some woman, rendered with child by a poor man,  desires to seduce a man of wealth in order to get a wealthy father for  her child. In such and similar cases, the woman could make use of every  trick of seduction without needing to be in the least passionately  disposed.    Another important form of submerged sexuality is ennui. Nobody can say  what ennui is, and everybody knows it most accurately. Nobody would say  that it is burdensome, and yet everybody knows, again, that a large  group of evil deeds spring from ennui. It is not the same as idleness; I  may be idle without being bored, and I may be bored although I am busy.  At best, boredom may be called an attitude which the mind is thrown into  because of an unsatisfied desire for different things. We speak of a  tedious region, a tedious lecture, and tedious company only by way of  metonymy--we always mean the emotional state they put us into. The  internal condition is determinative, for things that are boresome to one  may be very interesting to another. A collection, a library, a lecture,  are all tedious and boresome by transposition of the emotional state to  the objective content, and in this way the idea of boredom gets a wide  scope. We, however, shall speak of boredom as an emotional state. We  find it most frequently among girls, young women, and among undeveloped  or feminine men as a very significant phenomenon. So found, it is that  particular dreamful, happy, or unhappy attitude expressed in desire for  something absent, in quiet reproaches concerning the lack of the  satisfaction of that desire, with the continually recurring wish for  filling out an inner void. The basis of all this is mainly sex. It can  not be proved as such mathematically, but experience shows that the  emotional attitude occurs only in the presence of sexual energy, that it  is lacking when the desires are satisfied, but that otherwise, even the  richest and best substitution can offer no satisfaction. It is not  daring, therefore, to infer the erotic starting-point. Again we see how  the moralizing and training influence of rigidly-required work  suppresses all superfluous states which themselves make express demands  and might want complete satisfaction.    But everything has its limits, and frequently the gentle, still power of  sweet ennui is stronger than the pressure and compulsion of work. When  this power is present, it never results in good, rarely in anything  indifferent, and frequently forbidden fruit ripens slowly in its shadow.  Nobody will assert that ennui is the cause of illicit relations, of  seduction, of adultery and all the many sins that depend on it--from  petty misappropriations for the sake of the beloved, to the murder of  the unloved husband. But ennui is for the criminal psychologist a sign  that the woman was unsatisfied with what she had and wanted something  else. From wishing to willing, from willing to asking, is not such a  great distance. But if we ask the repentant sinner when she began to  think of her criminal action we always learn that she suffered from  incurable ennui, in which wicked thoughts came and still more wicked  plans were hatched. Any experienced criminal psychologist will tell you,  when you ask him, whether he has been much subject to mistakes in trying  to explain women’s crimes from the starting-point of their ennui. The  neighborhood knows of the periods of this ennui, and the sinner thinks  that they are almost discovered if she is asked about them. Cherchez la  femme, cherchez l’amour; cherchez l’ennui; and hundreds of times you  find the solution.    Conceit, too, may be caused by hidden sexuality. We need only to use the  word denotatively, for when we speak of the conceit of a scholar, an  official, or a soldier, we mean properly the desire for fame, the  activity of getting oneself praised and recognized. Conceit proper is  only womanish or a property of feminine men, and just as, according to  Darwin, the coloration of birds, insects, and even plants serves only  the purposes of sexual selection and has, therefore, sexual grounds, so  also the conceit of woman has only sexual purpose. She is conceited for  men alone even though through the medium of other women. As Lotze wrote  in his “Mikrokosmus,” “Everything that calls attention to her person  without doing her any harm is instinctively used by woman as a means in  sexual conflict.” There is much truth in the terms “means” and “sexual  conflict.” The man takes the battle up directly, and if we deal with  this subject without frills we may not deny that animals behave just as  men do. The males battle directly with each other for the sake of the  females, who are compelled to study how to arouse this struggle for  their person, and thus hit upon the use of conceit in sexual conflict.  That women are conceited does not much matter to us criminal  psychologists; we know it and do not need to be told. But the forms in  which their conceit expresses itself are important; its consequences and  its relation to other conditions are important.    To make use of feminine conceit in the court-room is not an art but an  unpermissible trick which might lead too far. Whoever wants to succeed  with women, as Madame de Rieux says, “must bring their self-love into  play.” And St. Prospère: “Women are to be sought not through their  senses--their weakness is in their heart and conceit.” These properties  are, however, so powerful that they may easily lead to deception. If the  judge does not understand how to follow this prescription it does no  good, but if he does understand it he has a weapon with which woman may  be driven too far, and then wounded pride, anger, and even suggestion  work in far too vigorous a manner. For example, a woman wants to defend  her lover before the judge. Now, if the latter succeeds by the  demonstration of natural true facts in wounding her conceit, in  convincing her that she is betrayed, harmed, or forgotten by her  protected lover, or if she is merely made to believe this, she goes, in  most cases, farther than she can excuse, and accuses and harms him as  much as possible; tries, if she is able, to destroy him--whether rightly  or wrongly she does not care. She has lost her lover and nobody else  shall have him. “Feminine conceit,” says Lombroso, “explains itself  especially in the fact that the most important thing in the life of  woman is the struggle for men.” This assertion is strengthened by a long  series of examples and historical considerations and can serve as a  guiding thread in many labyrinthine cases. First of all, it is important  to know in many trials whether a woman has already taken up this  struggle for men, i.e., whether she has a lover, or wishes to have a  lover. If it can be shown that she has suddenly become conceited, or her  conceit has been really intensified, the question has an unconditionally  affirmative answer. Frequently enough one may succeed even in  determining the particular man, by ascertaining with certainty the time  at which this conceit first began, and whether it had closer or more  distant reference to some man. If these conditions, once discovered, are  otherwise at all confirmed, and there are no mistakes in observation,  the inference is inevitably certain.    We learn much concerning feminine conceit when we ask how a man could  have altered the inclination of a woman whose equal he in no sense was.  It is not necessary in such cases to fuss about the insoluble riddle of  the female heart and about the ever-dark secrets of the feminine soul.  Vulpes vult fraudem, lupus agnum, femina laudem--this illuminates every  profundity. The man in question knew how to make use of laudem--he knew  how to excite feminine conceit, and so vanquished others who were worth  much more than he.    This goes so far that by knowing the degree of feminine conceit we know  also the vivacity of feminine sexuality, and the latter is  criminologically important. Heinroth[266] says, “The feminine  individual, so long as it has demands to make, or believes itself to  have them, has utmost self-confidence. Conceit is the sexual  characteristic.” And we may add, “and the standard of sexuality.” As  soon as the child has the first ribbon woven into its hair, sexuality  has been excited. It increases with the love of tinsel and glitter and  dies when the aging female begins to neglect herself and to go about  unwashed. Woman lies when she asserts that everything is dead in her  heart, and sits before you neatly and decoratively dressed; she lies  when she says that she still loves her husband, and at the same time  shows considerable carelessness about her body and clothes; she lies  when she assures you that she has always been the same and her conceit  has come or gone. These statements constitute unexceptionable rules. The  use of them involves no possible error.    We have now the opportunity to understand what feminine knowledge is  worth and in what degree it is reliable. This is no place to discuss the  capacity of the feminine brain, and to venture into the dangerous field  which Schopenhauer and his disciples and modern anthropologists have  entered merely to quarrel in. The judge’s business is the concrete case  in which he must test the expressions of a woman when they depend upon  real or apparent knowledge, either just as he must test the testimony of  any other witness, or by means of experts. We shall therefore indicate  only the symptomatic value of feminine knowledge with regard to feminine  conceit. According to Lotze, women go to theater and to church only to  show their clothes and to appear artistic and pious; while M.  d’Arconville says, that women learn only that it may be said of them,  “They are scholars,” but for knowledge they care not at all.    This is important because we are likely, with regard to knowledge in the  deepest sense of the word, to be frequently unjust to women. We are  accustomed to suppose that the accumulation of some form of knowledge  must have some definite, hence causally related, connection with  purpose. We ask why the scholar is interested in his subject, why he has  sought this knowledge? And in most cases we find the right reason when  we have found the logical connection and have sought it logically. This  might have explained difficult cases, but not where the knowledge of  women is concerned. Women are interested in art, literature, and  science, mainly out of conceit, but they care also for hundreds of other  little things in order, by the knowledge of them, to show off as  scholars. Conceit and curiosity are closely related. Women therefore  often attain information that might cause them to be listed as suspects  if it could not be harmlessly explained by conceit. Conceit, however,  has itself to be explained by the struggle for men, because woman knows  instinctively that she can use knowledge in this struggle. And this  struggle for the other sex frequently betrays woman’s own crime, or the  crime of others. Somebody said that Eve’s first thought after eating the  apple was: “How does my fig-leaf fit?” It is a tasteful notion, that  Eve, who needed only to please her Adam, thought only of this after all  the sorrow of the first sin! But it is true, and we may imagine Eve’s  state of mind to be as follows: “Shall I now please him more or less?”  It is characteristic that the question about dress is said to have been  the _first_ question. It shows the power of conceit, the swiftness with  which it presses to the front. Indeed, of all crimes against property  half would have remained undiscovered if the criminals had been  self-controlled enough to keep their unjustly acquired gains dark for a  while. That they have not, constitutes the hope of every judge for the  discovery of the criminal, and the hope is greater with the extent of  the theft. It may be assumed that the criminal exhibits the fruits of  his crime, but that it is difficult to discover when there is not much  of it. This general rule is much more efficacious among women than  among men, for which reason a criminalist who suspects some person  thinks rather of arresting this person’s wife or mistress than himself.  When the apprentice steals something from his master, his girl gets a  new shawl, and that is not kept in the chest but immediately decorates  the shoulders of the girl. Indeed, women of the profoundest culture can  not wait a moment to decorate themselves with their new gauds, and we  hear that gypsies, who have been caught in some fresh crime, are  betrayed mainly by the fact that the women who had watched the house to  be robbed had been trying on bits of clothing while the men were still  inside cleaning the place up. What was most important for the women was  to meet the men already decorated anew when the men would finally come  back.    The old maid is, from the sexual standpoint, legally important because  she is in herself rather different from other women, and hence must be  differently understood. The properties assigned to these very pitiful  creatures are well-known. Many of the almost exclusively unpleasant  peculiarities assigned to them they may be said really to possess. The  old maid has failed in her natural function and thus exhibits all that  is implied in this accident; bitterness, envy, unpleasantness, hard  judgment of others’ qualities and deeds, difficulty in forming new  relationships, exaggerated fear and prudery, the latter mainly as  simulation of innocence. It is a well-known fact that every experienced  judge may confirm that old maids (we mean here, always, childless,  unmarried women of considerable age--not maids in the anatomical sense)  as witnesses, always bring something new. If you have heard ten  mutually-corroborating statements and the eleventh is made by an old  maid, it will be different. The latter, according to her nature, has  observed differently, introduces a collection of doubts and suggestions,  introduces nasty implications into harmless things, and if possible,  connects her own self with the matter. This is as significant as  explicable. The poor creature has not gotten much good out of life, has  never had a male protector, was frequently enough defenseless against  scorn and teasing, the amenities of social life and friendship were  rarely her portion. It is, therefore, almost inevitable that she should  see evil everywhere. If she has observed some quarrel from her window  she will testify that the thing was provoked in order to disturb her; if  a coachman has run over a child, she suggests that he had been driving  at her in order to frighten her; the thief who broke into her neighbor’s  house really wanted to break into hers because she is without  protection and therefore open to all attacks, so that it is conceivable  that he should want to hurt her. As a rule there will be other  witnesses, or the old maid will be so energetic in her testimonies that  her “perceptions” will not do much damage, but it is always wise to be  cautious.    Of course, there are exceptions, and it is well-known that exceptions  occur by way of extreme contrast. If an old maid does not possess the  unpleasant characteristics of her breed, she is extraordinarily kind and  lovable, in such a way generally, that her all too mild and rather blind  conceptions of an event make her a dangerous witness. It is also true  that old maids frequently are better educated and more civilized than  other women, as De Quincey shows. They are so because, without the care  of husband and children, they have time for all kinds of excellences,  especially when they are inclined thereto. It is notable that the  founders of women’s charitable societies are generally old maids or  childless widows, who have not had the joys and tasks of motherhood. We  must take care, therefore, in judging the kindness of a woman, against  being blinded by her philanthropic activity. That may be kindness, but  as a rule it may have its source in the lack of occupation, and in  striving for some form of motherhood. In judging old maids we deceive  ourselves still more easily because, as Darwin keenly noted, they always  have some masculine quality in their external appearance as well as in  their activity and feeling. Now that kind of woman is generally strange  to us. We start wrong when we judge her by customary standards and miss  the point when, in the cases of such old maids, we presuppose only  feminine qualities and overlook the very virile additions. We may add to  these qualities the intrinsic productivity of old maids. Benneke, in his  “Pragmatische Psychologie,” compares the activity of a very busy  housewife with that of an unmarried virgin, and thinks the worth of the  former to be higher, while the latter accomplishes more by way of  “erotic fancies, intrigues, inheritances, winnings in the lottery, and  hypochondriac complaints.” This is very instructive from the  criminological point of view. For the criminalist can not be too  cautious when he has an old maid to examine. Therefore, when a case  occurs containing characteristic intrigues, fanciful inheritances, and  winnings in the lottery, it will be well to seek out the old maid behind  these things. She may considerably help the explanation.    Both professional and popular judgment agree that the largest majority  of women have great fear of becoming old maids. We are told how this  fear expresses itself in foreign countries. In Spain, e.g., it is said  that a Spanish woman who has passed her first bloom takes the first  available candidate for her hand in order to avoid old-maidenhood; and  in Russia every mature girl who is able to do so, goes abroad for a  couple of years in order to return as “widow.” Everybody knows the  event, nobody asks for particulars about it. Some such process is  universal, and many an unfortunate marriage and allied crime may be  explained by it. Girls who at seventeen or eighteen were very particular  and had a right to be, are modest at twenty, and at twenty-six marry at  any price, in order not to remain old maids. That this is not  love-marriage and is often contrary to intelligence, is clear, and when  neither heart nor head rule, the devil laughs, and it is out of such  marriages that adultery, the flight of the wife, cruelty, robbery from  the spouse, and worse things, arise. Therefore it will be worth while to  study the history of the marriage in question. Was it a marriage in the  name of God, i.e., the marriage of an old maid? Then double caution must  be used in the study of the case.    There is some advantage in knowing the popular conception of when a girl  becomes an old maid, for old-maidenhood is a matter of a point of view;  it depends on the opinion of other people. Belles-lettres deals  considerably with this question, for it can itself determine the popular  attitude to the unmarried state. So Brandes discovers that the heroines  of classical novelists, of Racine, Shakespeare, Moliere, Voltaire,  Ariosto, Byron, Lesage, Scott, are almost always sixteen years of age.  In modern times, women in novels have their great love-adventure in the  thirties. How this advance in years took place we need not bother to  find out, but that it has occurred, we must keep in mind.    Before concluding the chapter on sexual conditions, we must say a word  about hysteria, which so very frequently has deceived the judge.  Hysteria was named by the ancients, as is known, from ἡ ὑστἑρα, the  womb,--and properly--for most of the causes of evil are there hidden.  The hysterics are legally significant in various ways. Their fixed ideas  often cause elaborate unreasonable explanations; they want to attract  attention, they are always concerned with themselves, are always wildly  enthusiastic about somebody else; often they persecute others with  unwarranted hatred, and they are the source of the coarsest  denunciations, particularly with regard to sexual crimes. Incidentally,  most of them are smart and have a diseased acuity of the senses. Hearing  and smell in particular, are sometimes remarkably alert, although not  always reliable, for hysterics frequently discover more than is there.  On the other hand, they often are useful because of their delicate  senses, and it is never necessary to show the correctness of their  perception out of hand. Bianchi rightly calls attention to the fact,  that hysterics like to write anonymous letters. Writers of these are  generally women, and mainly hysterical women; if a man writes them, he  is indubitably feminine in nature.    Most difficulties with hysterics occur when they suffer some  damage,[267] for they not only add a number of dishonest phenomena, but  also actually feel them. I might recall by way of example Domrich’s  story, that hysterics regularly get cramps laughing, when their feet get  cold. If this is true it is easy to conceive what else may happen.    All this, clearly, is a matter for the court physician, who alone should  be the proper authority when a hysteric is before the court. We lawyers  have only to know what significant dangers hysterics threaten, and  further, that the physician is to be called whenever one of them is  before us. Unfortunately there are no specific symptoms of hysteria  which the layman can make use of. We must be satisfied with the little  that has just been mentioned. Hysteria, I had almost said _fortunately_,  is nowadays so widespread that everybody has some approximate knowledge  of how it affects its victims.      (4) _Particular Feminine Qualities._      Section 70. (a) Intelligence.      Feminine intelligence properly deserves a separate section. Intelligence  is a function that has in both sexes some basis and purpose and proceeds  according to the same rules, but the meaning of intelligence must be  abandoned if we are to suppose it so rigid and so difficult to hold,  that the age-long differences between man and woman could have had no  influence on it. The fundamentally distinct bodies, the very different  occupations of both sexes, their different destinies, must have had  profound mutative influence on their intelligence. Moreover, we must  always start with a difference of attitude in the two sexes, in which  the purely positive belongs to one only, and we must see whether it is  not intensified by the negative of the other. When one body presses on  another the resulting impression is due, not only to the hardness of the  first, but also to the softness of the second, and when we hear about  the extraordinary wit of a woman we must blame the considerable idiocy  of the men she associates with. How many women are to be trusted for  intelligence, is a question of great importance for the criminalist,  inasmuch as right judgment depends on the attitude and good sense of the  witnesses, and must determine the value of the material presented us.    We wish to make no detailed sub-divisions in what follows. We shall  merely consider in their general aspects those functions which we are  accustomed to find in our own work.      Section 71. 1. Conception.    Concerning feminine sense-perception we have already spoken. There is no  significant difference between the two sexes, although in conceptual  power we find differences very distinct.    It may be generally said, as the daily life shows, that women conceive  differently from men. Whatever a dozen men may agree on conceptually,  will be differently thought of by any one woman. Now what is significant  in this fact is, that generally the woman is correct, that she has a  better conception,--and still under the same circumstances we continue  to conceive in the same way, even for the tenth time. This fact  demonstrates that a different form of organization, i.e., an essential  difference in nature, determines the character of conception in the two  sexes. If we compare values, the result will be different according to  sex, even with regard to the very material compared, or to the manner in  which it has been discovered. In the apprehension of situations, the  perception of attitudes, the judgment of people in certain relations, in  all that is called tact, i.e., in all that involves some abstraction or  clarification of confused and twisted material, and finally, in all that  involves human volitions, women are superior, and more reliable  individually, then ten men together. But the manner in which the woman  obtains her conception is less valuable, being the manner of pure  instinct. Or suppose that we call it more delicate feeling--the name  does not matter--the process is mainly unconscious, and is hence of less  value only, if I may say so, as requiring less thought. In consequence,  there is not only not a decrease in the utility of feminine testimony;  also its reliability is very great. There may be hundreds of errors in  the dialectical procedure of a man, while there is much more certainty  in the instinctive conception and the direct reproduction of a woman.  Hence, her statements are more reliable.    We need not call the source of this instinct God’s restitution for  feminine deficiency in other matters; we can show that it is due to  natural selection, and that the position and task of woman requires her  to observe her environment very closely. This need sharpened the inner  sense until it became unconscious conception. Feminine interest in the  environment is what gives female intuition a swiftness and certainty  unattainable in the meditations of the profoundest philosophers. The  swiftness of the intuition, which excludes all reflection, and which  merely solves problems, is the important thing. Woman perceives clearly,  as Spencer says somewhere, the mental status of her personal  environment; while Schopenhauer has incorrectly suggested that women  differ from men intellectually because they are lazy and want short-cuts  to attain their purpose. In point of fact, they do not want  short-cuts--they simply avoid complicated inference and depend upon  intuition, as they very safely may. Vision is possible only where  perception is possible, i.e., when things are near. The distant and the  veiled can not be seen, but must be inferred; hence, women let inference  alone and do what they can do better. This suggests the value of these  different interpretations of the feminine mode of conception. As lawyers  we may believe women where intuition is involved; where inference is a  factor we must be very careful. Sensory conception is to be understood  in the same way as intellectual conception. According to  Mantegazza,[268] woman has a particularly good eye for the delicate  aspects of things but has no capacity for seeing things on the horizon.  A remote, big object does not much excite her interest. This is  explained by the supposed fact that women as a rule can not see so far  as men, and are unable to distinguish the distant object so well. This  is no explanation because it would be as valid of all short-sighted  people. The truth is, that the definition of distant objects requires  more or less reason and inference. Woman does not reason and infer, and  if things miss her intuition, they do not exist for her.    Objectivity is another property that women lack. They tend always to  think in personalities, and they conceive objects in terms of personal  sympathies. Tell a woman about a case so that her interest will be  excited without your naming the individuals save as A and B, and it will  be impossible to get her to take a stand or to make a judgment. Who are  the people, what are they, how old are they, etc.? These questions must  be answered first. Hence the divergent feminine conceptions of a case  before and after the names are discovered. The personalizing tendency  results in some extraordinary things. Suppose a woman is describing a  brawl between two persons, or two groups. If the sides were equally  matched in strength and weapons, and if the witness in question did not  know any of the fighters before, she will nevertheless redistribute sun  and wind in her description if one of the brawlers happens accidentally  to have interested her, or has behaved in a “knightly” fashion, though  under other circumstances he might have earned only her dislike. In such  cases the fairy tale about telling mere facts recurs, and I have to  repeat that nobody tells mere facts--that judgment and inference always  enter into statements and that women use them more than men. Of course  real facts and inferred ones can be distinguished,--infrequently  however, and never with certainty. It is best, therefore, to determine  whether the witness bears any relation to one of the parties, and what  it is. And this relation will be an element in most cases inasmuch as  one rarely is present at a quarrel without some share in it. But even if  the latter case should occur, it is necessary, first of all, to hear  every detail so as to get the woman’s attitude clearly in mind. The  evidence of the woman’s mode of conception is of more importance than  the evidence concerning the fact itself. And finding the former is easy  enough if the woman is for a short time allowed to speak generally. When  her attitude is known, the standard for adjusting her excuses of one and  accusations of another, is easily discovered.    The same is true in purely individual cases. In the eyes of woman the  same crime committed by one man is black as hell; committed by another,  it is in all respects excusable. All that is necessary for this attitude  is the play of sympathies and antipathies generated from whatever  source. Just as the woman reader of romances favors one hero and hates  another, so the woman witness behaves toward her figures. And it may  happen that she finds one of them to have murdered with such “exciting  excellence,” and the victim to have been “such a boresome Philistine,”  that she excuses the crime. Caution is here the most necessary thing. Of  course women are not alone in taking such attitudes, but they are never  so clear, so typical, nor so determined as when taken by women.      Section 72. 2. Judgment.    Avenarius tells of an English couple who were speaking about angels’  wings. It was the man’s opinion that this angelic possession was  doubtful, the woman’s that it could not be. Many a woman witness has  reminded me of this story, and I have been able to explain by use of it  many an event. Woman says, “that must be” when she knows of no reason;  “that must be” when her own arguments bore her; “that must be” when she  is confused; when she does not understand the evidence of her opponent,  and particularly when she desires something. Unfortunately, she hides  this attitude under many words, and one often wishes for the simple  assertion of the English woman, “that must be.” In consequence, when we  want to learn their ratio sciendi from women, we get into difficulties.  They offer us a collection of frequently astonishing and important  things, but when we ask for the source of this collection we get “that  must be,” in variations, from a shrug of the shoulders to a flood of  words. The inexperienced judge may be deceived by the positiveness of  such expressions and believe that such certainty must be based on  something which the witness can not utter through lack of skill. If,  now, the judge is going to help the “unaided” witness with “of course  you mean because,” or “perhaps because,” etc., the witness, if she is  not a fool, will say “yes.” Thus we get apparently well-founded  assertions which are really founded on nothing more than “that must be.”    Cases dealing with divisions, distinctions and analysis rarely contain  ungrounded assertions by women. Women are well able to analyse and  explain data, and what one is capable of and understands, one succeeds  in justifying. Their difficulty is in synthetic work, in progressive  movement, and there they simply assert. The few observations of this  characteristic confirm this statement. For example, Lafitte says that at  medical examinations women are unable to do anything which requires  synthetic power. Women’s judgments of men further confirm this position,  for they are said to be more impressed with a minimal success, than with  a most magnificent effort. Now there is no injustice, no superficiality  in this observation; its object is simply parallel to their incapacity  for synthesis. Inasmuch as they are able to follow particular things  they will understand a single success, but the growth of efficiency  toward the future requires composition and wide horizon, hence they can  not understand it. Hence, also, the curious contradictions in women’s  statements as suspicion rises and falls. A woman, who to-day knows of a  hundred reasons for the guilt of some much-compromised prisoner, tries  to turn everything the other way when she later learns that the prisoner  has succeeded in producing some apparent alibi. So again, if the  prosecution seems to be successful, the women witnesses for the defence  often become the most dangerous for the defenders.    But here, also, women find a limit, perhaps because like all weaklings  they are afraid to draw the ultimate conclusions. As Leroux says in “De  l’Humanité,” “If criminals were left to women they would kill them all  in the first burst of anger, and if one waited until this burst had  subsided they would release them all.” The killing points to the easy  excitability, the passionateness, and the instinctive sense of justice  in women which demands immediate revenge for evil deeds. The liberation  points to the fact that women are afraid of every energetic deduction of  ultimate consequences, i.e., they have no knowledge of real justice.  “Men look for reasons, women judge by love; women can love and hate, but  they can not be just without loving, nor can they ever learn to value  justice.” So says Schiller, and how frequently do we not hear the  woman’s question whether the accused’s fate is going to depend on her  evidence. If we say yes, there is as a rule a restriction of testimony,  a titillation and twisting of consequences, and this circumstance must  always be remembered. If you want to get truth from a woman you must  know the proper time to begin, and what is more important, when to stop.  As the old proverb says, and it is one to take to heart: “Women are wise  when they act unconsciously; fools when they reflect.”    It is a familiar fact that women, committing crimes, go to extremes. It  may be correct to adduce, as modern writers do, the weakness of feminine  intelligence to social conditions, and it may, perhaps, be for this  reason that the future of woman lies in changing the feminine milieu.  But also with regard to environment she is an extremist. The most pious  woman, as Richelieu says, will not hesitate to kill a troublesome  witness. The most complicated crimes are characteristically planned by  women, and are frequently swelled with a number of absolutely  purposeless criminal deeds.    In this circumstance we sometimes find the explanation for an otherwise  unintelligible crime which, perhaps, indicates also, that the first  crime was committed by woman. It is as if she has in turpitude a certain  pleasure to which she abandons herself as soon as she has passed the  limit in her first crime.      Section 73. 3. Quarrels with Women.    This little matter is intended only for very young and inexperienced  criminal justices. There is nothing more exciting or instructive than a  quarrel with clever and trained women concerning worthy subjects; but  this does not happen in court, and ninety per cent. of our woman  witnesses are not to be quarrelled with. There are two occasions on  which a quarrel may arise. The first, when we are trying to show a  denying prisoner that her crime has already been proved and that her  denials are silly, and the second, when we are trying to show a witness  that she must know something although she refuses to know it, or when we  want to show her the incorrectness of her conclusion, or when we want to  lead her to a point where her testimony can have further value. Now a  verbal quarrel will hurt the case. This is a matter of ancient  experience, for whoever quarrels with women is, as Börne says, in the  condition of a man who must unceasingly polish lights.[269]    Women have an obstinacy, and it is no easy matter to be passive against  it. But in the interest of justice, the part of the wise is not to lose  any time by making an exhibition of himself through verbal quarrels with  women witnesses. The judge may be thoroughly convinced that his success  with the woman may help the case, but such success is very rare, and  when he thinks he has it, it is only apparent and momentary, or is  merely naïve self-deception. For women do like, for the sake of a  momentary advantage, to please men and to appear convinced, but the  judge for whom a woman does this is in a state that requires  consideration.    A few more particulars concerning feminine intelligence. They are,  however, only indirectly connected with it, and are as unintelligible as  the fact that left-handedness is more frequent and color-blindness less  frequent among women than among men. If, however, we are to explain  feminine intelligence at all we must do so by conceiving that women’s  intellectual functioning stops at a definite point and can not pass  beyond it.    Consider their attitude toward money. However distasteful Mammon may be  in himself, money is so important a factor in life itself that it is not  unintelligibly spoken of as the “majesty of cold cash.” But to make  incorrect use of an important thing is to be unintelligent. Whoever  wastes money is not intelligent enough to understand what important  pleasures he may provide for himself, and whoever hoards it does not  know its proper use. Now single women are either hoarders or wasters;  they rarely take the middle way and assume the prudence of the  housewife, which generally develops into miserliness. This is best  observable in the foolish bargaining of women at markets, in their  supposing that they have done great things by having reduced the price  of their purchase a few cents. Every dealer confirms the fact that the  first price he quotes a woman is increased in order to give her a chance  to bargain. But she does not bargain down to the proper price, she  bargains down to a sum above the proper price, and she frequently buys  unnecessary, or inferior things, simply because the dealer was smart  enough to captivate her by allowing reductions. This is indicated in a  certain criminal case,[270] in which the huckster-woman asserted that  she immediately suspected a customer of passing counterfeit coins  because she did not bargain.    Now this tendency to hoard is not essentially miserliness, for the chief  purpose of miserliness is to bring together and to own money; to enjoy  merely the look of it. This tendency is an unintelligent attitude toward  money, a failure to judge its value and properties. Now this failure is  one of the principal reasons for numerous crimes. A woman needing money  for her thousand several objects, demands it from her husband, and the  latter has to provide it without her asking whether he honestly can or  not. A wife is said to be uncurious only with regard to the source of  her husband’s money. She knows his income, she knows the necessary  annual expenses; she can immediately count up the fact that the two are  equal--but she calmly asks for more.    Of course, I am not referring to the courageous helpmeet who stands by  her husband in bearing the burdens of life. With her the criminalist has  nothing to do. I mean only those light-headed, pleasure-loving women,  who nowadays make the great majority, and that army of “lovers,” who  have cost the country a countless number of not unworthy men. The love  of women is the key to many a crime, even murder, theft, swindling, and  treachery. First, there is the woman’s unintelligible arithmetic, then  her ceaseless requirements, finally the man’s surrender to the limit of  his powers; then fresh demands, a long period of opposition, then  surrender, and finally one unlawful action. From that it is only a step  to a great crime. This is the simple theme of the countless variations  that are played in the criminal court. There are proverbs enough to show  how thoroughly the public understands this connection between love and  money.[271]    An apparently insignificant feminine quality which is connected with her  intelligence is her notorious, “never quite ready.” The criminalist  meets this when he is looking for an explanation of the failure of some  probably extraordinarily intelligent plan of crime. Or when a crime  occurs which might have been prevented by a step at the right minute,  women are always ten minutes behind the time. But these minutes would  not be gained if things were begun ten minutes earlier, and once a woman  suffers real damage through tardiness, she resolves to be ten minutes  ahead of time. But when she does so she fails in her resolution and this  failure is to be explained by lack of intelligence. The little fact that  women are never quite on time explains many a difficulty.    Feminine conservatism is as insignificant as feminine punctuality.  Lombroso shows how attached women are to old things. Ideas, jewelry,  verses, superstitions, and proverbs are better retained by women than by  men. Nobody would venture to assert that a conservative man must be less  intelligent than a liberal. Yet feminine conservatism indicates a  certain stupidity, less excitability and smaller capacity for accepting  new impressions. Women have a certain difficulty in assimilating and  reconstructing things, and because of this difficulty they do not like  to surrender an object after having received it. Hence, it is well not  to be too free with the more honorable attributes such as piety, love,  loyalty, respect to what they have already learned; closer investigation  discovers altogether too many instances of intellectual rigidity.    In our profession we meet the fact frequently that men pass much more  easily from honesty to dishonesty, and vice versa, that they more easily  change their habits, begin new plans, etc. Generalizations, of course,  can not be made; each case has to be studied on its merits. Yet, even  when questions of fact arise, e.g., in searching houses, it is well to  remember the distinction. Old letters, real corpora delicti, are much  more likely to be found in the woman’s box than in the man’s. The latter  has destroyed the thing long ago, but the former may “out of piety” have  preserved for years even the poison she once used to commit murder with.      Section 74. (b) Honesty.    We shall speak here only of the honesty of the sort of women the courts  have most to do with, and in this regard there is little to give us joy.  Not to be honest, and to lie, are two different things; the latter is  positive, the former negative, the dishonest person does not tell the  truth, the liar tells the untruth. It is dishonest to suppress a portion  of the truth, to lead others into mistakes, to fail to justify  appearances, and to make use of appearances. The dishonest person may  not have said a single untrue word and still have introduced many more  difficulties, confusions and deceptions than the liar. He is for this  reason more dangerous than the latter. Also, because his conduct is more  difficult to uncover and because he is more difficult to conquer than  the liar. Dishonesty is, however, a specially feminine characteristic,  and in men occurs only when they are effeminate. Real manliness and  dishonesty are concepts which can not be united. Hence, the popular  proverb says, “Women always tell the truth, but not the whole truth.”  And this is more accurate than the accusation of many writers, that  women lie. I do not believe that the criminal courts can verify the  latter accusation. I do not mean that women never lie--they lie  enough--but they do not lie more than men do, and none of us would  attribute lying to women as a sexual trait. To do so, would be to  confuse dishonesty with lying.    It would be a mistake to deal too sternly in court with the dishonesty  of women, for we ourselves and social conditions are responsible for  much of it. We dislike to use the right names of things and choose  rather to suggest, to remain in embarrassed silence, or to blush. Hence,  it is too much to ask that this round-aboutness should be set aside in  the courtroom, where circumstances make straight talking even more  difficult. According to Lombroso,[272] women lie because of their  weaknesses, and because of menstruation and pregnancy, for which they  have in conversation to substitute other illnesses; because of the  feeling of shame, because of the sexual selection which compels them to  conceal age, defects, diseases; because finally of their desire to be  interesting, their suggestibility, and their small powers of judgment.  All these things tend to make them lie, and then as mothers they have to  deceive their children about many things. Indeed, they are themselves no  more than children, Lombroso concludes. But it is a mistake to suppose  that these conditions lead to lying, for women generally acquire  silence, some other form of action, or the negative propagation of  error. But this is essentially dishonesty. To assert that deception,  lying, have become physiological properties of women is, therefore,  wrong. According to Lotze, women hate analysis and hence can not  distinguish between the true and the false, but then women hate  analysis only when it is applied to themselves. A woman does not want  to be analyzed herself simply because analysis would reveal a great deal  of dishonesty; she is therefore a stranger to thorough-going honest  activity. But for this men are to blame. Nobody, as Flaubert says, tells  women the truth. And when once they hear it they fight it as something  extraordinary. They are not even honest with themselves. But this is not  only true in general; it is true also in particular cases which the  court room sees. We ourselves make honesty difficult to women before the  court. Of course, I do not mean that to avoid this we are to be rude and  shameless in our conversation with women, but it is certain that we  compel them to be dishonest by our round-about handling of every  ticklish subject. Any half-experienced criminal justice knows that much  more progress can be made by simple and absolutely open discussion. A  highly educated woman with whom I had a frank talk about such a matter,  said at the end of this very painful sitting, “Thank God, that you spoke  frankly and without prudery--I was very much afraid that by foolish  questions you might compel me to prudish answers and hence, to complete  dishonesty.”    We have led women so far by our indirection that according to Stendhal,  to be honest, is to them identical with appearing naked in public.  Balzac asks, “Have you ever observed a lie in the attitude and manner of  woman? Deceit is as easy to them as falling snow in heaven.” But this is  true only if he means dishonesty. It is not true that it is easy for  women really to lie. I do not know whether this fact can be proven, but  I am sure the feminine malease in lying can be observed. The play of  features, the eyes, the breast, the attitude, betrays almost always even  the experienced female offender. Now, nothing can reveal the play of her  essential dishonesty. If a man once confesses, he confesses with less  constraint than a woman, and he is less likely, even if he is very bad,  to take advantage of false favorable appearances, while woman accepts  them with the semblance of innocence. If a man has not altogether given  a complete version, his failure is easy to recognize by his hesitation,  but the opinions of woman always have a definite goal, even though she  should tell us only a tenth of what she might know and say.    Even her simplest affirmation or denial is not honest. Her “no” is not  definite; e.g., her “no” to a man’s demands. Still further, when a man  affirms or denies and there is some limitation to his assertion. He  either announces it expressly or the more trained ear recognizes its  presence in the failure to conclude, in a hesitation of the tone. But  the woman says “yes” and “no,” even when only a small portion of one or  the other asserts a truth behind which she can hide herself, and this is  a matter to keep in mind in the courtroom.    Also the art of deception or concealment depends on dishonesty rather  than on pure deceit, because it consists much more in the use of  whatever is at hand, and in suppression of material, than on direct  lies. So, when the proverb says that a woman was ill only three times  during the course of the year, but each time for four months, it will be  unjust to say that she intentionally denies a year-long illness. She  does not, but as a matter of fact, she is ill at least thirteen times a  year, and besides, her weak physique causes her to feel frequently  unwell. So she does not lie about her illness. But then she does not  immediately announce her recovery and permits people to nurse and  protect her even when she has no need of it. Perhaps she does so  because, in the course of the centuries, she found it necessary to  magnify her little troubles in order to protect herself against brutal  men, and had, therefore, to forge the weapon of dishonesty. So  Schopenhauer agrees: “Nature has given women only one means of  protection and defence--hypocrisy; this is congenital with them, and the  use of it is as natural as the animal’s use of its claws. Women feel  they have a certain degree of justification for their hypocrisy.”    With this hypocrisy we have, as lawyers, to wage a constant battle.  Quite apart from the various ills and diseases which women assume before  the judge, everything else is pretended; innocence, love of children,  spouses, and parents; pain at loss and despair at reproaches; a breaking  heart at separation; and piety,--in short, whatever may be useful. This  subjects the examining justice to the dangers and difficulties of being  either too harsh, or being fooled. He can save himself much trouble by  remembering that in this simulation there is much dishonesty and few  lies. The simulation is rarely thorough-going, it is an intensification  of something actually there.    And now think of the tears which are wept before every man, and not  least, before the criminal judge. Popular proverbs tend to undervalue,  often to distrust tearful women. Mantegazza[273] points out that every  man over thirty can recall scenes in which it was difficult to determine  how much of a woman’s tears meant real pain, and how much was  voluntarily shed. In the notion that tears represent a mixture of poetry  and truth, we shall find the correct solution. It would be interesting  to question female virtuosos in tears (when women see that they can  really teach they are quite often honest) about the matter. The  questioner would inevitably learn that it is impossible to weep at will  and without reason. Only a child can do that. Tears require a definite  reason and a certain amount of time which may be reduced by great  practice to a minimum, but even that minimum requires some duration.  Stories in novels and comic papers in which women weep bitterly about a  denied new coat, are fairy tales; in point of fact the lady begins by  feeling hurt because her husband refused to buy her the thing, then she  thinks that he has recently refused to buy her a dress, and to take her  to the theatre; that at the same time he looks unfriendly and walks away  to the window; that indeed, she is really a pitiful, misunderstood,  immeasurably unhappy woman, and after this crescendo, which often occurs  presto prestissimo, the stream of tears breaks through. Some tiny  reason, a little time, a little auto-suggestion, and a little  imagination,--these can keep every woman weeping eternally, and these  tears can always leave us cold. Beware, however, of the silent tears of  real pain, especially of hurt innocence. These must not be mistaken for  the first. If they are, much harm may be done, for these tears, if they  do not represent penitence for guilt, are real evidences of innocence. I  once believed that the surest mark of such tears was the deceiving  attempt to beat down and suppress them; an attempt which is made with  elementary vigor. But even this attempt to fight them off is frequently  not quite real.    As with tears, so with fainting. The greater number of fainting fits are  either altogether false, or something between fainting and wakefulness.  Women certainly, whether as prisoners or witnesses, are often very  uncomfortable in court, and if the discomfort is followed immediately by  illness, dizziness, and great fear, fainting is natural. If only a  little exaggeration, auto-suggestion, relaxation, and the attempt to  dodge the unpleasant circumstance are added, then the fainting fit is  ready to order, and the effect is generally in favor of the fainter.  Although it is wrong to assume beforehand that fainting is a comedy, it  is necessary to beware of deception.    An interesting question, which, thank heaven, does not concern the  criminal justice, is whether women can keep their word. When a  criminalist permits a woman to promise not to tell anybody else of her  testimony, or some similar naïveté, he may settle his account with his  conscience. The criminalist must not accept promises at all, and he is  only getting his reward when women fool him. The fact is, that woman  does not know the definite line between right and wrong. Or better, she  draws the line in a different way; sometimes more sharply, but in the  main more broadly than man, and in many cases she does not at all  understand that certain distinctions are not permitted. This occurs  chiefly where the boundaries are really unstable, or where it is not  easy to understand the personality of the sufferer. Hence, it is always  difficult to make woman understand that state, community, or other  public weal, must in and for themselves be sacred against all harm. The  most honest and pious woman is not only without conscience with regard  to dodging her taxes, she also finds great pleasure in having done so  successfully. It does not matter what it is she smuggles, she is glad to  smuggle successfully, but smuggling is not, as might be supposed, a  sport for women, though women need more nervous excitement and sport  than men. Their attitude shows that they are really unable to see that  they are running into danger because they are violating the law. When  you tell them that the state is justified in forbidding smuggling, they  always answer that they have smuggled such a very little, that nobody  would miss the duties. Then the interest in smugglers and  smuggling-stories is exceedingly great. We once had a girl who was born  on the boundary between Italy and Austria. Her father was a notorious  smuggler, the chief of a band that brought coffee and silk across the  border. He grew rich in the trade, but he lost everything in an  especially great venture, and was finally shot by the customs-officers  at the boundary. If you could see with what interest, spirit, and  keenness the girl described her father’s dubious courses you would  recognize that she had not the slightest idea that there was anything  wrong in what he was doing.    Women, moreover, do not understand the least regulation. I frequently  have had cases in which even intelligent women could not see why it was  wrong to make a “small” change in a public register; why it was wrong to  give, in a foreign city, a false name at the hotel; or why the police  might forbid the shaking of dust-cloths over the heads of pedestrians,  even from her “own” house; why the dog must be kept chained; and what  good such “vexations” could do, anyway.    Again, tiny bits of private property are not safe from women. Note how  impossible it is to make women understand that private property is  despoiled when flowers or fruit are plucked from a private garden. The  point is so small, and as a rule, the property owner makes no  objections, but it must be granted that he has the right to do so. Then  their tendency to steal, in the country, bits of ground and boundaries  is well known. Most of the boundary cases we have, involved the activity  of some woman.    Even in their own homes women do not conceive property too rigidly. They  appropriate pen, paper, pencils, clothes, etc., without having any idea  of replacing what they have taken away. This may be confirmed by anybody  whose desk is not habitually sacrosanct, and he will agree that it is  not slovenliness, but defective sense of property that causes women to  do this, for even the most consummate housekeepers do so. This defective  property-sense is most clearly shown in the notorious fact that women  cheat at cards. According to Lombroso, an educated, much experienced  woman told him in confidence that it is difficult for her sex not to  cheat at cards. Croupiers in gambling halls know things much worse. They  say that they must watch women much more than men because they are not  only more frequent cheaters, but more expert. Even at croquet and  lawn-tennis girls are unspeakably smart about cheating if they can  thereby put their masculine opponents impudently at a disadvantage.    We find many women among swindlers, gamblers, and counterfeiters; and  moreover, we have the evidence of experienced housewives, that the  cleverest and most useful servants are frequently thievish. What is  instructive in all these facts is the indefiniteness of the boundary  between honesty and dishonesty, even in the most petty cases. The defect  in the sense of property with regard to little things explains how many  a woman became a criminal--the road she wandered on grew, step by step,  more extended. There being no definite boundary, it was inevitable that  women should go very far, and when the educated woman does nothing more  than to steal a pencil from her husband and to cheat at whist, her sole  fortune is that she does not get opportunities or needs for more serious  mistakes. The uneducated, poverty-stricken woman has, however, both  opportunity and need, and crime becomes very easy to her. Our life is  rich in experiment and our will too weak not to fail under the  exigencies of existence, if, at the outset, a slightest deviation from  the straight and narrow road is not avoided. If the justice is in doubt  whether a woman has committed a great crime against property, his study  will concern, not the deed, but the time when the woman was in  different circumstances and had no other opportunity to do wrong than  mere nibbling at and otherwise foolish abstractions from other people’s  property. If this inclination can be proved, then there is justification  for at least suspecting her of the greater crime.    The relation of women to such devilment becomes more instructive when it  has to be discovered through woman witnesses. As a rule, there is no  justification for the assumption that people are inclined to excuse  whatever they find themselves guilty of. On the contrary, we are  inclined to punish others most harshly where we ourselves are most  guilty. And there is still another side to the matter. When an honest,  well-conducted woman commits petty crimes, she does not consider them as  crimes, she is unaware of their immorality, and it would be illogical  for her to see as a crime in others that which she does not recognize as  a crime in herself. It is for this reason that she tends to excuse her  neighbor’s derelictions. Now, when we try to find out from feminine  witnesses facts concerning the objects on which we properly lay stress,  they do not answer and cause us to make mistakes. What woman thinks is  mere “sweet-tooth” in her servant girl, is larceny in criminal law; what  she calls “pin-money,” we call deceit, or violation of trust; for the  man whom the woman calls “the dragon,” we find in many cases quite  different terms. And this feminine attitude is not Christian charity,  but ignorance of the law, and with this ignorance we have to count when  we examine witnesses. Of course, not only concerning some theft by a  servant girl, but always when we are trying to understand some human  weakness.    From honesty to loyalty is but a step. Often these traits lie side by  side or overlap each other. Now, the criminal justice has, more  frequently than appears, to deal with feminine loyalty. Problems of  adultery are generally of subordinate significance only, but this  loyalty or disloyalty often plays the most important rôle in trials of  all conceivable crimes, and the whole problem of evidence takes a  different form according to the assumption that this loyalty does, or  does not, exist. Whether it is the murder of a husband, doubtful  suicide, physical mutilation, theft, perversion of trust, arson, the  case takes a different form if feminine disloyalty can be proved. The  rare reference to this important premise in the presentation of evidence  is due to the fact that we are ignorant of its significance, that its  determinative factors are hidden, and finally that its presentation is  as a rule difficult.    Public opinion on feminine loyalty is not flattering. Diderot asserts  that there is no loyal woman who has not ceased being so, at least, in  her imagination. Of course this does not mean much, for all of us have  ideally committed many sins, but if Diderot is right, one may assume a  feminine inclination to disloyalty. Most responsible for this is, of  course, the purely sexual character of woman, but we must not do her the  injustice, and ourselves the harm, of supposing that this character is  the sole regulative principle; the illimitable feminine need for change  is also responsible to a great degree. I doubt whether it could be  proved in any collection of cases worth naming that a woman grew  disloyal although her sexual needs were small; but that her sex does so  is certain, and thence we must seek other reasons for their disloyalty.  The love of change is fundamental and may be observed in recorded  criminal cases. “Even educated women,” says Goltz,[274] “can not bear  continuous and uniform good fortune, and feel an inconceivable impulse  to devilment and foolishness in order to get some variety in life.” Now  it will be much easier for the judge to determine whether the woman in  the case had at the critical time an especial inclination to this  “devilment,” than to discover whether her own husband was sexually  insufficient, or whatever similar secrets might be involved.    If woman, however, once has the impulse to seek variety, and the  harmless and permissible changes she may provide herself are no longer  sufficient or are lacking, the movement of her daily life takes a  questionable direction. Then there is a certain tendency to deceit which  is able to bring its particular consequences to bear. A woman has  married, let us say, for love, or for money, for spite, to please her  parents, etc., etc. Now come moments in her life in which she reflects  concerning “her” reason for marriage, and the cause of these moments  will almost always be her husband, i.e., he may have been ill-mannered,  have demanded too much, have refused something, have neglected her,  etc., and thus have wounded her so that her mood, when thinking of the  reason of her marriage, is decidedly bad, and she begins to doubt  whether her love was really so strong, whether the money was worth the  trouble, whether she ought not to have opposed her parents, etc. And  suppose she had waited, might she not have done better? Had she not  deserved better? Every step in her musing takes her farther from her  husband. A man is nothing to a woman to whom he is not everything, and  if he is nothing he deserves no especial consideration, and if he is  undeserving, a little disloyalty is not so terrible, and finally, the  little disloyalty gradually and naturally and smoothly leads to  adultery, and adultery to a chain of crimes. That this process is not a  thousand times more frequent, is merely due to the accident that the  right man is not at hand during these so-called weak moments. Millions  of women who boast of their virtue, and scorn others most nobly, have to  thank their boasted virtue only to this accident. If the right man had  been present at the right time they would have had no more ground for  pride. There is only a simple and safe method for discovering whether a  woman is loyal to her husband--lead her to say whether her husband  neglects her. Every woman who complains that her husband neglects her is  an adulteress or in the way of becoming one, for she seeks the most  thrifty, the really sound reason which would justify adultery. How close  she has come to this sin is easily discoverable from the degree of  intensity with which she accuses her husband.    Besides adultery, the disloyalty of widow and of bride, there is also  another sense in which disloyalty may be important. The first is  important only when we have to infer some earlier condition, and we are  likely to commit injustice if we judge the conduct of the wife by the  conduct of the widow. As a rule there are no means of comparison. In  numerous cases the wife loves her husband and is loyal to him even  beyond the grave, but these cases always involve older women whom lust  no longer affects. If the widow is at all young, pretty, and  comparatively rich, she forgets her husband. If she has forgotten him,  if after a very short time she has again found a lover and a husband,  whether for “the sake of the poor children,” or because “my first one,  of blessed memory, desired it,” or because “the second and the first  look so much alike,” or whatever other reason she might give, there is  still no ground for supposing that she did not love her first husband,  was disloyal to him, robbed and murdered him. She might have borne the  happiest relations with him; but he is dead, and a dead man is no man.  There are, again, cases in which the almost immediate marriage of a  new-made widow implies all kinds of things, and often reveals in the  person of the second husband the murderer of the first. When suspicions  of such a situation occur, it is obviously necessary to go very slowly,  but the first thing of importance is to keep tabs carefully on the  second husband. It is exceedingly self-contradictory in a man to marry a  woman he knows to have murdered her first husband--but if he had cared  only about being her lover there would not have been the necessity of  murdering the first.    The opposite of this type is anticipatory disloyalty of a woman who  marries a man in order to carry on undisturbed her love-affair with  another. That there are evil consequences in most cases is easy to see.  Such marriages occur very frequently among peasants. The woman, e.g., is  in love with the son of a wealthy widower. The son owns nothing, or the  father refuses his permission, so the woman makes a fool of the father  by marrying him and carries on her amour with the son, doubly sinful.  Instead of a son, the lover may be only a servant, and then the couple  rob the husband thoroughly--especially if the second wife has no  expectations of inheritance, there being children of a former marriage.  Variations on this central theme occur as the person of the lover  changes to neighbor, cousin, friend, etc., but the type is obvious, and  it is necessary to consider its possibilities whenever suspicion arises.    The disloyalty of a bride--well, we will not bother with this poetical  subject. Everybody knows how merciless a girl can be, how she leaves her  lover for practical, or otherwise ignoble reasons, and everybody knows  the consequences of such things.[275]      Section 75. (c) Love, Hate and Friendship.    If Emerson is right and love is no more than the deification of persons,  the criminalist does not need to bother about this very rare paroxysm of  the human soul. We might translate, at most, a girl’s description of her  lover who is possibly accused of some crime, from deified into human,  but that is all. However, we do not find that sort of love in the law  courts. The love we do find has to be translated into a simpler and more  common form than that of the poet. The sense of self-sacrifice, with  which Wagner endows his heroines, is not altogether foreign in our work;  we find it among the lowest proletarian women, who immolate themselves  for their husbands, follow them through the most tremendous distress,  nurse and sustain them with hungry heroism. This is more remarkable than  poetical self-sacrifice, but it is also different and is to be  differently explained. The conditions which cause love can be understood  in terms of the effects and forces of the daily life. And where we can  not see it differently we shall be compelled to speak of it as if it  were a disease. If disease is not sufficient explanation, we shall have  to say with the Italians, “l’amore é une castigo di Dio.”    Love is of greater importance in the criminal court than the statutes  allow, and we frequently make great mistakes because we do not count it  in. We have first of all to do our duty properly, to distinguish the  biological difference between the human criminal and the normal human  being, rather than to subsume every criminal case under its proper  statute. When a woman commits a crime because of jealousy, when in spite  of herself she throws herself away on a good-for-nothing; when she  fights her rival with unconquerable hatred; when she bears unbelievable  maltreatment; when she has done hundreds of other things--who counts her  love? She is guilty of crime; she is granted to have had a motive; and  she is punished. Has enough been done when the jury acquits a jealous  murderess, or a thrower of vitriol? Such cases are spectacular, but no  attention is paid to the love of the woman in the millions of little  cases where love, and love only, was the impulse, and the statute  sentencing her to so and so much punishment was the outcome.    Now, study the maniacally-clever force of jealousy and then ask who is  guilty of the crime. Augustine says, that whoever is not jealous is not  in love, and if love and jealousy are correlate, one may be inferred  from the other. What is at work is jealousy, what is to to be shown is  love. That is, the evil in the world is due to jealousy, but this cause  would be more difficult to prove than its correlate, love. And we know  how difficult it is to conceal love,--so difficult that it has become a  popular proverb that when a woman has a paramour, everybody knows it but  her husband. Now, if a crime has been committed through jealousy it  would be simply naïve to ask whether the woman was jealous. Jealousy is  rare to discover and unreliable, while her love-affair is known to  everybody. Once this becomes an established fact, we can determine also  the degree of her jealousy.    Woman gives the expression of her jealousy characteristic direction. Man  attempts to possess his wife solely and without trouble, and hence is  naturally jealous. The deceived woman turns all her hatred on her rival  and she excuses the husband if only she believes that she still  possesses, or has regained his love. It will therefore be a mistake to  suppose that because a woman has again begun to love her husband,  perhaps after a long-enduring jealousy, that no such jealousy preceded  or that she had forgiven her rival. It may be that she has come to an  understanding with her husband and no longer cares about the rival, but  this is only either mere semblance or temporary, for the first suspicion  of danger turns loose the old jealousy with all its consequences. Here  again her husband is safe and all her rage is directed upon her rival.  The typical cases are those of the attacks by abandoned mistresses at  the weddings of their lovers. They always tear the wreath and veil from  the bride’s head, but it never is said that they knock the groom’s  top-hat off.    Another characteristic of feminine love which often causes difficulties  is the passion with which the wife often gives herself to her husband.  Two such different authors as Kuno Fischer and George Sand agree to this  almost verbatim. The first says: “What nature demands of woman is  complete surrender to man,” and the second: “Love is a voluntary slavery  for which woman craves by nature.” Here we find the explanation of all  those phenomena in which the will of the wife seems dead beside that of  the husband. If a woman once depends on a man she follows him  everywhere, and even if he commits the most disgusting crimes she helps  him and is his loyalest comrade. We simply catalogue the situation as  complicity, but we have no statutes for the fact that the woman  naturally could do nothing else. We do not find it easy to discover the  accomplices of a man guilty of a crime, but if there is a woman who  really loves him we may be sure that she is one of them.    For the same reason women often bear interminably long maltreatment at  the hands of their husbands or lovers. We think of extraordinary  motives, but the whole thing is explained if the motive was really  feminine love. It will be more difficult for us to believe in this love  when the man is physically and mentally not an object of love. But the  motives of causes of love of woman for man, though much discussed, have  never been satisfactorily determined. Some authorities make strength and  courage the motives, but there are innumerable objections, for historic  lovers have been weak and cowardly, intellectual rather than foolish,  though Schopenhauer says, that intelligence and genius are distasteful  to women. No fixed reasons can be assigned. We have to accept the fact  that a most disgusting man is often loved by a most lovely woman. We  have to believe that love of man turns women from their romantic ideals.  There has been the mistaken notion that only a common crime compels a  woman to remain loyally with a thoroughly worthless man, and again, it  has been erroneously supposed that a certain woman who refused a most  desirable heirloom left her by a man, must have known of some great  crime committed by him. But we need no other motive for this action than  her infinite love, and the reason of that infinity we find in the nature  of that love. It is, in fact, woman’s life, whereas it is an episode in  the life of man. Of course, we are not here speaking of transitory  inclinations, or flirtations, but of that great and profound love which  all women of all classes know, and this love is overmastering; it  conquers everything, it forgives everything, it endures everything.    There is still another inexplicable thing. Eager as man is to find his  woman virgin, woman cares little about the similar thing in man. Only  the very young, pure, inexperienced girl feels an instinctive revulsion  from the real roué, but other women, according to Rochebrune, love a man  in proportion to the number of other women who love or have loved him.  This is difficult to understand, but it is a fact that a man has an easy  task with women if he has a reputation of being a great hand with them.  Perhaps this ease is only an expression of the conceit and envy of  women, who can not bear the idea that a man is interested in so many  others and not in themselves. As Balzac says, “women prefer most to win  a man who already belongs to another.” The inconceivable ease with which  certain types of men seduce women, and at whose heads women throw  themselves in spite of the fact that these men have no praiseworthy  qualities whatever, can only be so explained. Perhaps it is true, as is  sometimes said, that here is a case of sexuality expressing itself in an  inexplicable manner.    Of course there are friendships between men and women, although such  friendships are very rare. There is no doubt that sexual interests tend  easily to dominate such relations. We suppose them to be rare just  because their existence requires that sexual motives be spontaneously  excluded. There are three types of such friendships. 1. When the age of  the friends is such as to make the suspicion of passion impossible. 2.  When from earliest childhood, for one reason or another, a purely  fraternal relationship has developed. 3. When both are of such nature  that the famous divine spark can not set them afire. Whether there is an  electrical influence between couples, as some scientists say, or not, we  frequently see two people irrationally select each other, as if  compelled by some evil force. Now this selection may result in nothing  more than a friendship. Such friendships are frequently claimed in  trials, and of course, they are never altogether believed in. The  necessary thing in treating these cases is caution, for it will be  impossible to prove these friendships unlikely, and hence unjust to deny  them without further evidence. It will be necessary to discover whether  the sexual interest is or can be excluded. If not, the friendship is  purely a nominal one.    Friendship between women is popularly little valued. Comedies, comic  papers, and criticisms make fun of it, and we have heard all too often  that the news of the first gray hair, or the disloyalty of a husband,  has its starting-point in a woman friend, and that women decorate  themselves and improve themselves in order to worry their friends. One  author wanted to show that friendships between two women were only  conspiracies against a third, and Diderot said that there is a secret  union among women as among priests of one and the same religion--they  hate each other, but they protect each other. The latter fact we see  frequently enough in the examination of women witnesses. Envy, dislike,  jealousy, and egoism play up vividly, and he is a successful judge who  can discover how much of the evidence is born of these motives. But  beyond a certain point, women co-operate. This point is easy to find,  for it is placed where-ever feminine qualities are to be generalized. So  long as we stick, during an examination, to a concrete instance, and so  long as the witness observes no combination of her conduct and opinions  with that of the object of her testimony, she will allow herself to be  guided partly by the truth, partly by her opinions of the woman in  question. But just as soon as we expressly or tacitly suggest common  feminine qualities, or start to speak of some matter in which the  witness herself feels guilty, she turns about and defends where before  she had been attacking. In these cases we must try to find out whether  we have become “general.” If we have, we know why the witness is  defending the accused.    We may say the same things of feminine hate that we have said of  feminine love. Love and hate are only the positive and negative aspects  of the same relation. When a woman hates you she has loved you, does  love you, or will love you,--this is a reliable rule for the many cases  in which feminine hatred gives the criminalist work. Feminine hatred is  much intenser than masculine hatred. St. Gregory says that it is worse  than the devil’s, for the devil acts alone while woman gets the devil to  help her, and Stolle believes that a woman seeking revenge is capable of  anything. We have here to remember that among women of the lower  classes, hate, anger, and revenge are only different stages of the same  emotion. Moreover, nobody finds greater joy in revenge than a woman.  Indeed I might say that revenge and the pursuit of revenge are  specifically feminine. The real, vigorous man is not easily turned  thereto. In woman, it is connected with her greater sensibility which  causes anger, rage, and revenge to go further than in men. Lombroso has  done most to show this, and Mantegazza cites numberless examples of the  superior ease with which woman falls into paroxysms of rage. Hence, when  some crime with revenge as motive is before us, and we have no way of  getting at the criminal, our first suspicion should be directed toward a  woman or an effeminate man. Further, when we have to make an orderly  series of inferences, we will start from this proposition into the past,  present, and future, and shall not have much to wonder at if the  successful vengeance far exceeds its actual or fanciful occasion, and  if, perhaps, a very long time has elapsed before its accomplishment.  Nulla irae super iram mulieris.    Feminine cruelty is directly connected with feminine anger and hatred.  Lombroso has already indicated how fundamental woman’s inclination to  cruelty is. The cases are well known, together with the frequent and  remarkable combination of real kindness of heart with real bestiality.  Perhaps it would be proper to conceive this cruelty as a form of  defence, or the expression of defence, for we often find cruelty and  weakness paired elsewhere, as among children, idiots, etc. It is  particularly noticeable among cretins in the Alps. The great danger of  the cretin’s anger is well known there. Once, one of these unfortunates  was tortured to death by another because he thought that his victim had  received from the charitable monks a larger piece of bread than he.  Another was killed because he had received a gift of two trousers  buttons. These instances, I should think, indicate the real connection  between cruelty and weakness. Cruelty is a means of defence, and hence  is characteristic of the weaker sex. Moreover, many a curious bit of  feminine cruelty is due to feminine traits misunderstood, suppressed,  but in themselves good. Just as we know that frugality and a tendency to  save in housekeeping may often lead to dishonesty, so we perceive that  these qualities cause cruelty to servants, and even the desire to put  out of the way old and troublesome relatives who are eating the bread  that belongs to husband and children.    These facts serve not only to explain the crime, but to reveal the  criminal. If we succeed, other things being equal, in adducing a number  of feminine characteristics with one of which the cruelty of the crime  may be connected and explained, we have a clew to the criminal. The  instances mentioned,--the motherly care of house and family, frugality,  miserliness, hardness to servants, cruelty to aged parents,--seem rare  and not altogether rational, yet they occur frequently and give the  right clew to the criminal. There are still other similar combinations.  Everybody knows feminine love for trials at court, for the daily paper’s  reports of them, and for public executions. While the last were still  common in Austria, newspapers concluded regularly with the statement  that the “tender” sex was the great majority of the crowd that witnessed  them. At public executions women of the lower class; at great trials,  women of the higher classes, make up the auditors and spectators. Here  the movement from eagerness, curiosity, through the desire for vigorous  nervous stimulation, to hard-heartedness and undeniable cruelty, is  clear enough.    There would be nothing for us to do with this fact if we had not to deal  with the final expression of cruelty, i.e., murder; especially the  specifically feminine forms of murder,--child-murder and poisoning.  These, of course, in particular the former, involve abnormal conditions  which are subjects for the physician. At the same time it is the judge  who examines and sentences, and he is required to understand these  conditions and to consider every detail that may help him in drawing his  conclusion.    That poisoning is mainly a feminine crime is a familiar fact of which  modern medico-legal writers have spoken much; even the ancient authors,  not medical, like Livy, Tacitus, etc., have mentioned it. It is  necessary, therefore, carefully to study the feminine character in order  to understand how and why women are given to this form of murder. To do  so we need consider, however, only the ordinary factors of the daily  life; the extraordinary conditions, etc., are generally superfluous.    Every crime that is committed is committed when the reasons for doing it  outweigh the reasons for not doing it. This is true even of passional  crimes, for a _pro_ and _contra_ must have presented themselves in spite  of the lightninglike swiftness of the act. One appeared and then the  other, the _pro_ won and the deed was done. In other crimes this  conflict lasts at least so long as to be definitely observable, and in  the greater crimes it will, as a rule, take more time and more motive.  The principles of good and of evil will really battle with each other,  and when the individual is so depraved as no longer to have good  principles, their place is taken by fear of discovery and punishment,  and by the question whether the advantage to be gained is worth the  effort, etc. The commission of the crime is itself evidence that the  reasons for it were all-powerful. Now suppose that a woman gets the idea  of killing somebody. Here for a time _pro_ and _contra_ will balance  each other, and when the latter are outweighed she will think that she  _must_ commit murder. If she does not think so she will not do so. Now,  every murder, save that by poison, requires courage, the power to do,  and physical strength. As woman does not possess these qualities, she  spontaneously makes use of poison. Hence, there is nothing extraordinary  or significant in this fact, it is due to the familiar traits of woman.  For this reason, when there is any doubt as to the murderer in a case of  poisoning, it is well to think first of a woman or of a weak, effeminate  man.    The weakness of woman will help us in still another direction. It is  easily conceivable that all forms of weakness will seek support and  assistance, whether physical or moral. The latter is inclined in cases  of need to make use, also, of such assistance as may be rendered by  personal inward reflection. Now this reflection may be on the one hand,  dissuasion, on the other hand persuasion, self-persuasion; the first  subduing self-reproach, the latter, fear of discovery. Hence, a woman  will try to persuade not only herself, but others also that she was  justified in her course and will assign as reason, bad treatment. Now  there might have been some bad treatment, but it will have been altered  and twisted so utterly as to lose its original form and to become  imaginatively unbearable. Thus, a series of conclusions from the  reactions of the suspect to her environment may be easily found, and  these are the more convincing if they have occurred within a rather long  period of time, in which they may be chronologically arranged, and from  which a slow and definite intensification, usque ad ultimum, can be  proved. Such an analysis is, of course, troublesome, but if done  systematically, almost always rich in results.    The tricks of persuasion which are to suppress the fears of discovery  are always helps of another sort. As a rule they are general, and point  to the fact that the crime contemplated had occurred before without  danger, that everything was intelligently provided for, etc. Now these  circumstances are less dangerous, but they require consideration when  they count on certain popular views, especially superstitions and  certain customs and assumptions. Suppose, for example, that a young wife  wants to get rid of her old husband whom she had married for the sake  of his money. Now certain proverbs point to the fact that old men who  marry young women die soon after marriage. This popular view may be  entirely justified in the fact that the complete alteration in the mode  of life, the experience of uncustomary things, the excitement, the  extreme tension, then the effort _in venere_, finally, perhaps also the  use of popularly well-known stimulants, etc., may easily cause  weakening, sickening, and as conclusion the death of the old man. But  the public does not draw this kind of inference, it simply assumes,  without asking the reason, that when an old man marries a young woman,  he dies. Therefore a young wife may easily think, “If I make use of  poison nobody will wonder, nobody will see anything suspicious about the  death. It is only an event which is universally supposed to happen. The  old man died because he married me.” Such ideas may easily seduce an  uneducated woman and determine her conduct. Of course, they are not  subject to observation, but they are not beyond control, if the popular  views concerning certain matters are known as the views which determine  standards. Therefore their introduction into the plot of the suspect may  help us in drawing some useful inference.[276]    With regard to child-murder the consideration of psychopathic conditions  need not absolutely be undertaken. Whether they are present must, of  course, be determined, and therefore it is first of all necessary to  learn the character of the suspect’s conduct. The opportunity for this  is given in any text-book on legal medicine, forensic psychopathology,  and criminal psychology. There are a good many older authors.[277] Most  of the cases cited by authorities show that women in the best of  circumstances have behaved innumerable times in such a way that if they  had been poor girls child-murder would immediately have been assumed.  Again, they have shown that the sweetest and most harmless creatures  become real beasts at the time of accouchement, or shortly after it  develop an unbelievable hatred toward child and husband. Many a  child-murder may possibly be explained by the habit of some animals of  consuming their young immediately after giving birth to them. Such cases  bind us in every trial for child-murder to have the mental state of the  mother thoroughly examined by a psychiatrist, and to interpret  everything connected with the matter as psychologist and humanitarian.  At the same time it must not be forgotten that one of the most dangerous  results is due to this attitude. Law-makers have without further  consideration kept in mind the mental condition of the mother and have  made child-murder much less punishable than ordinary murder. It is  inferred, therefore, that it is unnecessary to study the conditions  which cause it. This is dangerous, because it implies the belief that  the case is settled by giving a minimum sentence, where really an  infinity of grades and differences may enter. The situation that the  law-maker has studied is one among many, the majority of which we have  yet to apprehend and to examine.      Section 76. (d) Emotional Disposition and Related Subjects.    Madame de Krüdener writes in a letter to Bernardin de St. Pierre: “Je  voulais être sentie.” These laconic words of this wise pietist give us  an insight into the significance of emotional life of woman. Man wants  to be understood, woman felt. With this emotion she spoils much that man  might do because of his sense of justice. Indeed, a number of qualities  which the woman uses to make herself noted are bound up with her  emotional life, more or less. Compassion, self-sacrifice, religion,  superstition,--all these depend on the highly developed, almost diseased  formation of her emotional life. Feminine charity, feminine activity as  a nurse, feminine petitions for the pardon of criminals, infinite other  samples of women’s kindly dispositions must convince us that these  activities are an integral part of their emotional life, and that women  perform them only, perhaps, in a kind of dark perception of their own  helplessness. On the one side an unconscious egoism impels them to the  defence of those who find themselves in a _similar_ condition; on the  other side, it is a feminine characteristic to apply anything she is to  judge to herself first, and then to make her choice. That she does this,  rests on the eminent overweight of emotion. So Schopenhauer says: “Women  are very sympathetic, but they are behind man in all matters of justice,  probity, and scrupulous conscientiousness. Injustice is the fundamental  feminine defect.”[278] Schopenhauer should have added, “because they are  too sympathetic, because emotion takes up so much place in their minds  that they have not enough left for justice.” According to Proudhon, “The  conscience of woman is as much weaker than man’s as her intelligence is  smaller. Her morality is of a different sort, her ideas of right and  wrong are different, being always on this or that side of justice, and  never requiring any equivalence between rights and duties which are such  a painful necessity to man.” Spencer says,[279] briefly, that the  feminine mind shows a definite lack with regard to the sense of justice.    These assertions show that women are deficient in justice, but do not  show why. The deficiency is to be explained only in the superabundance  of emotional life. This superabundance clarifies a number of facts of  their daily routine. We have, of course, to make a distinction between  the feeling of a gentlewoman, of a peasant woman, and of the innumerable  grades between the two, but this distinction is not essential. Both  noble and proletarian are equally unjust, but the rich emotion restores  a thousand times what may be missing in justice, and perhaps in many  cases hits better upon what is absolutely right than the bare masculine  sense of justice. We are, of course, frequently mistaken by relying on  the testimony of women, but only when we assume that our rigorously  judicial sentence is the only correct one, and when we do not know how  women judge. Hence, we interpret women’s testimonies with difficulty and  rarely with correctness; we forget that almost every feminine statement  contains in itself much more judgment than the testimony of men; we fail  to examine how much real judgment it contains; and finally, we weigh  this judgment in other scales than those used by the woman. We do best,  therefore, when we take the testimony of man and woman together in order  to find the right average. This is not easy, for we are unable to enter  properly into the emotional life of woman, and can not therefore  discount that tendency of hers to drag the objective truth in some  biased direction. It might be theoretically supposed that a noble,  kindly, feminine feeling would tend to reflect everything as better and  gentler, and would tend to excuse and conceal. If that were so we might  have a definite standard of valuation, and might be able to discount the  feminine bias. But that is so in perhaps no more than half the cases  that come before us. In all others woman has allowed herself to be moved  to displeasure, and appears as the punishing avenger. Hence, she fights  with all her strength on the side that seems to her to be oppressed and  innocently persecuted, irrespective of whether it is the side of the  accused or of his enemy. In consequence, we must first of all, when  judging her statements, determine the direction in which her emotion  impels her, and this can not be done with a mere knowledge of human  nature. Nothing will do except a careful study of the specific feminine  witness at the time she gives her evidence. And this requires the  expenditure of much time, for, to plunge directly into the middle of  things without having any means of comparison or relation, is to make  judgment impossible or very unsafe. If you are to do it at all you must  discuss other things first and even permit yourself the dishonesty of  asking about matters which you already know in order to find some  measure of the degree of feminine obliqueness. Of course, one discovers  here only the degree of obliqueness, not its direction--in the case  selected for comparison the woman might have judged too kindly, in the  case in hand she may just as well be too rigorous. But all things have a  definite limit, and hence, much practice and much goodwill will help us  to discover the direction of obliqueness.    When we inquire into the emotional life of the simple, uneducated women,  we find it to be fundamentally the same as that of women of other  classes, but different in expression, and it is the expression we have  to observe. Its form is often raw, therefore difficult to discover. It  may express itself in cursing and swearing, but it is still an  expression of emotion, just as are the mother’s curses or beatings of  her child because it has fallen and hurt itself. But observe that the  prevalence of emotion is so thoroughly a feminine condition that it is  clearly noticeable only where femininity itself is explicit--therefore,  always weaker among masculine women, and in the single individual most  powerful when femininity is most fully developed. It grows in the child,  remains at a constant level when woman becomes completely woman, and  decreases when, in advanced age, the differences in sex begin to  disappear. Very old men and very old women are also in this matter very  close together.      Section 77. (e) Weakness.    “Frailty, thy name is woman,” says Shakespeare, and Corvin explains this  in teasing fashion: “Women pray every day, ‘Lead us not into temptation,  for see, dear God, if you do so I can’t resist it.’” Even Kant[280]  takes feminine weakness as a distinguishing criterion: “In order to  understand the whole of mankind we need only to turn our attention to  the feminine sex, for where the force is weaker the tool is so much the  more artistic.” Experienced criminalists explain the well-known fact  that women are the chief sources of anonymous letters by their weakness.  From the physical inferiority of woman her mental inferiority may be  deduced, and though we learn a hundred times that small, weak men can be  mentally stronger than great and strong ones, it is, of course, natural,  that as a rule the outcome of a powerful body is also a powerful mind.  The difficulty is to discover in _what_ feminine weakness expresses  itself. The frequently joked-about hen-pecking of men has been explained  by Voltaire as the fulfilment of the divine purpose of taming men  through the medium of the specially created instrument--woman. Victor  Hugo calls men only woman’s toys. “Oh, this lofty providence which gives  each one its toy, the doll to the child, the child to the man, the man  to the woman, the woman to the devil.” The popular proverb also seems to  assign them considerable strength, at least to aged women. For we hear  in all kinds of variations the expression, “An old woman will venture  where the devil does not dare to tread.” Nor must we underestimate the  daily experience of feminine capacity to bear pain. Midwives of  experience unanimously assure us that no man would bear what a woman  regularly has to, every time she gives birth to a child; and surgeons  and dentists assure us similarly. Indeed the great surgeon, Billroth, is  said to have asserted that he attempted new methods of operation on  women first because they are less subject to pain, for like savages they  are beings of a lower status and hence better able to resist than men.  In the light of such expressions we have to doubt the assertion that  women are distinguished by weakness, and yet that assertion is correct.  The weakness must, however, not be sought where we expect to find it,  but in the quite different feminine intelligence. Wherever intelligence  is not taken into consideration, woman is likely to show herself  stronger than man. She is better able to stand misfortune, to nurse  patients, to bear pain, to bring up children, to carry out a plan, to  persevere in a plan. It would be wrong to say that feminine weakness is  a weakness of will, for most examples show that women’s wills are  strong. It is in matters of intelligence that they fail. When somebody  has to be persuaded, we find that a normally-organized man may agree  when he is shown a logically-combined series of reasons. But the  feminine intelligence is incapable of logic; indeed, we should make a  mistake in paying honor to the actual feminine in woman if she were  capable of logic. She is rather to be persuaded with apparent reasons,  with transitory and sparkling matters that have only the semblance of  truth. We find her too ready to agree, and blame her will when it is  only her different form of intelligence. She persuades herself in the  same way. An epithet, a sparkling epigram, a pacifying reflection is  enough for her; she does not need a whole construction of reason, and  thus she proceeds to do things that we again call “weak.” Take so  thoroughly a feminine reflection as this: “The heart seems to beat--why  shouldn’t it beat for somebody?” and the woman throws herself on the  breast of some adventurer. The world that hears of this fact weeps over  feminine “weakness,” while it ought really to weep over defective  intelligence and bad logic. That the physiological throb of the heart  need not become significant of love, that the owner of a beating heart  need not be interested in some man, and certainly not in that particular  adventurer, she does not even consider possible. She is satisfied with  this clean-cut, sparkling syllogism, and her understanding is calm. The  judge in the criminal court must always first consider the weakness of  the feminine intelligence, not of the feminine will.    It is supposed to be weakness of will which makes woman gossipy, unable  to keep a secret. But here again it is her understanding that is at  fault. This is shown by the fact, already thoroughly discussed by Kant,  that women are good keepers of their own secrets, but never of the  secrets of others. If this were not a defect of intelligence they would  have been able to estimate the damage they do. Now, every one of us  criminalists knows that the crime committed, and even the plan for it,  has in most cases been betrayed by women. We can learn most about this  matter from detectives, who always go to women for the discovery of  facts, and rarely without success. Of course, the judge must not act  like a detective, but he must know, when something is already a matter  of discussion and its source is sought, where to look. He is to look for  the woman in the case.    Another consideration of importance is the fact that women who have told  secrets have also altered them. This is due to the fact that because  they are secrets the whole is not told them and they have had to infer  much, or they have not properly understood what was told. Now, if we  perceive that only a part of the revealed secret can be correct, the  situation may be inferred with complete safety, but only by remembering  this curious trait of feminine intelligence. We have only to ask what  illogical elements does the matter contain? When these are discovered we  have to ask, what is their logical form? If the process is followed  properly we get at the truth that what happens happens logically, but  what is thought, is thought illogically even by women.    When we summarise all we know about woman we may say briefly: Woman is  neither better nor worse, neither more nor less valuable than man, but  she is different from him and inasmuch as nature has created every  object correctly for its purpose, woman has also been so created. The  reason of her existence is different from that of man’s and hence, her  nature is different.      Section 78. (b) Children.    The special character of the child has to be kept in mind both when it  appears as witness and as accused. To treat it like an adult is always  wrong. It would be wrong, moreover, to seek the differences in its  immaturity and inexperience, in its small knowledge and narrower  outlook. This is only a part of the difference. The fact is, that  because the child is in the process of growth and development of its  organs, because the relations of these to each other are different and  their functions are different, it is actually a different kind of being  from the adult. When we think how different the body and actions of the  child are, how different its nourishment, how differently foreign  influences affect it, and how different its physical qualities are, we  must see that its mental character is also completely different. Hence,  a difference in degree tells us nothing, we must look for a difference  in kind. Observations made by individuals are not enough. We must  undertake especial studies in the very rich literature.[281]      Section 79. (1) _General Consideration._    One does not need to have much knowledge of children to know that as a  rule, children are more honest and straightforward than adults. They are  good observers, more disinterested and hence unbiased in giving  evidence, but because of their weakness, more subject to the influence  of other people. Apart from intentional influences there is the  tremendous influence of selected preconceptions. If a child is an  important witness we can never get the truth from him until we discover  what his ideals are. It is, of course, true that everybody who has  ideals is influenced by them, but it is also true that children who have  adventurous, imaginative tendencies are so steeped in them that  everything they think or do gets color, tone, and significance from  them. What the object of adventure does is good, what it does not do is  bad, what it possesses is beautiful, and what it asserts is correct.  Numerous unexplainable assertions and actions of children are cleared up  by reference to their particular ideals, if they may be called ideals.    As a rule, we may hold that children have a certain sense of justice,  and that they find it decidedly unpleasant to see anybody treated  otherwise than he deserves. But in this connection it must be considered  that the child has its own views as to what a person’s deserts are, and  that these views can rarely be judged by our own. In the same way it is  certain that, lacking things to think or to trouble about, children are  much interested in and remember well what occurs about them. But, again,  we have to bear in mind that the interest itself develops from the  child’s standpoint and that his memory constructs new events in terms of  his earlier experiences. As a rule, we may presuppose in his memory only  what is found already in his occupations. What is new, altogether new,  must first find a function, and that is difficult. If, now, a child  remembers something, he will first try to fit it to some function of  memory already present and this will then absorb the new fact, well or  ill, as the case may be. The frequent oversight of this fact is the  reason for many a false interpretation of what the child said; he is  believed to have perceived falsely and to have made false restatements,  when he has only perceived and restated in his own way.    As children have rarely a proper sense of the value of life, they  observe an undubitable death closely without much fear. This explains  many an unbelievable act of courage or clear observation in a child in  cases where an adult, frightened, can see nothing. It is, hence, unjust  to doubt many a statement of children, because you doubt their  “courage.” “Courage” was not in question at all.    Concerning the difference between boys and girls, Löbisch[282] says  rightly, that girls remember persons better, and boys, things. He adds,  moreover: “The more silent girl, who is given to observe what is before  her, shows herself more teachable than the spiteful and also more  imaginative boy who understands with difficulty because he is intended  to be better grounded and to go further in the business of knowing. The  girl, all in all, is more curious; the boy, more eager to know. What he  fails in, what he is not spurred to by love or talent, he throws  obstinately aside. While the girl loyally and trustfully absorbs her  teachings, the boy remains unsatisfied without some insight into the  _why_ or _how_, without some proof. The boy enters daily more and more  into the world of concepts, while the girl thinks of objects not as  members of a class, but as definite particular things.”      Section 80. (2) _Children as Witnesses._    Once, in an examination of the value of the testimony of children, I  found it to be excellent in certain directions because not so much  influenced by passion and special interest as that of adults, and  because we may assume that children have classified too little rather  than too much; that they frequently do not understand an event but  perceive instinctively that it means disorder, and hence, become  interested in it. Later the child gets a broader horizon and understands  what he has not formerly understood, although, possibly, not altogether  with correctness.    I have further found that the boy just growing out of childhood, in so  far as he has been well brought up, is especially the best observer and  witness there is. He observes everything that occurs with interest,  synthesizes events without prejudice, and reproduces them accurately,  while the girl of the same age is often an unreliable, even dangerous  witness. This is almost always the case when the girl is in some degree  talented, impulsive, dreamy, romantic, and adventurous,--she expresses a  sort of weltschmerz connected with ennui. This comes early, and if a  girl of that age is herself drawn into the circle of the events in  question, we are never safe from extreme exaggeration. The merest  larceny becomes a small robbery; a bare insult, a remarkable attack; a  foolish quip, an interesting seduction; and a stupid, boyish  conversation, an important conspiracy. Such causes of mistakes are  well-known to all judges; at the same time they are again and again  permitted to recur.    The sole means of safety from them is the clearest comprehension  possible of the mental horizon of the child in question. We have very  little general knowledge about it, and hence, are much indebted to the  contemporary attempts of public-school teachers to supply the  information. We all know that we must make distinctions between city and  country children, and must not be surprised at the country child who has  not seen a gas-lamp, a railroad, or something similar. Stanley Hall  tried to discover from six year old children whether they really knew  the things, the names of which they used freely. It seemed, as a result,  that 14% of them had never seen a star; 45% had never been in the  country; 20% did not know that milk came from a cow; 50% that fire-wood  comes from trees; 13% to 15% the difference between green, blue and  yellow; and 4% had never made the acquaintance of a pig.    Karl Lange made experiments (reported in “Über Apperzeption,” Plauen,  1889) on 500 pupils in 33 schools in small towns. The experiment showed  that 82% had never seen sun-rise; 77% a sunset; 36% a corn field; 49% a  river; 82% a pond; 80% a lock; 37% had never been in the woods, 62%  never on the mountains, and 73% did not know how bread was made from  grain. Involuntarily the question arises, what must be the position of  the unfortunate children of large cities, and moreover, what may we  expect to hear from children who do not know things like that, and at  the same time speak of them easily? Adults are not free from this  difficulty either. We have never yet seen a living whale, or a sandstorm  in the Sahara, or an ancient Teuton, yet we speak of them confidently  and profoundly, and never secure ourselves against the fact that we have  never seen them. Now, as we of the ancient Teuton, so children of the  woods; neither have seen them, but one description has as much or as  little value as the other.    Concerning the integration of senses, Binet and Henri[283] have examined  7200 children, whom they had imitate the length of a model line, or pick  out from a collection of lines those of similar length. The latter  experiment was extraordinarily successful.    The senses of children are especially keen and properly developed. It is  anatomically true that very young children do not hear well; but that is  so at an age which can not be of interest to us. Their sense of smell  is, according to Heusinger, very dull, and develops at the time of  puberty, but later observers, in particular those who, like Hack,  Cloquet and others, have studied the sense of smell, say nothing about  this.    Concerning the accuracy of representation in children authorities are  contradictory. Montaigne says that all children lie and are obstinate.  Bourdin corroborates him. Maudsley says that children often have  illusions which seem to them indubitably real images, and Mittermaier  says that they are superficial and have youthful fancies. Experience in  practice does not confirm this judgment. The much experienced Herder  repeatedly prizes children as born physiognomists, and Soden values the  disinterestedness of children very highly. According to Löbisch,  children tell untruths without lying. They say only what they have in  mind, but they do not know and care very little whether their mental  content is objective and exists outside of them, or whether only half  real and the rest fanciful. This is confirmed by legal experience which  shows us, also, that the subjective half of a child’s story may be  easily identified. It is characteristically different from the real  event and a confusion of the two is impossible.    We must also not forget that there are lacunae in the child’s  comprehension of what it perceives. When it observes an event, it may,  e.g., completely understand the first part, find the second part  altogether new and unintelligible, the third part again comprehensible,  etc. If the child is only half-interested, it will try to fill out these  lacunae by reflection and synthesis, and may conceivably make serious  blunders. The blunders and inaccuracies increase the further back the  event goes into the child’s youth. The real capacity for memory goes far  back. Preyer[284] tells of cases in which children told of events that  they had experienced at thirty-two, twenty-four, and even eighteen  months, and told them correctly. Of course, adults do not recall  experiences of such an early age, for they have long since forgotten  them. But very small children can recall such experiences, though in  most cases their recollection is worthless, their circle of ideas being  so small that the commonest experiences are excluded from adequate  description. But they are worth while considering when a mere fact is in  question, or is to be doubted (Were you beaten? Was anybody there? Where  did the man stand?).    Children’s determinations of time are unreliable. Yesterday and to-day  are easily confused by small children, and a considerably advanced  intelligence is necessary to distinguish between yesterday and a week  ago, or even a week and a month. That we need, in such cases, correct  individualization of the witness is self-evident. The conditions of the  child’s bringing-up, the things he learned to know, are what we must  first of all learn. If the question in hand can fit into the notion the  child possesses, he will answer better and more if quite unendowed, than  if a very clever child who is foreign to the notions of the defined  situation. I should take intelligence only to be of next importance in  such cases, and advise giving up separating clever from stupid children  in favor of separating practical and unpractical children. The latter  makes an essential difference. Both the children of talent and stupid  children may be practical or unpractical. If a child is talented and  practical he will become a useful member of society who will be at home  everywhere and will be able to help himself under any circumstances. If  a child is talented and unpractical, it may grow up into a professor, as  is customarily expected of it. If a child is untalented and practical,  it will properly fill a definite place, and if it has luck and “pull”  may even attain high station in life. If it is untalented and  unpractical it becomes one of those poor creatures who never get  anywhere. For the rôle of witness the child’s practicality is the  important thing. The practical child will see, observe, properly  understand, and reproduce a group of things that the unpractical child  has not even observed. Of course, it is well, also, to have the child  talented, but I repeat: the least clever practical child is worth more  as witness than the most clever unpractical child.    What the term “practical” stands for is difficult to say, but everybody  knows it, and everybody has seen, who has cared about children at all,  that there are practical children.      Section 81. (3) _Juvenile Delinquency._    There have never lacked authors who have assigned to children a great  group of defects. Ever since Lombroso it has been the custom in a  certain circle to find the worst crimes already foreshadowed in  children. If there are congenital criminals it must follow that there  are criminals among children. It is shown that the most cruel and most  unhuman men, like Nero, Caracalla, Caligula, Louis XI, Charles IX, Louis  XIII, etc., showed signs of great cruelty, even in earliest childhood.  Perez cites attacks of anger and rage in children; Moreau, early  development of the sense of vengeance, Lafontaine, their lack of pity.  Nasse also calls attention to the cruelty and savagery of large numbers  of children, traits shown in their liking for horror-stories, in the  topsy-turvy conclusion of the stories they tell themselves, in their  cruelty to animals. Broussais[285] says, “There is hardly a lad who  will not intentionally abuse weaker boys. This is his first impulse. His  victim’s cries of pain restrain him for a moment from further  maltreatment, if the love of bullying is not native with him. But at the  first offered opportunity he again follows his instinctive impulse.”    Even the power of training is reduced and is expressed in the proverb,  that children and nations take note only of their last beating. The time  about, and especially just before, the development of puberty seems to  be an especially bad one, and according to Voisin[286] and  Friedreich,[287] modern man sees in this beginning of masculinity the  cause of the most extraordinary and doubtful impulses. Since Esquirol  invented the doctrine of monomanias there has grown up a whole  literature, especially concerning pyromania among girls who are just  becoming marriageable, and Friedreich even asserts that all pubescent  children suffer from pyromania, while Grohmann holds that scrofulous  children are in the habit of stealing.    When this literature is tested the conclusion is inevitable that there  has been overbold generalization. One may easily see how. Of course  there are badly behaved children, and it is no agreement with the  Italian positivists to add, also, that a large number of criminals were  good for nothing even in their earliest youth. But we are here concerned  with the specific endowment of childhood, and it is certainly an  exaggeration to set this lower than that of maturity. If it be asked,  what influence nurture and training have if children are good without  it, we may answer at once, that these have done enough in having  supplied a counterbalance to the depraving influences of life,--the  awakening passions and the environment.    Children who are bad at an early age are easily noticeable. They make  noise and trouble as thousands of well-behaved children do not, and a  poor few of such bad ones are taken to be representative of all. What is  silent and not significant, goes of itself, makes no impression, even  though it is incomparably of greater magnitude. Individual and noisy  cases require so much attention that their character is assigned to the  whole class. Fortune-telling, dreams, forewarnings, and prophecies are  similarly treated. If they do not succeed, they are forgotten, but if in  one case they succeed, they make a great noise. They appear, therefore,  to seduce the mind into incorrectly interpreting them as typical. And  generally, there is a tendency to make sweeping statements about  children. “If you have understood this, you understand that also,”  children are often told, and most of the time unjustly. The child is  treated like a grown man to whom _this_ has occurred as often as _that_,  and who has intelligence enough and experience enough to apply _this_ to  _that_ by way of identification. Consider an exaggerated example. The  child, let us say, knows very well that stealing is dishonorable,  sinful, criminal. But it does not know that counterfeiting, treachery,  and arson are forbidden. These differences, however, may be reduced to a  hair. It knows that stealing is forbidden, but considers it permissible  to “rag” the neighbors’ fruit. It knows that lying is a sin, but it does  not know that certain lies become suddenly punishable, according to law,  and are called frauds. When, therefore, a boy tells his uncle that  father sent him for money because he does not happen to have any at  home, and when the little rascal spends the money for sweets, he may  perhaps believe that the lie is quite ugly, but that he had done  anything objectively punishable, he may be totally unaware. It is just  as difficult for the child to become subjective. The child is more of an  egoist than the adult; on the one hand, because it is protected and  watched in many directions by the adult; on the other, because, from the  nature of things, it does not have to care for anybody, and would go  ship-wreck if it were not itself cared for. The natural consequences are  that it does not discover the limits between what is permissible, and  what is not permissible. As Kraus says,[288] “Unripe youth shows a  distinct quality in distinguishing good and evil. A child of this age,  that is required to judge the action or relations of persons, will not  keep one waiting for the proper solution, but if the action is brought  into relation to its selfhood, to its own personality, there is a sudden  disingenuity, a twisting of the judgment, an incapacity in the child to  set itself at the objective point of view.” Hence, it is wrong to ask a  child: “Didn’t you know that you should not have done this thing?” The  child will answer, “Yes, I knew,” but it does not dare to add, “I knew  that other people ought not do it, but I might.” It is not necessary  that the spoiled, pampered pet should say this; any child has this  prejudiced attitude. And how shall it know the limit between what is  permitted it, and what is not? Adults must work, the child plays; the  mother must cook, the child comes to the laden table; the mother must  wash, the child wears the clean clothes; it gets the titbits; it is  protected against cold; it is forgiven many a deed and many a word not  permitted the adult. Now all of a sudden it is blamed because it has  gone on making use of its recognized privileges. Whoever remembers this  artificial, but nevertheless necessary, egoism in children will have to  think more kindly of many a childish crime. Moreover, we must not  overlook the fact that the child does many things simply as blind  imitation. More accurate observation of this well known psychological  fact will show how extensive childish imitation is. At a certain limit,  of course, liability is here also present, but if a child is imitating  an imitable person, a parent, a teacher, etc., its responsibility is at  an end.    All in all, we may say that nobody has brought any evidence to show that  children are any worse-behaved than adults. Experience teaches that  hypocrisy, calculating evil, intentional selfishness, and purposeful  lying are incomparably rarer among children than among adults, and that  on the whole, they observe well and willingly. We may take children,  with the exception of pubescent girls, to be good, reliable witnesses.      Section 82. (c) Senility.    It would seem that we lawyers have taken insufficient account of the  characteristics of senility. These characteristics are as definitive as  those of childhood or of sex, and to overlook them may lead to serious  consequences. We shall not consider that degree of old age which is  called second childhood. At that stage the question seriously arises  whether we are not dealing with the idiocy of age, or at least with a  weakness of perception and of memory so obvious that they can not be  mistaken.    The important stage is the one which precedes this, and in which a  definite decline in mental power is not yet perceivable. Just as we see  the first stage of early youth come to an end when the distinction  between boy and girl becomes altogether definite, so we may observe that  the important activity of the process of life has run its course when  this distinction begins to degenerate. It is essentially defined by the  approximation to each other of the external appearance of the two  sexes,--their voices, their inner character, and their attitude. What is  typically masculine or feminine disappears. It is at this point that  extreme old age begins. The number of years, the degree of intelligence,  education, and other differences are of small importance, and the  ensuing particularities may be easily deduced by a consideration of the  nature of extreme old age. The task of life is ended, because the  physical powers have no longer any scope. For the same reason resistance  to enemies has become lessened, courage has decreased, care about  physical welfare increased, everything occurs more slowly and with  greater difficulty, and all because of the newly-arrived weakness which,  from now on, becomes the denotative trait of that whole bit of human  nature. Hence, Lombroso[289] is not wrong in saying that the  characteristic diseases of extreme old age are rarer among women than  among men. This is so because the change in women is not so sudden, nor  so powerful, since they are weak to begin with, while man becomes a weak  graybeard suddenly and out of the fullness of his manly strength. The  change is so great, the difference so significant and painful, that the  consequence must be a series of unpleasant properties,--egoism,  excitability, moroseness, cruelty, etc. It is significant that the very  old man assumes all those unpleasant characteristics we note in  eunuchs--they result from the consciousness of having lost power.    It is from this fact that Kraus (loc. cit.) deduces the crimes of  extreme old age. “The excitable weakness of the old man brings him into  great danger of becoming a criminal. The excitability is opposed to  slowness and one-sidedness in thought; he is easily surprised by  irrelevancies; he is torn from his drowse, and behaves like a somnolent  drunkard.... The very old individual is a fanatic about rest--every  disturbance of his rest troubles him. Hence, all his anger, all his  teasing and quarreling, all his obstinacy and stiffness, have a single  device: ‘Let me alone.’”    This somnolent drunkenness is variously valued. Henry Holland, in one of  his “Fragmentary Papers,” said that age approximates a condition of  dreams in which illusion and reality are easily confused. But this can  be true only of the last stages of extreme old age, when life has become  a very weak, vegetative function, but hardly any crimes are committed by  people in this stage.    It would be simpler to say that the old man’s weakness gives the earlier  tendencies of his youth a definite direction which may lead to crime.  All diseases develop in the direction of the newly developing weakness.  But selfishness or greed are not young. Hence we must assume that an  aging man who has turned miser began by being prudent, but that he did  not deny himself and his friends because he knew that he was able to  restore, later, what they consumed. Now he is old and weak, he knows  that he can no longer do this easily, i.e., that his money and property  are all that he has to depend on in his old age, and hence, he is very  much afraid of losing or decreasing them, so that his prudence becomes  miserliness, later mania for possession, and even worse; finally it may  turn him into a criminal.    The situation is the same sexually. Too weak to satisfy natural  instincts in adults, he attacks immature girls, and his fear of people  he can no longer otherwise oppose turns him into a poisoner. Drobisch  finds that by reason of the alteration of characteristics, definite  elements of the self are distinguishable at every stage. The  distinguishing element in extreme old age, in senility, is the loss of  power, and if we keep this in mind we shall be able to explain every  phenomenon characteristic of this period.    Senile individuals require especial treatment as witnesses. An accurate  study of such people and of the not over-rich literature concerning them  will, however, yield a sufficient basis to go on. What is most important  can be found in any text-book on psychology. The individual cases are  considerably helped by the assumption that the mental organization of  senility is essentially simplified and narrowed to a few types. Its  activities are lessened, its influences and aims are compressed, the  present brings little and is little remembered, so that its collective  character is determined by a resultant, composed of those forces that  have influenced the man’s past life. Accurate observation will reveal  only two types of senility.[290] There is the embittered type, and there  is the character expressed in the phrase, “to understand all is to  forgive all.” Senility rarely succeeds in presenting facts objectively.  Everything it tells is bound up with its judgment, and its judgment is  either negative or positive. The judgment’s nature depends less on the  old man’s emotional character than on his experience in life. If he is  one of the embittered, he will probably so describe a possibly harmful,  but not bad event, as to be able to complain of the wickedness of the  world, which brought it about, that at one time such and such an evil  happened to him. The excusing senile will begin with “Good God, it  wasn’t so bad. The people were young and merry, and so one of them--.”  That the same event is presented in a fundamentally different light by  each is obvious. Fortunately, the senile is easily seen through and his  first words show how he looks at things. He makes difficulties mainly by  introducing memories which always color and modify the evidence. The  familiar fact that very old men remember things long past better than  immediate occurrences, is to be explained by the situation that the  ancient brain retains only that which it has frequently experienced. Old  experiences are recalled in memory hundreds and hundreds of times, and  hence, may take deep root there, while the new could be repeated, only a  few times, and hence had not time to find a place before being  forgotten. If the old man tells of some recent event, some similar  remote event is also alive in his mind. The latter has, however, if not  more vivid at least equally vigorous color, so that the old man’s story  is frequently composed of things long past. I do not know how to  eliminate these old memories from this story. There are always  difficulties, particularly as personal experiences of evil generally  dominate these memories. It is not unjust, that proverb which says “If  youth is at all silly, old age remembers it well.”      Section 83. (d) Differences in Conception.    I should like to add to what precedes, that senility presents fact and  judgment together. In a certain sense every age and person does so and,  as I have repeatedly said, it would be foolish to assert that we have  the right to demand only facts from witnesses. Setting aside the  presence of inferences in most sense-perceptions, every exposition  contains, without exception, the judgment of its subject-matter, though  only, perhaps, in a few dry words. It may lie in some choice expression,  in the tone, in the gesture but it is there, open to careful  observation. Consider any simple event, e.g., two drunkards quarreling  in the street. And suppose we instruct any one of many witnesses to tell  us only the facts. He will do so, but with the introductory words, “It  was a very ordinary event,” “altogether a joke,” “completely harmless,”  “quite disgusting,” “very funny,” “a disgusting piece of the history of  morals,” “too sad,” “unworthy of humanity,” “frightfully dangerous,”  “very interesting,” “a real study for hell,” “just a picture of the  future,” etc. Now, is it possible to think that people who have so  variously characterized the same event will give an identical  description of the mere fact? They have seen the event in accordance  with their attitude toward life. One has seen nothing; another this;  another that; and, although the thing might have lasted only a very  short time, it made such an impression that each has in mind a  completely different picture which he now reproduces.[291] As Volkmar  said, “One nation hears in thunder the clangor of trumpets, the  hoof-beats of divine steeds, the quarrels of the dragons of heaven;  another hears the mooing of the cow, the chirp of the cricket, the  complaint of the ancestors; still another hears the saints turn the  vault of heaven, and the Greenlander, even the quarrel of bewitched  women concerning a dried skin.” And Voltaire says, “If you ask the devil  what beauty is, he will tell you that beauty is a pair of horns, four  hoofs, and a tail.” Yet, when we ask a witness what is beautiful, we  think that we are asking for a brute fact, and expect as reliable an  answer as from a mathematician. We might as well ask for cleanliness  from a person who thinks he has set his house in order by having swept  the dirt from one corner to another.    To compare the varieties of intellectual attitude among men generally,  we must start with sense-perception, which, combined with mental  perception, makes a not insignificant difference in each individual.  Astronomers first discovered the existence of this difference, in that  they showed that various observers of contemporaneous events do not  observe at the same time. This fact is called “the personal equation.”  Whether the difference in rate of sense-perception, or the difference of  intellectual apprehension, or of both together, are here responsible, is  not known, but the proved distinction (even to a second) is so much the  more important, since events which succeed each other very rapidly may  cause individual observers to have quite different images. And we know  as little whether the slower or the quicker observer sees more  correctly, as we little know what people perceive more quickly or more  slowly. Now, inasmuch as we are unable to test individual differences  with special instruments, we must satisfy ourselves with the fact that  there are different varieties of conception, and that these may be of  especial importance in doubtful cases, such as brawls, sudden attacks,  cheating at cards, pocket-picking, etc.    The next degree of difference is in the difference of observation.  Schiel says that the observer is not he who sees the thing, but who sees  of what parts it is made. The talent for such vision is rare. One man  overlooks half because he is inattentive or is looking at the wrong  place; another substitutes his own inferences for objects, while another  tends to observe the quality of objects, and neglects their quantity;  and still another divides what is to be united, and unites what is to be  separated. If we keep in mind what profound differences may result in  this way, we must recognize the source of the conflicting assertions by  witnesses. And we shall have to grant that these differences would  become incomparably greater and more important if the witnesses were not  required to talk of the event immediately, or later on, thus  approximating their different conceptions to some average. Hence we  often discover that when the witnesses really have had no chance to  discuss the matter and have heard no account of it from a third person,  or have not seen the consequences of the deed, their discussions of it  showed distinct and essential differences merely through the lack of an  opportunity or a standard of correction. And we then suppose that a part  of what the witnesses have said is untrue, or assume that they were  inattentive, or blind.    Views are of similar importance.[292] Fiesto exclaims, “It is scandalous  to empty a full purse, it is impertinent to misappropriate a million,  but it is unnamably great to steal a crown. The shame decreases with the  increase of the sin.” Exner holds that the ancients conceived Oedipus  not as we do; they found his misfortune horrible; we find it unpleasant.    These are poetical criminal cases presented to us from different points  of view; and we nowadays understand the same action still more  differently, and not only in poetry, but in the daily life. Try, for  example, to get various individuals to judge the same formation of  clouds. You may hear the clouds called flower-stalks with spiritual  blossoms, impoverished students, stormy sea, camel, monkey, battling  giants, swarm of flies, prophet with a flowing beard, dunderhead, etc.  We have coming to light, in this accidental interpretation of fact, the  speaker’s view of life, his intimacies, etc. This emergence is as  observable in the interpretation also of the ordinary events of the  daily life. There, even if the judgments do not vary very much, they are  still different enough to indicate quite distinct points of view. The  memory of the curious judgment of one cloud-formation has helped me many  a time to explain testimonies that seemed to have no possible  connection.    _Attitude or feeling_--this indefinable factor exercises a great  influence on conception and interpretation. It is much more wonderful  than even the march of events, or of fate itself. Everybody knows what  attitude (stimmung) is. Everybody has suffered from it, everybody has  made some use of it, but nobody can altogether define it. According to  Fischer, attitude consists in the compounded feelings of all the inner  conditions and changes of the organism, expressed in consciousness.  This would make attitude a sort of vital feeling, the resultant of the  now favorable, now unfavorable functioning of our organs. The  description is, however, not unexceptionable, inasmuch as single,  apparently insignificant influences upon our senses may create or alter  our attitudes for a long time without revealing its effect on any organ  or its integration with the other mental states. I know how merely good  or bad weather determines attitude, how it may be helped immediately by  a good cigar, and how often we may pass a day, joyous or dejected, only  to discover that the cause is a good or a bad dream of the foregoing  night. Especially instructive in this regard was a little experience of  mine during an official journey. The trouble which brought me out was an  ordinary brawl between young peasants, one of whom was badly cut up and  was to be examined. Half-way over, we had to wait at a wayside inn where  I expected a relieving gendarme. A quarter of an hour after the stop,  when we renewed the journey, I found myself overcome by unspeakable  sadness, and this very customary brawl seemed to me especially  unpleasant. I sympathized with the wounded boy, his parents, his  opponents, all strangers to me, and I bewrayed the rawness of mankind,  its love for liquor, etc. This attitude was so striking that I began to  seek its cause. I found it, first of all, in the dreary region,--then in  the cup of hot coffee that I had drunk in the restaurant, which might  possibly have been poisonous;--finally, it occurred to me that the  hoof-beats of the horses were tuned to a very saddening minor chord. The  coachman in his hurry had forgotten to take bells with him, and in order  to avoid violating police regulations he had borrowed at the inn another  peal, and my sad state dated from the moment I heard it. I banished the  sound and immediately I found myself enjoying the pretty scenery.    I am convinced that if I had been called to testify in my sad state, I  would have told the story otherwise than normally. The influence of  music upon attitude is very well known. The unknown influence of  external conditions also makes a difference on attitude. “If you are  absorbed in thought,” says Fechner, “you notice neither sunshine nor the  green of the meadows, etc., and still you are in a quite different  emotional condition from that which would possess you in a dark room.”    The attitude we call indifference is of particular import. It appears,  especially, when the ego, because of powerful impressions, is concerned  with itself; pain, sadness, important work, reflection, disease, etc.  In this condition we depreciate or undervalue the significance of  everything that occurs about us. Everything is brought into relation to  our personal, immediate condition, and is from the point of view of our  egoism, more or less indifferent. It does not matter whether this  attitude of indifference occurs at the time of perception or at the time  of restatement during the examination. In either case, the fact is  robbed of its hardness, its significance, and its importance; what was  white or black, is described as gray.    There is another and similar attitude which is distinguished by the fact  that we are never quite aware of it but are much subject to it.  According to Lipps[293] and Lotze,[294] there is to be observed in  neurotic attitudes a not rare and complete indifference to feeling, and  in consciousness an essential lack of feeling-tone in perception. Our  existence, our own being, seems to us, then, to be a foreign thing,  having little concern with us--a story we need not earnestly consider.  That in such condition little attention is paid to what is going on  around us seems clear enough. The experiences are shadowy and  superficial; they are indifferent and are represented as such only. This  condition is very dangerous in the law court, because, where a  conscientious witness will tell us that, e.g., at the time of the  observation or the examination he was sick or troubled, and therefore  was incorrect, a person utterly detached in the way described does not  tell the judge of his condition, probably because he does not know  anything about it.    There are certain closely-related mental and physical situations which  lead to quite a different view. Those who are suffering physically,  those who have deeply wounded feelings, and those who have been reduced  by worry, are examined in the same way as normal people, yet they need  to be measured by quite a different standard. Again, we are sometimes  likely to suppose great passions that have long since passed their  period, to be as influential as they were in their prime. We know that  love and hate disappear in the distance, and that love long dead and a  long-deferred hatred tend to express themselves as a feeling of mildness  and forgiveness which is pretty much the same in spite of its diverse  sources. If the examiner knows that a great passion, whether of hate or  of love, exists, he thinks he is fooled when he finds a full, calm and  objective judgment instead of it. It seems impossible to him, and he  either does not believe the probably accurate witness, or colors his  testimony with that knowledge.    Bodily conditions are still more remarkable in effecting differences in  point of view. Here no sense-illusion is presented since no change  occurs in sense-perception; the changes are such that arise after the  perception, during the process of judgment and interpretation. We might  like an idea when lying down that displeases us when we stand up.  Examination shows that this attitude varies with the difference in the  quantity of blood in the brain in these two positions, and this fact may  explain a whole series of phenomena. First of all, it is related to  plan-making and the execution of plans. Everybody knows how, while lying  in bed, a great many plans occur that seem good. The moment you get up,  new considerations arise, and the half-adopted plan is progressively  abandoned. Now this does not mean anything so long as nothing was  undertaken in the first situation which might be binding for the  resolution then made. For example, when two, lying in bed, have made a  definite plan, each is later ashamed before the other to withdraw from  it. So we often hear from criminals that they were sorry about certain  plans, but since they were once resolved upon, they were carried out.  Numbers of such phenomena, many of them quite unbelievable in  appearance, may be retroduced to similar sources.    A like thing occurs when a witness, e.g., reflects about some event  while he is in bed. When he thinks of it again he is convinced, perhaps,  that the matter really occurred in quite another way than he had newly  supposed it to. Now he may convince himself that the time at which he  made the reflections was nearer the event, and hence, those reflections  must have been the more correct ones--in that case he sticks to his  first story, although that might have been incorrect. Helmholtz[295] has  pointed to something similar: “The colors of a landscape appear to be  much more living and definite when they are looked at obliquely, or when  they are looked at with the head upside down, than when they are looked  at with the head in its ordinary position. With the head upside down we  try correctly to judge objects and know that, e.g., green meadows, at a  certain distance, have a rather altered coloration. We become used to  that fact, discount the change and identify the green of distant objects  with the shade of green belonging to near objects. Besides, we see the  landscape from the new position as a flat image, and incidentally we see  clouds in right perspective and the landscape flat, like clouds when we  see them in the ordinary way.” Of course, everybody knows this. And of  course, in a criminal case such considerations will hardly ever play  any rôle. But, on the other hand, it is also a matter of course that the  reason for these differences might likewise be the reason for a great  many others not yet discovered, and yet of great significance to  criminalists.    Such is the situation with regard to comparison. Schiel laid much  emphasis on the fact that two lines of unequal length seem equal when  they diverge, although their difference is recognized immediately if  they are parallel, close together, and start from the same level. He  says that the situation is similar in all comparison. If things may be  juxtaposed they can be compared; if not, the comparison is bound to be  bad. There is no question of illusion here, merely of convenience of  manipulation. Juxtaposition is frequently important, not for the  practical convenience of comparison, but because we must know whether  the witness has discovered the right juxtaposition. Only if he has, can  his comparison have been good. To discover whether he has, requires  careful examination.    Conception and interpretation are considerably dependent on the interest  which is brought to the object examined. There is a story of a child’s  memory of an old man, which was not a memory of the _whole_ man, but  only of a green sleeve and a wrinkled hand presenting a cake of  chocolate. The child was interested only in the chocolate, and hence,  understood it and its nearest environment--the hand and the sleeve. We  may easily observe similar cases. In some great brawl the witness may  have seen only what was happening to his brother. The numismatist may  have observed only a bracelet with a rare coin in a heap of stolen  valuables. In a long anarchistic speech the witness may have heard only  what threatened his own welfare. And so on. The very thing looks  different if, for whatever reason, it is uninteresting or intensely  interesting. A color is quite different when it is in fashion, a flower  different when we know it to be artificial, the sun is brighter at home,  and home-grown fruit tastes better. But there is still another group of  specific influences on our conceptions and interpretations, the examples  of which have been increasing unbrokenly. One of these is the variety in  the significance of words. Words have become symbols of concepts, and  simple words have come to mean involved mathematical and philosophical  ideas. It is conceivable that two men may connote quite different things  by the word “symbol.” And even in thinking and construing, in making use  of perceived facts, different conceptions may arise through presenting  the fact to another with symbols, that to him, signify different things.  The difference may perhaps not be great, but when it is taken in  connection with the associations and suggestions of the word used, small  mistakes multiply and the result is quite different from what it might  have been if another meaning had been the starting-point. The use of  foreign words, in a sense different from that used by us, may lead us  far astray. It must be borne in mind that the meaning of the foreign  word frequently does not coincide with the sense it has in the  dictionary. Hence, it is dangerous in adducing evidence to use foreign  expressions when it is important to adhere strictly to a single meaning.  Taine says, correctly: “Love and amour, girl and jeune fille, song and  chanson, are not identical although they are substituted for one  another.” It is, moreover, pointed out that children, especially, are  glad to substitute and alter ideas for which one word stands, so that  they expand or contract its meaning haphazard. Bow-wow may first mean a  dog, then a horse, then all animals, and a child who was once shown a  fir tree in the forest said it wasn’t a fir tree, for fir trees come  only at Christmas.    This process is not confined to children. At one time or another we hear  a word. As soon as we hear it we connect it with an idea. This  connection will rarely be correct, largely because we have heard the  word for the first time. Later, we get our idea from events in which  this word occurs, of course, in connection with the object we  instantaneously understand the word to mean. In time we learn another  word, and word and meaning have changed, correctly or incorrectly. A  comparison of these changes in individuals would show how easy both  approximations and diversifications in meaning are. It must follow that  any number of misunderstandings can develop, and many an alteration in  the conception of justice and decency, considered through a long period,  may become very significant in indicating the changes in the meaning of  words. Many a time, if we bear thoroughly in mind the mere changes in  the meaning of the word standing for a doubtful fact, we put ourselves  in possession of the history of morals. Even the most important quarrels  would lapse if the quarreling persons could get emotionally at the  intent of their opponent’s words.    In this connection questions of honor offer a broad field of examples.  It is well known that German is rich in words that show personal  dislikes, and also, that the greater portion of these words are harmless  in themselves. But one man understands this, the other that, when he  hears the words, and finally, German is in the curious position of being  the cause of the largest number of attacks on honor and of cases of  slander in the world. Where the Frenchman laughs and becomes witty, the  German grows sullen, insulting, and looks for trouble. The French call  sensitiveness to insignificant and worthless things, the German way of  quarreling (faire querelle d’allemand). Many a slander case in court is  easily settled by showing people the value of the word. Many who  complained that they were called a creature, a person, etc., went away  satisfied as soon as the whole meaning of the words had been explained  to them.    In conclusion, just a word concerning the influence of time on  conception. Not the length of past time, but the value of the time-span  is what is important in determining an event. According to Herbart,  there is a form of temporal repetition, and time is the form of  repetition. If he is right it is inevitable that time, fast-moving or  slow-moving, must influence the conception of events. It is well-known  that monotony in the run of time makes it seem slow, while time full of  events goes swiftly, but appears long in memory, because a large number  of points have to be thought through. Münsterberg shows that we have to  stop at every separate point, and so time seems, in memory, longer. But  this is not universally valid. Aristotle had already pointed out that a  familiar road appears to be shorter than an unfamiliar one, and this is  contradictory to the first proposition. So, a series of days flies away  if we spend them quietly and calmly in vacation in the country. Their  swiftness is surprising. Then when something of importance occurs in our  life and it is directly succeeded by a calm, eventless period, this  seems very long in memory, although it should have seemed long when it  occurred, and short in the past. These and similar phenomena are quite  unexplained, and all that can be said after numerous experiments is,  that we conceive short times as long, and long times as short. Now, we  may add the remarkable fact that most people have no idea of the  duration of very small times, especially of the minute. Ask any  individual to sit absolutely quiet, without counting or doing anything  else, and to indicate the passing of each minute up to five. He will say  that the five minutes have passed at the end of never more than a minute  and a half. So witnesses in estimating time will make mistakes also, and  these mistakes, and other nonsense, are written into the protocols.    There are two means of correction. Either have the witness determine the  time in terms of some familiar form, i.e., a paternoster, etc., or give  him the watch and let him observe the second hand. In the latter case he  will assert that his ten, or his five, or his twenty minutes were, at  most, no more than a half or a whole minute.    The problem of time is still more difficult when the examination has to  be made with regard to the estimation of still longer periods--weeks,  months, or years. There is no means of making any test. The only thing  that experience definitely shows is, that the certainty of such  estimates depends on their being fixed by distinct events. If anybody  says that event A occurred four or five days before event B, we may  believe him if, e.g., he adds, “For when A occurred we began to cut  corn, and when B occurred we harvested it. And between these two events  there were four or five days.” If he can not adduce similar judgments,  we must never depend upon him, for things may have occurred which have  so influenced his conception of time that he judges altogether falsely.    It often happens in such cases that defective estimates, made in the  course of lengthy explanations, suddenly become points of reference, and  then, if wrong, are the cause of mistakes. Suppose that a witness once  said that an event occurred four years ago. Much later an estimation of  the time is undertaken which shows that the hasty statement sets the  event in 1893. And then all the most important conclusions are merely  argued from that. It is best, as is customary in such cases, to test the  uncertainty and incorrectness of these estimates of time on oneself. It  may be assumed that the witness, in the case in question, is likely to  have made a better estimate, but it may equally be assumed that he has  not done so. In short, the conception of periods of time can not be  dealt with too cautiously.      Section 84. (e) Nature and Nurture.    Schopenhauer was the first to classify people according to nature and  nurture. Just where he first used the categories I do not know, but I  know that he is responsible for them. “Nature” is physical and mental  character and disposition, taken most broadly; “nurture” is bringing up,  environment, studies, scholarship, and experience, also in the broadest  sense of those words. Both together present what a man is, what he is  able to do, what he wants to do. A classification, then, according to  nature and nurture is a classification according to essence and  character. The influence of a man’s nature on his face, we know, or try  to know, but what criminal relationships his nurture may develop for us,  we are altogether ignorant of. There are all sorts of intermediaries,  connections and differences between what the goddess of civilization  finds to prize, and what can be justified only by a return to simplicity  and nature.      Section 85. I. _The Influence of Nurture._    Criminologically the influence of nurture on mankind is important if it  can explain the development of morality, honorableness, and love of  truth. The criminalist has to study relations, actions, and assertions,  to value and to compare them when they are differentiable only in terms  of the nurture of those who are responsible for them. The most  instructive works on this problem are those of Tarde,[296] and  Oelzelt-Newin.[297] Among the older writers Leibnitz had already said,  “If you leave education to me I’ll change Europe in a century.”  Descartes, Locke, Helvetius assign to nurture the highest possible value  while Carlyle, e.g., insists that civilization is a cloak in which wild  human nature may eternally burn with hellish fire. For moderns it is a  half-way house. Ribot says that training has least effect at the two  extremes of humanity--little and transitively on the idiot, much on the  average man, not at all on the genius. I might add that the circle of  idiots and geniuses must be made extremely large, for average people are  very few in number, and the increase in intellectual training has made  no statistical difference on the curve of crime. This is one of the  conclusions arrived at by Adolf Wagner[298] which corroborates the  experience of practising lawyers and we who have had, during the growth  of popular education, the opportunity to make observations from the  criminalistic standpoint, know nothing favorable to its influence. If  the general assertion is true that increased national education has  reduced brawling, damages to property, etc., and has increased  swindling, misappropriations, etc., we have made a great mistake. For  the psychological estimation of a criminal, the crime itself is not  definitive; there is always the question as to the damage this  individual has done his own nature with his deed. If, then, a peasant  lad hits his neighbor with the leg of a chair or destroys fences, or  perhaps a whole village, he may still be the most honorable of youths,  and later grow up into a universally respected man. Many of the best and  most useful village mayors have been guilty in their youth of brawls,  damages to property, resistance to authority, and similar things. But  if a man has once swindled or killed anybody, he has lost his honor,  and, as a rule, remains a scoundrel for the rest of his life. If for  criminals of the first kind we substitute the latter type we get a very  bad outlook.    Individuals yield similar experiences. The most important characteristic  of a somewhat cultivated man who not only is able to read and to write,  but makes some use of his knowledge, is a loudly-expressed discontent  with his existence. If he once has acquired the desire to read, the  little time he has is not sufficient to satisfy it, and when he has more  time he is always compelled to lay aside his volume of poetry to feed  the pigs or to clean the stables. He learns, moreover, of a number of  needs which he can not satisfy but which books have instilled in him,  and finally, he seeks illegal means, as we criminalists know, for their  satisfaction.    In many countries the law of such cases considers extenuating  circumstances and defective bringing-up, but it has never yet occurred  to a single criminalist that people might be likely to commit crime  because they could not read or write. Nevertheless, we are frequently in  touch with an old peasant as witness who gives the impression of  absolute integrity, reliability, and wisdom, so much so that it is gain  for anybody to talk to him. But though the black art of reading and  writing has been foreign to him through the whole of his life, nobody  will have any accusation to make against him about defective  bringing-up.    The exhibition of unattainable goods to the mass of mankind is a  question of conscience. We must, of course, assume that deficiency in  education is not in itself a reason for doubting the witness, or for  holding an individual inclined to crime. The mistakes in bringing-up  like spoiling, rigor, neglect, and their consequences, laziness, deceit,  and larceny, have a sufficiently evil outcome. And how far these are at  fault, and how far the nature of the individual himself, can be  determined only in each concrete case by itself. It will not occur to  anybody to wish for a return to savagery and anarchy because of the low  value we set on the training of the mind. There is still the business of  moral training, and its importance can not be overestimated. Considering  the subject generally, we may say that the aim of education is the  capacity of sympathizing with the feeling, understanding, and willing of  other minds. This might be supplemented, perhaps, also with the  limitation that the sympathy must be correct, profound, and implicative,  for external, approximate, or inverted sympathy will obviously not do.  The servant girl knows concerning her master only his manner of  quarreling and his manner of spitting but is absolutely unaffected by,  and strange to his inner life. The darker aspects of culture and  civilization are most obvious in the external contacts of mankind.    When we begin to count an intelligent sympathy, it must follow that the  sympathy is possible only with regard to commonly conceivable matters;  that we must fundamentally exclude the essential inward construction of  the mind and the field of scientific morality. Hence we have left only  religion, which is the working morality of the populace.    According to Goethe, the great fundamental conflict of history is the  conflict of belief with doubt. A discussion of this conflict is  unnecessary here. It is mentioned only by way of indicating that the  sole training on which the criminalist may rely is that of real  religion. A really religious person is a reliable witness, and when he  is behind the bar he permits at least the assumption that he is  innocent. Of course it is difficult to determine whether he is genuinely  religious or not, but if genuine religion can be established we have a  safe starting point. Various authors have discussed the influence of  education, _pro_ and _con_. Statistically, it is shown that in Russia,  only 10% of the population can read and write, and still of 36,868  condemned persons, no fewer than 26,944 were literate. In the seventies  the percentage of criminals in Scotland was divided as follows, 21%  absolutely illiterate, 52.7 half educated; 26.3% well educated.    The religious statistics are altogether worthless. A part of them have  nothing to do with religion, e.g., the criminality of Jews. One part is  worthless because it deals only with the criminality of baptized  Protestants or Catholics, and the final section, which might be of great  interest, i.e., the criminality of believers and unbelievers, is  indeterminable. Statistics say that in the country _A_ in the year _n_  there were punished x% Protestants, y% Catholics, etc. Of what use is  the statement? Both among the x and the y percentages there were many  absolute unbelievers, and it is indifferent whether they were Protestant  or Catholic unbelievers. It would be interesting to know what percentage  of the Catholics and of the Protestants are really faithful, for if we  rightly assume that a true believer rarely commits a crime, we should be  able to say which religion from the view point of the criminalist should  be encouraged. The one which counts the greater percentage of believers,  of course, but we shall never know which one that is. The numbers of  the “Protestant” criminals, and those of the “Catholics,” can not help  us in the least in this matter.      Section 86. (2) _The Views of the Uneducated._    “To discourse is nature, to assimilate discourse as it is given, is  culture.” With this statement, Goethe has shown where the deficiencies  in culture begin, and observation verifies the fact that the uncultured  person is unable to accept what is told him as it is told him. This does  not mean that uncultured people are unable to remember statements as  they are made, but that they are unable to assimilate any perception in  its integrity and to reproduce it in its natural simplicity. This is the  alpha and the omega of every thing observable in the examination of  simple people. Various thinkers in different fields have noted this  fact. Mill, e.g., observes that the inability to distinguish between  perception and inference is most obvious in the attempt of some ignorant  person to describe a natural phenomenon. Douglas Stewart notices that  the village apothecary will rarely describe the simplest case without  immediately making use of a terminology in which every word is a theory.  The simple and true presentation of the phenomenon will reveal at once  whether the mind is able to give an accurate interpretation of nature.  This suggests why we are frequently engaged in some much-involved  process of description of a fact, in itself simple. It has been  presented to us in this complicated fashion because our informants did  not know how to speak simply. So Kant: “The testimony of common people  may frequently be intended honestly, but it is not often reliable  because the witnesses have not the habit of prolonged attention, and so  they mistake what they think themselves for what they hear from others.  Hence, even though they take oaths, they can hardly be believed.” Hume,  again, says somewhere in the Essay, that most men are naturally inclined  to differentiate their discourse, inasmuch as they see their object from  one side only, do not think of the objections, and conceive its  corroborative principles with such liveliness that they pay no attention  to those which look another way. Now, whoever sees an object from one  side only does not see it as it comes to him, and whoever refuses to  think of objections, has already subjectively colored his objects and no  longer sees them as they are.    In this regard it is interesting to note the tendency of uneducated  people to define things. They are not interested in the immediate  perception, but in its abstract form. The best example of this is the  famous barrack-room definition of honor: Honor is that thing belonging  to the man who has it. The same fault is committed by anybody who fails  to apprehend the _whole_ as it comes, but perceives only what is most  obvious and nearest. Mittermaier has pointed out that the light-minded,  accidental witness sees only the nearest characteristics. Again, he  says, “It is a well-known fact that uneducated people attend only to the  question that was asked them last.”[299] This fact is important. If a  witness is unskilfully asked in one breath whether he murdered A, robbed  B, and stole a pear from C, he will probably answer with calmness, “No,  I have not stolen a pear,” but he pays no attention to the other two  portions of the question. This characteristic is frequently made use of  by the defense. The lawyers ask some important witness for the  prosecution: “Can you say that you have seen how the accused entered the  room, looked around, approached the closet, and then drew the watch  toward himself?” The uneducated witness then says dryly, “No, I can not  say that,” although he has seen everything except the concealment of the  watch. He denies the whole thing solely because he has been able to  attend to the last portion of the question only. It is very easy to look  out for these characteristics, by simply not permitting a number of  questions in one, by having questions put in the simplest and clearest  possible form. Simple questions are thankfully received, and get better  answers than long, or tricky ones.    For the same reason that prevents uneducated people from ever seeing a  thing as it comes to them, their love of justice depends on their  eagerness to avoid becoming themselves subjects of injustice. Hence,  weak people can never be honest, and most uneducated people understand  by duty that which _others_ are to do. Duty is presented as required of  all men, but it is more comfortable to require it of others, so that it  is understood as only so required. It may be due to the fact that  education develops quiet imperturbability, and that this is conducive to  correcter vision and more adequate objectivity in both events and  obligations.    There is another series of processes which are characteristic of the  point of view of the uneducated. There is, e.g., a peculiar recurring  mental process with regard to the careful use of life preservers, fire  extinguishers, and other means of escape, which are to be used _hastily_  in case of need. They are found always carefully chained up, or hidden  in closets by the ignorant. This is possible only if the idea of  protecting oneself against sudden need does not make itself effective as  such, but is forced out of the mind by the desire to protect oneself  against theft.    Why must the uneducated carefully feel everything that is shown them, or  that they otherwise find to be new? Children even smell such things,  while educated people are satisfied with looking at them. The request in  public places, “Do not touch,” has very good reason. I believe that the  level of culture of an individual may be determined without much  mistake, by his inclination to touch or not to touch some new object  presented him. The reason for this desire can hardly be established but  it is certainly the wish of the uneducated to study the object more  fundamentally and hence, to bring into play other senses than that of  sight. It may be that the educated man sees more because he is better  trained in careful observation, so that the uneducated man is really  compelled to do more than merely to look. On the other hand, it may be  that the uneducated man here again fails to perceive the object as it  is, and when it appears to him as object A, or is indicated as that  object, he is inclined to disbelieve, and must convince himself by  careful feeling that it is really an A.[300] It may be, again, that  “trains of association” can help to explain the matter.    That an understanding of the character of an object is dependent on  training and educated observation has been verified many times,  incidentally, also by the fact that the uneducated find it difficult to  get on with representations. Now this can not be accounted for by only  their defective practice. The old, but instructive story of the  peasant-woman who asked her son what he was reading, the black or the  white, repeats itself whenever uneducated people are shown images,  photographs, etc. For a long time I had not noticed that they see the  background as the thing to be attended to. When, for example, you show  an uneducated man a bust photograph, it may happen that he perceives the  upper surroundings of shoulder and head as the lower contours of the  background which is to indicate some fact, and if these contours happen  to be, e.g., those of a dog, the man sees “a white dog.” This is more  frequent than we think, and hence, we must pay little attention to  failures to recognize people in photographs.[301] One more story by way  of example--that of a photographer who snapped a dozen parading young  dragoons, and had gotten the addresses, but not the street numbers of  their parents. He sent for that reason to the twelve parents, for  inspection, a photograph each with the notice that if some mistake had  occurred he would rectify it. But not a parent complained of the  photographer’s failure to have sent them the pictures of their own  children. Each had received a soldier, and appeared to be quite  satisfied with the correctness of his image. Hence it follows again,  that denials of photographic identity by the uneducated are altogether  without value.    In another direction images have a peculiar significance for children  and ignorant people, because they show ineradicable ideas, particularly  with regard to size. Nobody recalls any book so vividly as his first  picture book and its contents. We remember it even though we are  convinced that the people who made our picture book were quite mistaken.  Now, as it frequently happens that the sizes are incorrectly reproduced,  as when, e.g., a horse and a reindeer occur in the same picture, and the  latter seems bigger than the former, the reindeer appears in imagination  always bigger. It does not matter if we learn later how big a reindeer  is, or how many times we have seen one, we still find the animal  “altogether too small, it must be bigger than a horse.” Educated adults  do not make this mistake, but the uneducated do, and many false  statements depend on ideas derived from pictures. If their derivation is  known we may discover the source of the mistake, but if the mistake  occurred unconsciously, then we have to combine the circumstances and  study further to find the reason.    Finally, the general influence of the failure of ignorant people to see  things as they are, upon their feeling-tone is shown in two  characteristic stories. Bulwer tells of a servant whose master beat him  and who was instigated to seek protection in court. He refused  indignantly inasmuch as his master was too noble a person to be subject  to law. And Gutberlet tells the story of the director of police,  Serafini, in Ravenna, who had heard that a notorious murderer had  threatened to shoot him. Serafini had the assassin brought to him, gave  him a loaded pistol and invited him to shoot. The murderer grew pale and  Serafini boxed his ears and kicked him out.      Section 87. (3) _One-Sided Education._    Just a few words about the considerable danger in the testimony  presented by persons of one-sided education. Altogether uneducated  people warn us in their own way, but people who have a certain amount of  training, in at least one direction, impress us to such a degree that we  assume them to be otherwise also educated and thus get involved in  mistakes.    It is hard to say correctly what constitutes an educated man. We demand,  of course, a certain amount of knowledge, but we do not know the  magnitude of that amount of knowledge, and still less its subject  matter. It is remarkable that our time, which has devoted itself more  than all others to natural science, does not include knowledge of such  science in its concept of the educated man. Some ignorance of history,  or of the classics, or even of some modern novels, failure to visit the  theaters and the picture exhibitions, neglect of French and English,  etc., classifies a man at once as lacking essential “culture.” But if he  knows these things, and at the same time exhibits in the most naïve way  an incredible ignorance of zoölogy, botany, physics, chemistry,  astronomy, etc., he still remains “an educated man.” The contradiction  is inexplicable, but it exists, and because of it, nobody can definitely  say what is meant by a one-sided education. The extent of one-sidedness  is, however, illustrated by many examples. We mention only two.  Linnaeus’ own drawings with remarks by Afzelius show that in spite of  his extraordinary knowledge of botany and his wonderful memory, he did  not know a foreign language. He was in Holland for three years, and  failed to understand even the Dutch language, so very similar to his  own. It is told of Sir Humphrey Davy, that during the visit to the  Louvre, in Paris, he admired the extraordinary carving of the frames of  the pictures, and the splendid material of which the most famous of the  Greek sculptures were made.    Now, how are we to meet people of this kind when they are on the witness  stand? They offer no difficulty when they tell us that they know nothing  about the subject in question. Suppose we have to interrogate a  philologist on a subject which requires only that amount of knowledge of  natural science which may be presupposed in any generally educated  individual. If he declares honestly that he has forgotten everything he  had learned about the matter in college, he is easily dealt with in the  same way as “uneducated people.” If, however, he is not honest enough  immediately to confess his ignorance, nothing else will do except to  make him see his position by means of questions, and even then to  proceed carefully. It would be conscienceless to try to spare this man  while another is shown up.    The same attitude must be taken toward autodidacts and dilettantes who  always measure the value of their knowledge by the amount of effort they  had to use in getting it, and hence, always overestimate their  acquirements. It is to be observed that they assert no more than their  information permits them to, and their personality is easily  discoverable by the manner in which they present their knowledge. The  self-taught man is in the end only the parvenu of knowledge, and just as  the parvenu, as such, rarely conceals his character, so the autodidact  rarely conceals his character.    There is an additional quality of which we must beware--that is the  tendency of experts to take pride in some different, incidental, and  less important little thing than their own subject. Frederick the Great  with his miserable flute-playing is an example. Such people may easily  cause mistakes. The knowledge of their attainment in one field causes us  involuntarily to respect their assertions. Now, if their assertions deal  with their hobbies many a silly thing is taken at its face value, and  that value is counterfeit.      Section 88. (4) _Inclination._    Whether a scientific characterization of inclination is possible,  whether the limits of this concept can be determined, and whether it is  the result of nature, culture, or both together, are questions which can  receive no certain answer. We shall not here speak of individual forms  of inclination, i.e., to drink, to gamble, to steal, etc., for these are  comparatively the most difficult of our modern problems. We shall  consider them generally and briefly. Trees and men, says the old  proverb, fall as they are inclined. Now, if we examine the inclination  of the countless fallen ones we meet in our calling we shall have fewer  difficulties in qualifying and judging their crimes. As a rule, it is  difficult to separate inclination, on the one hand, from opportunity,  need, desire, on the other. The capacity for evil is a seduction to its  performance, as Alfieri says somewhere, and this idea clarifies the  status of inclination. The ability may often be the opportune cause of  the development of an evil tendency, and frequent success may lead to  the assumption of the presence of an inclination.    Maudsley points out that feelings that have once been present leave  their unconscious residua which modify the total character and even  reconstruct the moral sense as a resultant of particular experiences.  That an inclination or something similar thereto might develop in this  way is certain, for we may even inherit an inclination,--but only under  certain conditions. This fact is substantiated by the characteristics of  vagabonds. It may, perhaps, be said that the enforcement of the laws of  vagabondage belongs to the most interesting of the psychological  researches of the criminal judge. Even the difference between the real  bona fide tramp, and the poor devil who, in spite of all his effort can  get no work, requires the consideration of a good deal of psychological  fact. There is no need of description in such cases; the difference must  be determined by the study of thousands of details. Just as interesting  are the results of procedure, especially certain statistical results.  The course of long practice will show that among real tramps there is  hardly ever an individual whose calling requires very hard or difficult  work. Peasants, smiths, well-diggers, mountaineers, are rarely tramps.  The largest numbers have trades which demand no real hard work and whose  business is not uniform. Bakers, millers, waiters are hence more  numerous. The first have comparatively even distribution of work and  rest; the latter sometimes have much, sometimes little to do, without  any possible evenness of distribution. Now, we should make a mistake if  we inferred that because the former had hard work, and an equivalent  distribution of work and rest, they do not become tramps, while the  latter, lacking these, do become tramps. In truth, the former have  naturally a need and inclination for hard work and uniform living, have,  therefore, no inclination to tramping, and have for that reason chosen  their difficult calling. The latter, on the other hand, felt an  inclination for lighter, more irregular work, i.e., were already  possessed of an inclination for vagabondage, and had, hence, chosen the  business of baking, grinding, or waiting. The real tramp, therefore, is  not a criminal. Vagabondage is no doubt the kindergarten of criminals,  because there are many criminals among tramps, but the true vagabond is  one only because of his inclination for tramping. He is a degenerate.    Possibly a similar account of other types may be rendered. If it is  attained by means of a statistic developed on fundamental psychological  principles, it would give us ground for a number of important  assumptions. It would help us to make parallel inferences, inasmuch as  it would permit us to determine the fundamental inclination of the  person by considering his calling, his way of approaching his work, his  environment, his choice of a wife, his preferred pleasures, etc. And  then we should be able to connect this inclination with the deed in  question. It is difficult to fix upon the relation between inclination  and character, and the agreement will be only general when a man’s  character is called all those things to which he is naturally, or by  education, inclined. But it is certain that a good or bad character  exists only then when its maxims of desire and action express themselves  in fact. The emphasis must be on the fact; what is factual may be  discovered, and these discoveries may be of use.      Section 89. (5) _Other Differences._    The ancient classification of individuals according to temperaments is  of little use. There were four of them, called humors, and a series of  characteristics was assigned to each, but not one of them had all of its  characteristics at once. Hence temperaments determined according to  these four categories do not really exist, and the categorical  distinction can have no practical value. If, however, we make use of the  significant general meaning of temperament, the apparatus of  circumstance which is connected with this distinction becomes  superfluous. If you call every active person choleric, every truculent  one sanguine, every thoughtful one phlegmatic, and every sad one  melancholy, you simply add a technical expression to a few of the  thousands of adjectives that describe these things. These four forms are  not the only ones there are. Apart from countless medial and  transitional forms, there are still large numbers that do not fit in any  one of these categories. Moreover, temperament alters with age, health,  experience, and other accidents, so that the differentiation is not even  justified by the constancy of the phenomenon. Nevertheless, it is to  some degree significant because any form of it indicates a certain  authority, and because each one of these four categories serves to  connect a series of phenomena and assumes this connection to be  indubitable, although there is absolutely no necessity for it. When  Machiavelli says that the world belongs to the phlegmatic, he certainly  did not have in mind that complex of phenomena which are habitually  understood as the characteristics of the phlegmatic humor. He wanted  simply to say that extremes of conduct lead to as little in the daily  life as in politics; that everything must be reflected upon and  repeatedly tested before its realization is attempted; that only then  can progress, even if slow, be made. If he had said, the world belongs  to the cautious or reflective person, we should not have found his  meaning to be different.    When we seek clearly to understand the nature and culture of an  individual, an investigation into his temperament does not help us in  the least. Let us consider then, some other characteristic on which is  based the judgment of individuals. The proverb says that laughter  betrays a man. If in the theater, you know the subject of laughter, the  manner of laughter, and the point at which laughter first occurred, you  know where the most educated and the least educated people are.  Schopenhauer says that the intelligent man finds everything funny, the  logical man nothing; and according to Erdmann (in Über die Dummheit),  the distressing or laughable characteristics of an object, shows not its  nature, but the nature of the observer. It would seem that the  criminalist might save himself much work by observing the laughter of  his subjects. The embarrassed, foolish snickering of the badly observing  witness; the painful smile of the innocent prisoner, or the convicted  penitent; the cruel laughter of the witness glad of the damage he has  done; the evil laughter of the condemning accomplice; the happy, weak  laughter of the innocent who has adduced evidence of his innocence, and  the countless other forms of laughter, all these vary so much with the  character of the laugher, and are so significant, that hardly anything  compares with them in value. When you remember, moreover, that  concealment during laughter is not easy, at least at the moment when the  laughter ceases, you see how very important laughter may be in  determining a case.    Of equal importance with laughter are certain changes which may occur in  people during a very short time. If we observe in the course of the  daily life, that people, without any apparent reason, so change that we  can hardly recognize them, the change becomes ten times more intense  under the influence of guilt or even of imprisonment. Somebody said that  isolation has revealed the greatest men, the greatest fools, and the  greatest criminals. What, then, might be the influence of compulsory  isolation, i.e., of imprisonment! We fortunately do not live in a time  which permits imprisonment for months and years in even the simplest  cases, but under certain circumstances even a few days’ imprisonment may  completely alter a person. Embitterment or wildness may exhibit itself,  just as sorrow and softness, during the stay under arrest. And hence,  the criminalist who does not frequently see and deal with his subjects  does not perform his duty. I do not mean, of course, that he should see  them for the purpose of getting a confession out of an attack of  morbidity; I mean only, that this is the one way of getting a just and  correct notion of the case. Every criminalist of experience will grant  that he sees the event, particularly the motives of the criminal,  otherwise after the first examination than after the later ones, and  that his later notions are mainly the more correct ones. If we set aside  the unfortunate cases in which the individual held for examination is  instructed by his prison-mates and becomes still more spoiled, I might  permit myself the assertion that imprisonment tends to show the  individual more correctly as he is; that the strange surroundings, the  change from his former position, the opportunity to think over his  situation may, if there are no opposing influences, help the criminalist  a great deal, and this fact is confirmed in the superior results of  later to earlier examinations.    In addition, the bodily condition and the health of the prisoner change  almost always. The new mode of life, the different food and  surroundings, the lack of movement, the moral effect, work directly on  the body, and we must confess, unfortunately, on health. There are,  however, cases in which health has been improved by imprisonment,  especially the health of people who have led a wild, irregular, drunken  life, or such who have had to worry and care too much. But these are  exceptions, and as a rule the prisoner’s physique suffers a great deal,  but fortunately for a short time only. The influence of such effects on  the mind is familiar. The bodily misfortune gives a wide opening for  complete change in moral nature; health sustains the atheist in  darkness. This fact, as mentioned by Bain, may serve to explain the  origin of many a confession which has saved an innocent person at the  last moment.    Nor must we forget that time--and for the prisoner, imprisonment is time  endowed with power--effects many an adjustment of extremes. We know that  utter evil is as rare as perfect virtue. We have nothing to do with the  latter, but we almost as infrequently meet the former. The longer we  deal with “bad men,” the more inclined are we to see the very summit of  devilment as the result of need and friendlessness, weakness,  foolishness, flightiness, and just simple, real, human poorness of  spirit. Now, what we find so redistributed in the course of years, we  often find crushed together and fallen apart in a short time. Today the  prisoner seems to us the most dreadful criminal; in a few days, we have  calmed down, have learned to know the case from another side, the  criminal has shown his real nature more clearly, and our whole notion of  him has changed.    I frequently think of the simple story of Charles XII’s sudden entry  into Dresden. The city fathers immediately called an extraordinary  session for the next day in order to discuss, as the Swedish king  supposed, what they should have done the day before. Every examined  prisoner does the same thing. When he leaves the court he is already  thinking of what he should have said differently, and he repeats his  reflections until the next examination. Hence, his frequently almost  inexplicable variety of statements, and hence, also, the need of  frequent examination.    Finally, there is the fact Mittermaier has pointed to--the importance of  the criminalist’s own culture and character. “If a girl testifies for  her lover and against her brother, the question in judgment arises,  which voice is the more powerful? The judge will not easily be able to  divorce this standard of judgment from himself and his own view of  life.” This is a frequent occurrence. You consider a difficult  psychological case in all its aspects, and suddenly, without knowing how  or why, you have found its solution: “It must have been so and not  otherwise; he has acted so and so for this reason, etc.” A close  examination of such a definite inference will convince you that it is  due to the pathetic fallacy, i.e., you have so inferred because you  would have done so, thought and desired so, under similar circumstances.  The commission of the pathetic fallacy is the judge’s greatest danger.      Section 90. (6) _Intelligence and Stupidity._    The three enemies of the criminalist are evil nature, untruth, and  stupidity or foolishness. The last is not the least difficult. Nobody is  safe from its attacks; it appears as the characteristic of mankind in  general, in their prejudices, their preconceptions, their selfishness,  and their high-riding nature. The criminalist has to fight it in  witnesses, in jurymen, and frequently in the obstinacy,  dunder-headedness, and amusing self-conceit of his superiors. It hinders  him in the heads of his colleagues and of the defendant, and it is his  enemy not least frequently in his own head. The greatest foolishness is  to believe that you are not yourself guilty of foolishness. The  cleverest people do the most idiotic things. He makes the most progress  who keeps in mind the great series of his own stupidities, and tries to  learn from them. One can only console oneself with the belief that  nobody else is better off, and that every stupidity is a basis for  knowledge. The world is such that every foolishness gets somebody to  commit it.    Foolishness is an isolated property. It is not related to intelligence  as cold to warmth. Cold is the absence of heat, but foolishness is not  the absence of intelligence. Both are properties that look in the same  direction. Hence, it is never possible to speak of intelligence or  stupidity by itself. Whoever deals with one deals with the other, but it  would be a mistake to conceive them as a developing series at one end of  which is intelligence, and at the other, stupidity. The transition is  not only frequent, but there are many remarkable cases in which one  passes into the other, gets mixed up with it, and covers it. Hence, a  thing may often be at one and the same time intelligent and stupid,  intelligent in one direction and stupid in another; and it is not  incorrect, therefore, to speak of clever stupidities, and of clever  deeds that are heartily foolish.    The importance of stupidity is due not only to the fact that it may lead  to important consequences, but also to the difficulty of discovering it  in certain cases. It is before all things correct, that foolish people  often seem to be very wise, and that as a rule, much intercourse alone  is able to reveal the complete profundity of a man’s foolishness. But in  our work we can have little intercourse with the people whom we are to  know, and there are, indeed, persons whom we take to be foolish at the  first encounter, and who really are so when we know them better. And  even when we have learned the kind and degree of a man’s foolishness, we  have not learned his way of expressing it, and that discovery requires  much wisdom. Moreover, an incredible amount of effort, persistence, and  slyness is often made use of for the purpose of committing an immense  act of foolishness. Every one of us knows of a number of criminal cases  that remained unexplained for a long time simply because some one  related event could be explained by a stupidity so great as to be  unbelievable. Yet the knowledge that such stupidity actually exists  could explain many a similar matter, simply and easily. This is  especially true with regard to the much discussed “one great stupidity,”  which the criminal commits in almost every crime. Assume that such a  stupidity is impossible, and the explanation of the case is also  impossible. We must never forget that it is exactly the wise who refuse  to think of the possibility of foolishness. Just as everything is clean  to the cleanly, and everything is philosophic to the philosopher,  everything is wise to the wise. Hence, he finds it unintelligible that a  thing may be explained from the point of view of pure unreason. His duty  therefore, is, to learn as much and as accurately as possible about the  nature of foolishness.    There are, perhaps, few books on earth that contain so many clever  things as Erdmann’s little text “Concerning Foolishness” (Über die  Dummheit). Erdmann starts with small experiences. For example, he once  came early to the Hamburg Railway Station and found in the waiting-room  one family with many children, from whose conversation he learned that  they were going to visit a grandfather in Kyritz. The station filled up,  to the increasing fear of the smallest member of the family, a boy. When  the station grew quite full he suddenly broke out: “Look here, what do  all these people want of grandfather in Kyritz.” The child supposed that  because he himself was travelling to Kyritz all other people in the same  place could have had no different intention. This narrowness of the  point of view, the generalization of one’s own petty standpoint into a  rule of conduct for mankind is, according to Erdmann, the essence of  foolishness. How far one may go in this process without appearing  foolish may be seen from another example. When, in the sixties, a  stranger in Paris spoke admiringly of the old trees on a certain avenue,  it was the habit of the Parisians to answer, “Then you also do not agree  with Haussmann?” because everybody knew about the attempt by the  Parisian prefect, Baron Haussmann, to beautify Paris by killing trees.  If, however, the trees in the churchyard of the little village are  praised, and the native peasant replies, “So you know also that our  Smith wants to have the trees chopped down,” the remark is foolish,  because the peasant had no right to assume that the world knows of the  intentions of the village mayor.    Now, if you decrease the number of view-points, and narrow the horizon,  you reach a point where the circumference of ideas is identical with  their center, and this point is the kernel of stupidity, the idiot.  Stupidity is the state of mind in which a man judges everything by  himself. This again may be best illustrated by a figure of speech. If  you go about a room and observe its contents you soon notice how the  objects change place and appearance with the change in your point of  view. If you look _only_ through the key-hole, you do not, however,  recognize that fact; everything seems equal. The idiot is he whose  egoistic eye is the only key-hole through which he looks into the  decorated parlor we call the world. Hence, the defective individual,  l’homme borné, who has real narrowness of mind, possesses only a small  number of ideas and points of view, and hence, his outlook is restricted  and narrow. The narrower his outlook, the more foolish the man.    Foolishness and egoism are privileges of the child; we are all born  foolish and raw. Only light sharpens our wits, but as the process is  very slow, there is not one of us who has not some blunt edges. To  distinguish objects is to be clever; to confound them, to be foolish.  What one first notices in defective minds is the unconditional  universality of their remarks. The generalizations of stupid people are  then unjustly called exaggerations. Where they say “always,” the clever  will say, “two or three times.” The foolish man interrupts his fellow  because he presses to the front as the only justified speaker. What is  most characteristic of him is his attempt to set his ego in the  foreground, “_I_ do this always,” “This is one of my traits,” “_I_ do  this thing in quite another way.” Indeed, every high grade of  foolishness exhibits a certain amount of force which the fool in  question uses to bring his personality forward. If he speaks about  reaching the North Pole, he says, “Of course, I have never been at the  North Pole, but I have been at Annotook,” and when the subject of  conversation is some great invention, he assures us that he has not  invented anything, but that he is able to make brooms, and incidentally,  he finds fault with the invention, and the more foolish he is, the more  fault he finds.    These characteristics must, of course, be kept apart, and foolishness  must not be confused with related qualities, although its extent or  boundaries must not be fixed too absolutely. Kraus, e.g., distinguishes  between the idiot, the fool, the weak-minded, the idea-less, etc., and  assigns to each distinguishing character-marks. But as the notions for  which these expressions stand vary very much, this classification is  hardly justified. A fool in one country is different from a fool in  another, an idiot in the South from an idiot in the North, and even when  various individuals have to be classified at the same place and at the  same time, each appears to be somewhat unique. If, for example, we take  Kraus’s definitions of the idiot as one who is least concerned with  causal relations, who understands them least, and who can not even grasp  the concept of causation, we may say the same thing about the  weak-minded, the untalented, etc. Kant says, rightly, that inasmuch as  fools are commonly puffed-up and deserve to be degraded, the word  foolishness must be applied to a “swell-headed” simpleton, and not to a  good and honest simpleton. But Kant is not here distinguishing between  foolishness and simplicity, but between pretentiousness and kindly  honesty, thus indicating the former as the necessary attribute of  foolishness. Another mode of distinction is to observe that  forgetfulness is a quality of the simpleton who is defective in  attention, but not of the fool who has only a narrow outlook. Whether or  not this is true, is hard to say. There is still another differentiation  in which foolishness and simplicity are distinguished by the lack of  extent, or the intensity of attention.    It is just as difficult to determine what we mean by naïveté, and how to  distinguish that from foolishness. That the concepts nowhere coincide is  indubitable. The contact appears only where one is uncertain whether a  thing is foolish or naïve. The real fool is never naïve, for foolishness  has a certain laziness of thought which is never a characteristic of  naïveté. The great difficulty of getting at the difference is most  evident in the cases of real and artificial naïveté. Many people make  use of the latter with great success. To do so requires the appearance  of sufficient foolishness to make the real simpleton believe that he is  the cleverer of the pair. If the simpleton believes, the mummer has won  the game, but he has not simulated real foolishness; he has simulated  naïveté. Kant defines naïveté as conduct which pays no attention to the  possible judgment of other people. This is not the modern notion of  naïveté, for nowadays we call naïveté an uncritical attitude toward  one’s environment, and its importance in our profession is, perhaps, due  to the fact that--pardon me--many of us practise it. Naturalness,  openness of heart, lovable simplicity, openness of mind, and whatever  else the efflorescence of naïveté may be called, are fascinating  qualities in children and girls, but they do not become the criminal  judge. It is naïve honestly to accept the most obvious denials of  defendant and witness; it is naïve not to know how the examinees  correspond with each other; it is naïve to permit a criminal to talk  thieves’ patter with another in your own hearing; it is still more naïve  to speak cordially with a criminal in this patter; it is naïve not to  know the simplest expressions of this patter; and it is most naïve to  believe that the criminal can discover his duty by means of the  statutes, their exposition, and explanation; it is naïve to attempt to  impose on a criminal by a bald exhibition of slyness; and it is most  naïve of all not to recognize the naïveté of the criminal. A criminalist  who studies himself will recognize how frequently he was naïve through  ignorance of the importance of apparently insignificant circumstances.  “The greatest wisdom,” says La Rochefoucauld, “consists in knowing the  values of things.” But it would be a mistake to attempt always to bring  out directly that alone which appears to be hidden behind the naïve  moment. The will does not think, but it must turn the attention of the  mind to knowledge. It can not will any particular result of knowledge.  It can only will that the mind shall investigate without prejudice.    The proper use of this good will will consist in trying to find out the  quantity of intelligence and stupidity which may be taken for granted in  the interlocutor. I have once shown that it is a great mistake to  suppose the criminal more foolish than oneself, but that one is not  compelled to suppose him to be more intelligent than oneself. Until one  can gain more definite knowledge of his nature, it is best to believe  him to be just as intelligent as oneself. This will involve a mistake,  but rarely a damaging one. Otherwise, one may hit on the correct  solution by accident in some cases, and make great mistakes in all  others.    Intelligence in the sense of wisdom is the important quality in our  interlocutor. The witness helps us with it, and the defendant deceives  and eludes us by its means. According to Kant, a man is wise when he has  the power of practical judgment. According to Dörner, certain  individuals have especial intuitive talents, others have capacity for  empirical investigations, and still others for speculative synthesis. In  the former, their capacity serves to render the object clearly, to  observe it sharply, to analyze it into its elements. In the latter,  there is the capacity for the synthesis, for the discovery of  far-reaching relationships. Again, we hear that the wise head invents,  the acute mind discovers, the deep mind seeks out. The first combines,  the second analyzes, the third founds. Wit blends, sharpness clarifies,  deepness illuminates. Wit persuades, sharpness instructs, deepness  convinces.    In individual cases, a man is completely and suddenly understood,  perhaps, in terms of the following proverb: “There are two kinds of  silence, the silence of the fool and the silence of the wise man--both  are clever.” Kant says, somewhere, that the witty person is free and  pert, the judicious person reflective, and unwilling to draw  conclusions. In a certain direction we may be helped, also, by  particular evidences. So, when, e.g., Hering[302] says, “One-sidedness  is the mother of virtuosity. The work of the spider is wonderful, but  the spider can do nothing else. Man makes a bow and arrow when he can  get no prey in his net, the spider goes hungry.” This distinguishes  mechanical cleverness from conscious wisdom completely. Of the same  illuminating, character are such salse dicta as: “The fool never does  what he says, the wise man never says what he does.” “You can fool one  man, but you can not fool all men.” “Stupidity is natural, wisdom is a  product of art.” “To depend on accident is foolishness, to use accident  is wisdom.” “There are stupidities which can be committed only by the  wise.” “Wisdom is as different from foolishness, as man from monkey.”  “Fools speak what wise men think.” “Understanding is deficient, but  stupidity never is.” etc. These and countless other help us considerably  in individual cases, but give us no general characterization of the  function of wisdom. We may, therefore, get some sort of pragmatic  insight into the wisdom or unwisdom, of an action in the assertion: “To  be wise is to be able to sacrifice an immediate petty advantage to a  later and greater advantage.” This proposition seems not to have  sufficient scope, but on closer examination seems to fit all cases. The  wise man lives according to law, and sacrifices the petty advantage of  immediate sensual pleasure for the greater advantage of sustained  health. He is prudent and sacrifices the immediate petty delights to the  advantage of a carefree age. He is cautious in his speculation, and  sacrifices momentary doubtful, and hence, petty successes, to the  greater later success of certain earning. He is silent, and sacrifices  the petty advantage of appearing for the moment well-informed about all  possible matters, to the greater advantage of not getting into trouble  on account of this. He commits no punishable deeds, and sacrifices  advantages that might be gained for the moment to the later greater  advantage of not being punished. So the analysis might be continued, and  in each case we should find that there was no wisdom which could not be  explained in this way.    The use of our explanatory proposition is possible in all cases which  require determining the real or apparent participation of some  individual in a crime. If the degree of wisdom a man may be credited  with can be determined by means of this analysis, it is not difficult  afterwards to test by its use the probability of his having a share in  the crime in question.    Finally, cases are again and again observed in which very foolish  people--idiots and lunatics--either because of anxiety, terror, wounds  in the head, or shortly before death, become intelligent for a brief  period. It is conceivable that the improvement of mental activity in  these cases arises when the defect has depended on the pathological  dominance of an inhibitory center, the abnormally intensified activity  of which has as its result an inhibition of other important centers  (acute, curable dementia, paranoia). A light, transitory, actual  increase of mental activity, might, possibly, be explained by the  familiar fact that cerebral anemia, in its early stages, is exciting  rather than dulling. Theoretically this might be connected, perhaps,  with the molecular cell-changes which are involved in the disintegration  of the brain. The difference between the effects of these two causes  will hardly be great, but testimony dependent on this altered character  of mental activity will have little reliability. Hallucinations, false  memories, melancholic accusations of self, particularly, may also be  explained in terms of such excitement. We criminalists have frequently  to deal with people in above-named conditions, and when we receive  intelligent answers from them we must never set them aside, but must  carefully make note of them and estimate them in the light of expert  advice.    To this class belongs the interesting phenomenon that we very frequently  meet fools who never do anything foolish. It is not true that these are  simply misjudged and only appear to be foolish. They are really foolish  but they are helped by certain conditions in every instance of their  conduct. To begin with, they are not so foolish as to deceive  themselves; they are, therefore, in possession of a certain notion of  their own weakness, and do not attempt things which are too much for  them. Then, they must have a certain degree of luck in their  undertakings. The proverb says that conceit is the force behind the  fool, and if these fools apply their conceit to appropriate situations,  they succeed. Then again, they sometimes fail to see dangers, and are  therefore free from swindles which are dangerous, even to the cleverest  persons. “The fool stumbles across the abyss into which the wise man  regularly tumbles,” says the proverb again. And if routine may properly  be called the surrogate of talent, we must suppose that custom and  practice may carry the biggest fool so far as to help him in many cases  to success.    According to Esser, the fool thinks in terms of the following  proposition: “Things that are alike in a few points are identical, and  things that are unlike in a few points are altogether diverse.” If this  is true, the fool can fail only when he is drawing inferences of this  kind; if, however, none of the important events in his life involve such  inferences, he has no opportunity to exhibit his essential foolishness.  The same thing is true of his interests. No fool has a real eagerness  for knowledge. He has, instead, curiosity, and this can never be  distinguished with certainty from knowledge. Now, if the fool is lucky,  he seems to be moving forward, shows himself possessed of interests, and  nobody proves that this possession is only idiotic curiosity. The fool  must protect himself against one thing--action. Foolishness in action is  rawness--true rawness is always foolish and can not be mistaken.    Here, again, we draw the extraordinary conclusion that we criminalists,  as in all other cases, must not take man to be what he seems most of the  time, but what he shows himself as, in exceptional cases. The worst man  may have done something absolutely good, the greatest liar may today  tell the truth, and the simpleton may today act wisely. We are not  concerned with man as such; what is important for us is his immediate  self-expression. The rest of his nature is a matter of judgment.      Topic 2. ISOLATED INFLUENCES.    Section 91. (a) Habit.    Habit may be of considerable importance in criminal law. We have, first  of all, to know how far we ourselves are influenced in our thinking and  acting by habit; then it is important, in judging the testimony of  witnesses, to know whether and how far the witness behaved according to  his habits. For by means of this knowledge we may be able to see the  likelihood of many a thing that might have otherwise seemed improbable.  Finally, we may be able properly to estimate many an excuse offered by a  defendant through considering his habits, especially when we are dealing  with events that are supposed to have occurred under stupefaction,  absolute intoxication, distraction, etc.[303] Hume, indeed, has assigned  to habit the maximum of significance; his whole system depends upon the  use of habit as a principle of explanation. He shows that the essence of  all our inferences with regard to facts relates to the principle of  causation, and the foundation of all our beliefs in causation is  experience, while the foundation of inference from experience is habit.  As a matter of fact, it is strange how often an obscure event becomes  suddenly clear by an inquiry into the possibility of habit as its cause.  Even everything we call fashion, custom, presumption, is at bottom  nothing more than habit, or explicable by habit. All new fashions in  clothes, in usages, etc., are disliked until one becomes habituated to  them, and custom and morality must attach themselves to the iron law of  habit. What would my grandmother have said of a woman whom she might  have seen happily bicycling through the streets! How every German  citizen crosses himself when he sees French sea-bathing! And if we had  no idea of a ball among the four hundred what should we say if we heard  that in the evening men meet half-naked women, embrace them vigorously,  pull them round, and bob and stamp through the hall with disgusting  noise until they must stop, pouring perspiration, gasping for breath?  But because we are accustomed to it, we are satisfied with it. To see  what influence habit has on our views of this subject, just close your  ears tightly at some ball and watch the dancers. As soon as you stop  hearing the music you think you are in a lunatic asylum. Indeed, you do  not need to select such a really foolish case. Helmholtz suggests  looking at a man walking in the distance, through the large end of a  telescope. What extraordinary humping and rocking of the body the  passer-by exhibits! There are any number of such examples, and if we  inquire concerning the permissibility of certain events we simply carry  the question of habit into the field of conduct. Hunting harmless  animals, vivisection, the execution of back-breaking tricks, ballets,  and numerous other things, will seem to us shocking, inconceivable,  disgusting, if we are not habituated to them. What here requires thought  is the fact that we criminalists often judge situations we do not know.  When the peasant, the unskilled laborer, or the craftsman, does  anything, we know only superficially the deed’s nature and real status.  We have, as a rule, no knowledge of the perpetrator’s habits, and when  we regard some one of his actions as most reprehensible,--quarrel or  insult or maltreatment of his wife or children--he responds to us with a  most astounded expression. He is not habituated to anything else, and we  do not teach him a better way by punishing him.    Questions of this sort, however, deal with the generality of human  nature, and do not directly concern us. But directly we are required to  make a correct judgment of testimony concerning habit, they will help us  to more just interpretations and will reduce the number of crass  contradictions. This is so because many an assertion will seem probable  when the witness shows that the thing described was habitual. No  definite boundary can be drawn between skill and habit, and we may,  perhaps, say rightly, that skill is possible only where habit exists,  and habit is present where a certain amount of skill has been attained.  Skill, generally, is the capacity of speedy habituation. But a  distinction must be drawn. Habit makes actions easy. Habituation makes  them necessary. This is most obvious in cases of bodily skill,--riding,  swimming, skating, cycling,--everything in which habit and skill can not  be separated, and with regard to which we can not see why we and other  untrained people can not immediately do the same thing. And when we can  do it, we do it without thinking, as if half asleep. Such action is not  skilled, but habitual, i.e., a part of it is determined by the body  itself without the especial guidance of the mind.    We find the hunter’s power to see so many animals, tracks, etc.,  inconceivable. When, e.g., we have once properly mastered the principle  of a quite complicated crystal, we cannot understand why we had not done  so before. We feel in the same way with regard to an unclear drawing, a  new road, some bodily activity, etc. Anybody who has not acquired the  habit might have to take all day to learn the business of dressing and  undressing himself. And how difficult it is just to walk, a thing we do  unconsciously, is confirmed by the mechanic who wants to construct a  walking figure.    That all people are equally subject to habit, is not asserted. The thing  is a matter of disposition, in the sense of the recurrence of past ideas  or tendencies. We must assume that an inclination evinced by idea A  makes possible ideas a´, a´´, a´´´. Habits may develop according to  these dispositions, but the knowledge of the conditions of this  development we do not yet possess. Nevertheless, we tend to assume that  the famous historian X and the famous Countess Y will not get the habit  of drinking or opium-smoking--but in this case our assumption is deduced  from their circumstances, and not from their personality. Hence, it is  difficult to say with certainty that a person is incapable of acquiring  this or that habit. So that it is of importance, when the question  arises, to discover the existence of implied habits whenever these are  asserted in the face of apparently contradictory conditions. There is a  certain presumption for the correctness of the implication, when, e.g.,  the practised physician asserts that he counted the pulse for a minute  without a watch, or when the merchant accurately estimates the weight of  goods within a few grams, etc. But it will be just as well to test the  assertion, since, without this test, the possibility of error is still  great.    Somebody asserts, e.g., that he had been distracted and had paid no  attention to what two persons close to him had said. Suddenly he began  to take notice and found himself able to recapitulate all their remarks.  Or again, a musician, who is almost altogether deaf, says that he is so  accustomed to music that in spite of his deafness he is able to hear the  smallest discord in the orchestra. Yet again, we hear of insignificant,  hardly controllable habits that become accidentally significant in a  criminal case. Thus the crime of arson was observed by the firebrand’s  neighbor, who could have seen the action through the window, only if he  had leaned far out of it. When he was asked what he wanted to see in  the cold winter night, he replied, that he had the habit daily of  spitting out of the window just before going to bed. Another, who was  surprised in his sleep by an entering thief, had heavily wounded the  latter with a great brush, “because he happened to have had it in his  hand.” The happening was due to his habit of being unable to fall asleep  without a brush in his hand. If such habits are demonstrable facts they  serve to explain otherwise unexplainable events.    They are, however, the more difficult to establish, because they occur  mainly in isolated people--old bachelors and old maids--so that their  confirmation by others is rare. On the other hand, every one of us knows  habits of his own or of his friends which would not be believed when  cited, and which would be very difficult to prove when the need arose.  The influence of habit on indifferent matters can be shown by numerous  examples. There is Kant’s citation, that if anybody happened to send his  doctor nine ducats the latter would have to believe that the messenger  had stolen the tenth. If you give a bride most beautiful linen, but only  eleven pieces, she will weep. Give her thirteen pieces, and she will  certainly throw one of them away. If you keep these deep-rooted habits  in mind, you may possibly say that they must have had a definite,  determinative, and alternative influence on body and mind. For example,  from time immemorial mankind has taken medications at definite  intervals, e.g., every hour, every two hours, etc.; hence, a powder  ordered every seventy-seven minutes will cause us complete surprise. But  by what authority does the body require exactly these quantities of time  or weight? Or again, our lectures, private or public, so and so much  time? Of course it would be inconvenient if professors lectured only 52  minutes, yet how much difficulty must not the mind have met in becoming  habituated to exactly 60 minutes of instruction! This habituation has  been going on for a long time, and now children, like nations, regard  the new in the light of the old, so that the old, especially when it is  fixed by language, becomes the mind’s instrument for the control of the  new. Indeed, we often stick linguistically to old things, although they  have been long superannuated.    There is the characteristic state of mind which might be called the  refraction of an idea by the presence of another idea. An example is the  habit of saying, “Unprepared, as I have--” before beginning a speech.  The speaker means to say that he has not prepared himself, but, as he  really has prepared himself, both expressions come out together. This  habitual concurrence of the real thought is of importance, and offers,  frequently, the opportunity of correcting what is said by what is  thought. This process is similar to that in which a gesture contradicts  a statement. We often hear: “I had to take it because it was right  there.” This assertion indicates theft through need, and at the same  time, theft through opportunity. Or again, we hear: “We had not agreed,  before”--this assertion denies agreement and can indicate merely,  because of the added “before,” that the agreement was not of already  _long_ standing. Still again, we hear, “When we fell to the floor, I  defended myself, and struck down at him.” Here what is asserted is  self-defense, and what is admitted is that the enemy was underneath the  speaker. Such refractions of thought occur frequently and are very  important, particularly in witnesses who exaggerate or do not tell the  whole truth. They are, however, rarely noticed because they require  accurate observation of each word and that requires time, and our time  has no time.      Section 92. (b) Heredity.[304]    However important the question of heredity may be to lawyers  psychologically, its application to legal needs is impossible. It would  require, on the one hand, the study of all the literature concerning it,  together with the particular teachings of Darwin and his disciples, and  of Lombroso and his. The criminal-psychological study of it has not yet  been established. The unfounded, adventurous, and arbitrary assertions  of the Lombrosists have been contradicted, especially through the  efforts of German investigators. But others, like Debierre in Lille,  Sernoff in Moscow, Taine, Drill, Marchand have also had occasion to  controvert the Italian positivists. At the same time, the problem of  heredity is not dead, and will not die. This is being shown particularly  in the retort of Marchand concerning the examinations he made with M. E.  Koslow, in the asylum for juvenile offenders founded by the St.  Petersburg Anthropological Society. Between Buckle, who absolutely  denies heredity, and the latest of the modern doctrines, there are a  number of intermediate views, one of which may possibly be true. There  is an enormous literature which every criminalist should study.[305]    Nevertheless, this literature can tell us nothing about the legitimacy  of the premise of heredity. Every educated man still believes Darwin’s  doctrines, and the new theories that seek to emancipate themselves from  it do so only by pushing them out of the big front door, and insinuating  them through the little back door. But according to Bois-Reymond  Darwinism is only the principle of the hereditary maintenance of the  child’s variation from its parents. Everybody knows of real inherited  characters, and many examples of it are cited. According to Ribot,  suicide is hereditary; according to Despine, kleptomania; according to  Lucas, vigorous sexuality; according to Darwin, hand-writing, etc. Our  personal acquaintances show the inheritance of features, figure, habits,  intellectual properties, particularly cleverness, such as, sense of  space and time, capacity for orientation, interests, diseases, etc. Even  ideas have their ancestors like men, and we learn from the study of  animals how instincts, capacities, even acquired ones, are progressively  inherited. And yet we refuse to believe in the congenital criminal! But  the contradiction is only apparent.    A study of the works of Darwin, Weismann, DeVries, etc., shows us  indubitably that no authority asserts the inheritance of great  alterations appearing for the first time in an individual. And as to the  inheritance of acquired characteristics, some authorities assert this to  be impossible.    Until Darwin the old law of species demanded that definite traits of a  species should not change through however long a period. The Darwinian  principle indicates the inheritance of minute variations, intensified by  sexual selection, and, in the course of time, developed into great  variations. Now nobody will deny that the real criminal is different  from the majority of other people. That this difference is great and  essential, is inferred from the circumstance that a habit, a single  characteristic, an unhappy inclination, etc., does not constitute a  criminal. If a man is a thief it will not be asserted that he is  otherwise like decent people, varying only in the accidental inclination  to theft. We know that, besides the inclination to theft, we may assign  him a dislike for honest work, lack of moral power, indifference to the  laws of honor when caught, the lack of real religion,--in short, the  inclination to theft must be combined with a large number of very  characteristic qualities in order to make a thief of a man. There must,  in a word, be a complete and profound change in his whole nature. Such  great changes in the individual are never directly inherited; only  particular properties can be inherited, but these do not constitute a  criminal. Hence, the son of a criminal need not in his turn be a  criminal.    This does not imply that in the course of generations characters might  not compound themselves until a criminal type is developed, but this is  as rare as the development of new species among the animals. Races are  frequently selected; species develop rarely.      Section 93. (c) Prepossession.    Prepossession, prejudice, and anticipatory opinion are, perhaps, the  most dangerous foes of the criminalist. It is believed that the danger  from them is not great, since, in most cases, prepossession controls  only one individual, and a criminal case is dealt with by several, but  this proves nothing. When the elegant teacher of horseback riding has  performed his subtlest tricks, he gracefully removes his hat and bows to  the public, and only at that moment does the public observe that it has  been seeing something remarkable and applauds heartily, not because it  has understood the difficulty of the performance, but because the rider  has bowed. This happens to us however good our will. One man has a case  in hand; he develops it, and if, at the proper time, he says “Voilà,”  the others say, “Oh, yes,” and “Amen.” He may have been led by a  prepossession, but its presence is now no longer to be perceived. Thus,  though our assumptions may be most excellently meant, we still must  grant that a conviction on false grounds, even when unconsciously  arrived at, so suffuses a mind that the event in itself can no longer be  honestly observed. To have no prejudices indicates a healthy, vigorous  mind in no sense. That is indicated by the power to set aside prejudices  as soon as their invalidity is demonstrated. Now this demonstration is  difficult, for when a thing is recognized as a prejudice, it is one no  longer. I have elsewhere,[306] under the heading “anticipatory opinion,”  indicated the danger to which the examining justice is subject thereby,  and have sought to show how even a false idea of location may lead to a  prepossession in favor of a certain view; how vigorous the influence of  the first witness is, inasmuch as we easily permit ourselves to be taken  in by the earliest information, and later on lack time to convince  ourselves that the matter may not be as our earliest advice paints it.  Hence, false information necessarily conceals a danger, and it always is  a matter of effort to see that the crime is a fictitious one, or that  something which has been called accident may conceal a crime. The  average man knows this well, and after a brawl, after contradictory  testimony, etc., both parties hurry to be beforehand in laying the  information. Whoever lays the information first has the advantage. His  story effects a prepossession in favor of his view, and it requires  effort to accustom oneself to the opposite view. And later it is  difficult to reverse the rôles of witness and defendant.    But we have to deal with prepossession in others besides ourself, in  witnesses, accused, experts, jury, colleagues, subordinates, etc. The  more we know, the newer new things seem. Where, however, the  apperceptive mass is hard and compact, the inner reconstruction ceases,  and therewith the capacity for new experiences, and hence, we get those  judges who can learn nothing and forget nothing. Indefiniteness in the  apperceptive masses results in the even movement of apperception. Minds  with confused ideational complexes hit little upon the particular  characteristic of presented fact, and find everywhere only what they  have in mind.    The one-sidedness of apperception frequently contains an error in  conception. In most cases, the effective influence is egoism, which  inclines men to presuppose their own experiences, views, and principles  in others, and to build according to them a system of prepossessions and  prejudices to apply to the new case. Especially dangerous are the  _similar_ experiences, for these tend to lead to the firm conviction  that the present case can in no sense be different from former ones. If  anybody has been at work on such earlier, similar cases, he tends to  behave now as then. His behavior at that time sets the standard for the  present, and whatever differs from it he calls false, even though the  similarity between the two cases is only external and apparent.    It is characteristic of egoism that it causes people to permit  themselves to be bribed by being met half-way. The inclination and favor  of most men is won by nothing so easily and completely as by real or  apparent devotion and interest. If this is done at all cleverly, few can  resist it, and the prepossession in their favor is complete. How many  are free of prejudice against ugly, deformed, red-haired, stuttering,  individuals, and who has no prejudice in favor of handsome, lovable  people? Even the most just must make an effort so to meet his neighbor  as to be without prejudice for or against him, because of his natural  endowment.    Behavior and little pleasantnesses are almost as important. Suppose that  a criminalist has worked hard all morning. It is long past the time at  which he had, for one reason or another, hoped to get home, and just as  he is putting his hat on his head, along comes a man who wants to lay  information concerning some ancient apparent perjury. The man had let it  go for years, here he is with it again at just this inconvenient moment.  He has come a long distance--he can not be sent away. His case,  moreover, seems improbable and the man expresses himself with  difficulty. Finally, when the protocol is made, it appears that he has  not been properly understood, and moreover, that he has added many  irrelevant things--in short, he strains one’s patience to the limit.  Now, I should like to know the criminalist who would not acquire a  vigorous prejudice against this complainant? It would be so natural that  nobody would blame one for such a prejudice. At the same time it is  proper to require that it shall be only transitive, and that later, when  the feeling has calmed, everything shall be handled with scrupulous  conscientiousness so as to repair whatever in the first instance might  have been harmed.    It is neither necessary nor possible to discuss all the particular forms  of prepossession. There is the unconditional necessity of merely making  a thoroughly careful search for their presence if any indication  whatever, even the remotest, shows its likelihood. Of the extremest  limit of possible prejudice, names may serve as examples. It sounds  funny to say that a man may be prejudiced for or against an individual  by the sound of his name, but it is true. Who will deny that he has been  inclined to favor people because they bore a beloved name, and who has  not heard remarks like, “The very name of that fellow makes me sick.” I  remember clearly two cases. In one, Patriz Sevenpounder and Emmerenzia  Hinterkofler were accused of swindling, and my first notion was that  such honorable names could not possibly belong to people guilty of  swindling. The opposite case was one in which a deposition concerning  some attack upon him was signed by Arthur Filgré. I thought at first  that the whole complaint was as windy as the complainant’s name. Again,  I know that one man did not get the job of private secretary he was  looking for because his name, as written, was Kilian Krautl. “How can a  man be decent, who has such a foolish name?” said his would-be employer.  Then again, a certain Augustinian monk, who was a favorite in a large  city, owed his popularity partly to his rhythmical cognomen Pater Peter  Pumm.    Our poets know right well the importance for us short-sighted  earth-worms of so indifferent a thing as a name, and the best among them  are very cautious about the selection and composition of names. Net the  smallest part of their effects lies in the successful tone of the names  they use. And it was not unjust to say that Bismark could not possibly  have attained his position if he had been called Maier.      Section 94. (d) Imitation and the Crowd.    The character of the instinct of imitation and its influence on the  crowd has long been studied in animals, children, and even men, and has  been recognized as a fundamental trait of intellect and the prime  condition of all education. Later on its influence on crowds was  observed, and Napoleon said, “Les crimes collectifs n’engagent  personnes.” Weber spoke of moral contagion, and it has long been known  that suicide is contagious. Baer, in his book on “Die Gefängnisse,” has  assigned the prison-suicides “imitative tendency.” There is the  remarkable fact that suicides often hang themselves on trees which have  already been used for that purpose. And in jails it is frequently  observed that after a long interval a series of suicides suddenly  appear.    The repetition of crimes, once one has been committed in a particular  way, is also frequent; among them, the crime of child-murder. If a girl  has stifled her child, ten others do so; if a girl has sat down upon it,  or has choked it by pressing it close to her breast, etc., there are  others to do likewise. Tarde believes that crime is altogether to be  explained by the laws of imitation. It is still unknown where imitation  and the principles of statistics come into contact, and it is with  regard to this contact we find our greatest difficulties. When several  persons commit murder in the same way we call it imitation, but when  definite forms of disease or wounds have for years not been noticed in  hospitals and then suddenly appear in numbers, we call it duplication.  Hospital physicians are familiar with this phenomenon and count on the  appearance of a second case of any disease if only a first occurs.  Frequently such diseases come from the same region and involve the same  extraordinary abnormalities, so that nothing can be said about  imitation. Now, how can imitation and duplication be distinguished in  individual cases? Where are their limits? Where do they touch, where  cover each other? Where do the groups form?    There is as yet no solution for the crimino-political interpretation of  the problems of imitation, and for its power to excuse conduct as being  conduct’s major basis. But the problems have considerable symptomatic  and diagnostic value. At the very least, we shall be able to find the  sole possibility of the explanation of the nature or manner of a crime  in the origin of the stimulus to some particular imitation. Among  youthful persons, women especially, there will be some anticipatory  image which serves as a plan, and this will explain at least the  otherwise inexplicable and superfluous concomitants like unnecessary  cruelty and destruction. The knowledge of this anticipatory image may  give even a clew to the criminal, for it may indicate the nature of the  person who could act it out and realize it. Also in our field there  exists “duplication of cases.”    The condition of action in great crowds offers remarkable  characteristics. The most instructive are the great misfortunes in which  almost every unhappy individual conducts himself, not only irrationally  but, objectively taken, criminally towards his fellows, inasmuch as he  sacrifices them to his own safety without being in real need. To this  class belong the crossing of bridges by retreating troops in which the  cavalry stupidly ride down their own comrades in order to get through.  Again, there are the well-known accidents, e.g., at the betrothal of  Louis XVI., in which 1200 people were killed in the crush, the fires at  the betrothal of Napoleon, in the Viennese Ringtheater in 1881, and the  fire on the picnic-boat “General Slocum,” in 1904. In each of these  cases horrible scenes occurred, because of the senseless conduct of  terrified people. It is said simply and rightly, by the Styrian poet,  “One individual is a man, a few are people, many are cattle.” In his  book on imitation, Tarde says, “In crowds, the calmest people do the  silliest things,” and in 1892, at the congress for criminal  anthropology, “The crowd is never frontal and rarely occipital; it is  mainly spinal. It always contains something childish, puerile, quite  feminine.” He, Garnier, and Dekterew, showed at the same congress how  frequently the mob is excited to all possible excesses by lunatics and  drunkards. Lombroso, Laschi, etc., tell of many cruelties which  rebelling crowds committed without rhyme or reason.[307] The “soul of  the crowd,” just recently invented, is hardly different from  Schopenhauer’s Macroanthropos, and it is our important task to determine  how much the anthropos and how much the macroanthropos is to be blamed  for any crime.      Section 95. (e) Passion and Affection.    Passion and affection occasion in our own minds and in those of  witnesses considerable confusion of observations, influence, or even  effect the guilt of the defendant and serve to explain many things at  the moment of examination. The essence of passion or affection, its  definition and influence, its physical and physiological explanation, is  discussed in any psychology. The use of this discussion for the lawyer’s  purposes has been little spoken of, and possibly can not have more said  about it. Things that are done with passion show themselves as such, and  require no particular examination in that respect. What we have to do is  to discover what might have happened without passion, and especially to  protect ourselves from being in person overcome by passion or affection.  It is indubitable that the most “temperamental” of the criminalists are  the best, for phlegm and melancholy do not carry one through an  examination. The lively and the passionate judges are the most  effective, but they also have the defects of their virtues. No one will  deny that it is difficult to maintain a calm demeanor with an impudent  denying criminal, or in the face of some very cruel, unhuman, or  terrible crime. But it is essential to surmount this difficulty.  Everyone of us must recall shameful memories of having, perhaps justly,  given way to passion. Of course the very temperamental Count Gideon  Raday freed his county in a short time from numberless robberies by  immediately hanging the mayor of the town in which the robberies  occurred, but nowadays so much temperament is not permissible. It is  well to recall the painful position of an excellent presiding justice at  a murder trial, who attacked the defendant passionately, and had to  submit to the latter’s really justified reprimand.    The only means of avoiding such difficulties is not to begin  quarrelling. Just as soon as a single word is uttered which is in any  way improper in polite society, everything is lost. The word is the  rolling snow-ball, and how much momentum it may gather depends upon the  nature and the training of the judge. Lonely insults are not frequent,  and a single improper word breaks down the boundaries. The criminal  knows this and often makes use of his knowledge. A man who has “cussed  out” the other fellow is no longer dangerous, he becomes calm and kind,  and feels instinctively the need of repairing the damage he has  committed by “going too far.” He then exhibits an exaggerated geniality  and care upon which many criminals count, and hence intentionally  provoke the examiner until he does things and says things he is sorry  for.    The emotions of witnesses, especially of those who have been harmed by  the crime and of those who have seen something terrible and disgusting,  and who still tend to get excited over it, constitute a great many  difficulties. Against the unconditional reliability of such persons’  testimony experienced judges take measures of defence. The participant  of this class is never calm; passion, anxiety, anger, personal interest,  etc., either anticipate or exaggerate trouble. Of course, we are not  speaking of cases in which a wound is considerably exaggerated, or even  invented for the sake of money, but of those in which people under  emotional stress often say unthinkable things about their enemy, just to  get him punished. This, however, is comparatively rare where the damage  has been very great. A man who has lost his eye, the father of a raped  daughter, the victim impoverished by arson, often behaves very calmly  toward the criminal. He makes no especial accusation, does not  exaggerate, and does not insult. A person, however, whose orchard has  suffered damage, may behave much worse.    It frequently happens that the sufferer and the defendant really hate  each other. Not necessarily because one had broken the other’s head, or  robbed him; frequently the ostensible reason for coming to trial is the  result of a long and far-reaching hatred. That this emotion can go to  any length is well known and it is therefore necessary, though not  always easy, to seek it out. Hatred is possible among peers, or people  who are peers in one connection or another. As a rule, the king will not  be able to hate his musketeer, but he will when they are both  passionately in love with the same girl, for they are peers in love.  Similarly, the high-bred lady will hardly hate her maid, but if she  observes the maid’s magnificent hair and believes that it is better than  her own, she will hate the maid, for there is no difference in rank with  regard to the love of hair.    Real hate has only three sources: pain, jealousy, or love. Either the  object of hatred has caused his enemy a great irremediable pain or  jealousy, or hatred is, was, or will become love. Some authorities  believe that there is another source of hatred which becomes apparent  when we have done harm to somebody. That this might show itself as  hatred or passion similar to hatred is possible, but in most cases it  will probably be a feeling of deep shame and regret, which has certain  particular characteristics in common with hatred. If it is really  hatred, it is hatred through pain. Hatred is difficult to hide, and even  criminalists of small experience will overlook it only in exceptional  cases. The discovery of envy, which is less forgiving than hatred, less  explosive, much profounder and much more extensive, is incomparably more  difficult. Real hatred, like exquisite passion, requires temperament,  and under circumstances may evoke sympathy, but friendless envy, any  scamp is capable of. Possibly no other passion endangers and destroys so  many lives, chokes off so much service, makes impossible so many  significant things, and finally, judges so falsely an endless number of  persons. When you remember, moreover, its exaggerated extent, and the  poor-spirited, easy trick of hiding it, its dangerous nature can not be  overestimated. We lawyers are even more imperilled by it because we do  not easily allow people to be praised before us; we require witnesses,  etc., to speak incriminatingly most of the time, and we cannot easily  see whether they are envious.    However freely one man may speak against another, we may assume that he  is telling the truth, or at worst, that he has a false notion of the  matter, or was badly instructed, but we rarely think that his envy  dictates it all. This idea occurs to us when he is to praise the other  man. Then he exhibits a cautious, tentative, narrowing attitude, so that  even a person of little experience infers envy. And here the  much-discussed fact manifests itself, that real envy requires a certain  equality. By way of example the petty shop-keeper is cited as envying  his more fortunate competitor, but not the great merchant whose ships go  round the world. The feeling of the private toward his general, the  peasant toward his landlord, is not really envy, it is desire to be like  him. It is anger that the other is better off, but inasmuch as the  emotion lacks that effective capacity which we require for envy, we can  not call it envy. It becomes envy when something by way of intrigue or  evil communication, etc., has been undertaken against the envied person.  Thus the mere _feeling_ is confessed at once. People say, “How I envy  him this trip, his magnificent health, his gorgeous automobile, etc.”  They do not say: “I have enviously spoken evil of him, or done this or  that against him.” Yet it is in the latter form that the actual passion  of envy expresses itself.    The capacity of the envious for false representation makes them  particularly dangerous in the court-room. If we want to discover  anything about an individual we naturally inquire of his colleagues, his  relatives, etc. But it is just among these that envy rules. If you  inquire of people without influence you learn nothing from them, since  they do not understand the matter; if you ask professional people they  speak enviously or selfishly, and that constitutes our dilemma. Our  attention may be called to envy by the speaker’s hesitation, his  reserved manner of answering. This is the same in all classes, and is  valuable because it may warn us against very bad misunderstandings.    As a rule, nothing can be said about passion as a source of crime. We  may assume that passion passes through three periods. The first is  characterized by the general or partial recurrence of older images; in  the second, the new idea employs its dominating place negatively or  positively with respect to the older one,--the passion culminates; and  in the third, the forcibly-disturbed emotional equilibrium is restored.  Most emotions are accompanied by well-known physical phenomena. Some  have been thoroughly studied, e.g., the juristically important emotion  of fear. In fear, breathing is irregular, inspiration is frequently  broken, a series of short breaths is followed by one or more deep ones,  inspiration is short, expiration is prolonged, one or the other is  sobbing. All these phenomena are only a single consequence of the  increase of respiratory changes. The irregularity of the latter causes  coughing, then a disturbance of speech, which is induced by the  irregular action of the muscles of the jaw, and in part by the  acceleration of the breathing. In the stages of echoing fear, yawning  occurs, and the distention of the pupils may be noticed as the emotion  develops. This is what we often see when a denying defendant finds  himself confounded by evidence, etc.    The most remarkable and in no way explicable fact is, that these  phenomena do not occur in innocent people. One might think that the fear  of being innocently convicted would cause an expression of dread, anger,  etc., but it does not cause an expression of real terror. I have no  other than empirical evidence of the fact, so that many more  observations are required before any fresh inferences are deduced  therefrom anent a man’s guilt or innocence. We must never forget that  under such circumstances passions and emotions often change into their  opposites according to rule. Parsimony becomes extravagance, and  conversely; love becomes hate. Many a man becomes altogether too  foolhardy because of despairing fear. So it may happen that terror may  become petrifying coldness, and then not one of the typical marks of  terror appears. But it betrays itself just as certainly by its icy  indifference as by its own proper traits. Just as passions transmute  into their opposites, so they carry a significant company of subordinate  characteristics. Thus, dread or fear is accompanied by disorderly  impertinence, sensuality by cruelty. The latter connection is of great  importance to us, for it frequently eliminates difficulties in the  explanation of crime. That cruelty and lasciviousness have the same  root has long been known. The very ecstasy of adventurous and passionate  love is frequently connected with a certain cruel tendency. Women are,  as a rule, more ferocious than men.[308] It is asserted that a woman in  love is constantly desiring her man. If this be true, the foregoing  statement is sufficiently explained. In one sense the connection between  sexual passion and cruelty is bound up with that unsatiability which is  characteristic of several passions. It is best to be observed in  passions for property, especially such as involve the sense-perception  of money. It is quite correct to speak of the overwhelming, devilish  power of gold, of the sensual desire to roll in gold, of the  irresistible ring of coins, etc. And it is also correctly held that  money has the same definite influence on man as blood on preying  animals. We all know innumerable examples of quite decent people who  were led to serious crimes by the mere sight of a large sum of money.  Knowledge of this tendency may, on occasion, lead to clues, and even to  the personality of the criminal.      Section 96. (f) Honor.    Kant says that a man’s honor consists in what people think about him, a  woman’s in what people say about her. Another authority believes that  honor and a sense of honor are an extension of the sense of self in and  through others. The essence of my honor is my belief that I exist for  others, that my conduct will be judged and valued not only by myself but  by others. Falstaff calls honor the painted picture at a funeral. Our  authors are both right and wrong, for honor is simply the position a man  takes with regard to the world, so that even gamins may be said to have  honor. Unwillingness to see this may cause us criminalists considerable  trouble. One of the worst men I ever met in my profession, a person  guilty of the nastiest crimes, so nasty that he had driven his honorable  parents to suicide, had at the expiration of his last sentence of many  years in prison, said literally, “I offer no legal objection against the  sentence. I beg, however, for three days’ suspension so that I may write  a series of farewell letters which I could not write as a prisoner.”  Even in the heart of this man there was still the light of what other  people call honor. We often find similar things which may be used to our  advantage in examination. Not, of course, for the purpose of getting  confession, accusation of accomplices, etc. This might, indeed, serve  the interests of the case, but it is easy to identify a pliable attitude  with an honorable inclination, and the former must certainly not be  exploited, even with the best intention. Moreover, among persons of low  degree, an inclination toward decency will hardly last long and will  briefly give way to those inclinations which are habitual to bad men.  Then they are sorry for what they had permitted to occur in their better  moment and curse those who had made use of that moment.    It is often funny to see the points at which the criminal seeks his  “honor.” What is proper for a thief, may be held improper for a robber.  The burglar hates to be identified with the pick-pocket. Many a one  finds his honor in this wise deeply attacked, particularly when it is  shown him that he is betraying an accomplice, or that he has swindled  his comrades in the division of booty, etc. I remember one thief who was  inconsolable because the papers mentioned that he had foolishly  overlooked a large sum of money in a burglary. This would indicate that  criminals have professional ambitions and seek professional fame.      Section 97. (g) Superstition.

Gross’s Archiv I, 306; III, 88; IV, 340; V, 290, 207; IX,  253; IV, 168; VI, 312; VII, 162; XII, 334.      Topic 3. MISTAKES.    (a) Mistakes of the Senses.      Section 98. (1) General Considerations.    As sensation is the basis of knowledge, the sensory process must be the  basis of the correctness of legal procedure. The information we get from  our senses and on which we construct our conclusion, may be said, all in  all, to be reliable, so that we are not justified in approaching things  we assume to depend on sense-perception with exaggerated caution.  Nevertheless, this perception is not always completely correct, and the  knowledge of its mistakes must help us and even cause us to wonder that  we make no greater ones.    Psychological examination of sense-perception has been going on since  Heraclitus. Most of the mistakes discovered have been used for various  purposes, from sport to science. They are surprising and attract and  sustain public attention; they have, hence, become familiar, but their  influence upon other phenomena and their consequences in the daily life  have rarely been studied. For two reasons. First, because such illusions  seem to be small and their far-reaching effects are rarely thought of,  as when, e.g., a line drawn on paper seems longer or more inclined than  it really is. Secondly, it is supposed that the influence of sensory  illusions can not easily make a difference in practical life. If the  illusion is observed it is thereby rendered harmless and can have no  effect. If it is not observed and later on leads to serious  consequences, their cause can not possibly be sought out, because it can  not be recognized as such, and because there have been so many  intermediate steps that a correct retroduction is impossible.    This demonstrates the rarity of a practical consideration of  sense-perception, but does not justify that rarity. Of course, there are  great difficulties in applying results of limited experiments to  extensive conditions. They arise from the assumption that the conditions  will be similar to those which the scientist studies, and that a  situation which exhibits certain phenomena under narrow experimental  conditions will show them, also, in the large. But this is not the case,  and it is for this reason that the results of modern psychology have  remained practically unproductive. This, of course, is not a reproach to  the discipline of experimental psychology, or an assault upon the value  of its researches. Its narrow limitations were necessary if anything  definite was to be discovered. But once this has been discovered the  conditions may be extended and something practical may be attained to,  particularly in the matter of illusion of sense. And this possibility  disposes of the second reason for not paying attention to these  illusions.    Witnesses do not of course know that they have suffered from illusions  of sense; we rarely hear them complain of it, anyway. And it is for this  very reason that the criminalist must seek it out. The requirement  involves great difficulties for we get very little help from the immense  literature on the subject. There are two roads to its fulfilment. In the  first place, we must understand the phenomenon as it occurs in our work,  and by tracing it back determine whether and which illusion of the sense  may have caused an abnormal or otherwise unclear fact. The other road is  the theoretical one, which must be called, in this respect, the  preparatory road. It requires our mastery of all that is known of  sense-illusion and particularly of such examples of its hidden nature as  exist. Much of the material of this kind is, however, irrelevant to our  purpose, particularly all that deals with disease and lies in the field  of medicine. Of course, where the nature of the disease is uncertain or  its very presence is unknown, it is as well for us to consider the case  as for the physician. But above all, it is our duty to consult the  physician.    Apart from what belongs to the physician there is the material which  concerns other professions than ours. That must be set aside, though  increasing knowledge may require us to make use even of that. It is  indubitable that we make many observations in which we get the absolute  impression that matters of sensory illusion which do not seem to concern  us lie behind some witnesses’ observations, etc., although we can not  accurately indicate what they are. The only thing to do when this occurs  is either to demonstrate the possibility of their presence or to wait  for some later opportunity to test the witness for them.    Classification will ease our task a great deal. The apparently most  important divisions are those of “normal” and “abnormal.” But as the  boundary between them is indefinite, it would be well to consider that  there is a third class which can not fall under either heading. This is  a class where especially a group of somatic conditions either favor or  cause illusory sense-perceptions, e.g., a rather over-loaded stomach, a  rush of blood to the head, a wakeful night, physical or mental  over-exertion. These conditions are not abnormal or diseased, but as  they are not habitual, they are not normal either. If the overloaded  stomach has turned into a mild indigestion, the increase of blood into  congestion, etc., then we are very near disease, but the boundary  between that and the other condition can not be determined.    Another question is the limit at which illusions of sense begin, how,  indeed, they can be distinguished from correct perceptions. The  possibility of doing so depends upon the typical construction of the  sense-organs in man. By oneself it would be impossible to determine  which sensation is intrinsically correct and which is an illusion. There  are a great many illusions of sense which all men suffer from under  similar conditions, so that the judgment of the majority can not be  normative. Nor can the control of one sense by another serve to  distinguish illusory from correct perception. In many cases it is quite  possible to test the sense of sight by touch, or the sense of hearing by  sight, but that is not always so. The simplest thing is to say that a  sense-impression is correct and implies reality when it remains  identical under various circumstances, in various conditions, when  connected with other senses, and observed by different men, with  different instruments. It is illusory when it is not so constant. But  here again the limit of the application of the term “illusion” is  difficult to indicate. That distant things seem to be smaller than they  are; that railway tracks and two sides of a street seem to run together  are intrinsically real illusions of sense, but they are not so  called--they are called the laws of perspective, so that it would seem  that we must add to the notion of sense-perception that of rarity, or  extraordinary appearance.    I have found still another distinction which I consider important. It  consists in the difference between real illusions and those false  conceptions in which the mistake originates as false inference. In the  former the sense organ has been really registering wrongly, as when, for  example, the pupil of the eye is pressed laterally and everything is  seen double. But when I see a landscape through a piece of red glass,  and believe the landscape to be really red, the mistake is one of  inference only, since I have not included the effect of the glass in my  concluding conception. So again, when in a rain I believe mountains to  be nearer than they really are, or when I believe the stick in the water  to be really bent, my sensations are perfectly correct, but my  inferences are wrong. In the last instance, even a photograph will show  the stick in water as bent.    This difference in the nature of illusion is particularly evident in  those phenomena of expectation that people tend to miscall “illusions of  sense.” If, in church, anybody hears a dull, weak tone, he will believe  that the organ is beginning to sound, because it is appropriate to  assume that. In the presence of a train of steam cars which shows every  sign of being ready to start you may easily get the illusion that it is  already going. Now, how is the sense to have been mistaken in such  cases? The ear has really heard a noise, the eye has really seen a  train, and both have registered correctly, but it is not their function  to qualify the impression they register, and if the imagination then  effects a false inference, that can not be called an illusion of  sensation.    The incorrectness of such classification becomes still more obvious when  some numerical, arithmetical demonstration can be given of the presence  of faulty inference. For example, if I see through the window a man very  far away clearing a lot with an ax, I naturally see the ax fall before I  hear the noise of the blow. Now, it may happen that the distance may be  just great enough to make me hear the sound of the second blow at the  moment in which I see the delivery of the third blow. Thus I perceive at  the same moment, in spite of the great distance, both the phenomena of  light and of sound, just as if I were directly on the spot. Perhaps I  will wonder at first about these physical anomalies, and then, if I have  made my simple mistake in inference, I shall tell somebody about the  remarkable “sensory illusion” I had today, although no one had ever  supposed me capable of being deceived in this way. Schopenhauer calls  attention to the familiar fact that on waking after a short nap all  localizations are apparently perverted, and the mind does not know what  is in front, what behind, what to the right, and what to the left. To  call also this sensory illusion, would again be wrong, since the mind is  not fully awake, and sufficiently orientated to know clearly its  condition. The matter is different when we do not properly estimate an  uncustomary sense-impression. A light touch in an unaccustomed part of  the body is felt as a heavy weight. After the loss of a tooth we feel an  enormous cave in the mouth, and what a nonsensical idea we have of what  is happening when the dentist is drilling a hole in a tooth! In all  these cases the senses have received a new impression which they have  not yet succeeded in judging properly, and hence, make a false  announcement of the object. It is to this fact that all fundamentally  incorrect judgments of new impressions must be attributed,--for example,  when we pass from darkness into bright light and find it very sharp;  when we find a cellar warm in winter that we believe to be ice-cold in  summer; when we suppose ourselves to be high up in the air the first  time we are on horseback, etc. Now, the actual presence of sensory  illusions is especially important to us because we must make certain  tests to determine whether testimony depends on them or not, and it is  of great moment to know whether the illusions depend on the individual’s  mind or on his senses. We may trust a man’s intellect and not his  senses, and conversely, from the very beginning.    It would be superfluous to talk of the importance of sensory illusion in  the determination of a sentence. The correctness of the judgment depends  on the correctness of the transmitted observations, and to understand  the nature of sense-illusion and its frequency is to know its  significance for punishment. There are many mistakes of judges based  entirely on ignorance of this matter. Once a man who claimed, in spite  of absolute darkness, to have recognized an opponent who punched him in  the eye, was altogether believed, simply because it was assumed that the  punch was so vigorous that the wounded man saw sparks by the light of  which he could recognize the other. And yet already Aristotle knew that  such sparks are only subjective. But that such things were believed is a  notable warning.[309]      Section 99. (2) _Optical Illusions._    It will be best to begin the study of optical illusions with the  consideration of those conditions which cause extraordinary, lunatic  images. They are important because the illusion is recognizable with  respect to the possibility of varied interpretations by any observer,  and because anybody may experiment for himself with a bit of paper on  the nature of false optical apprehension. If we should demonstrate no  more than that the simplest conditions often involve coarse mistakes,  much will have been accomplished for the law, since the “irrefutable  evidence” of our senses would then show itself to need corroboration.  Nothing is proved with “I have seen it myself,” for a mistake in one  point shows the equal possibility of mistakes in all other points.    Generally, it may be said that the position of lines is not without  influence on the estimation of their size.[310] Perpendicular dimensions  are taken to be somewhat greater than they are. Of two crossed lines,  the vertical one seems longer, although it is really equal to the  horizontal one. An oblong, lying on its somewhat longer side, is taken  to be a square; if we set it on the shorter side it seems to be still  more oblong than it really is. If we divide a square into equal angles  we take the nearer horizontal ones to be larger, so that we often take  an angle of thirty degrees to be forty-five. Habit has much influence  here. It will hardly be believed, and certainly is not consciously  known, that in the letter S the upper curve has a definitely smaller  radius than the lower one; but the inverted S shows this at once. To  such types other false estimations belong: inclinations, roofs, etc.,  appear so steep in the distance that it is said to be impossible to move  on them without especial help. But whoever does move on them finds the  inclination not at all so great. Hence, it is necessary, whenever the  ascension of some inclined plane is declared impossible, to inquire  whether the author of the declaration was himself there, or whether he  had judged the thing at a distance.    Slight crooks are underestimated. Exner[311] rightly calls attention to  the fact that in going round the rotunda of the Viennese Prater, he  always reached the exit much sooner than he expected. This is due to the  presence of slight deviations and on them are based the numerous false  estimates of distance and the curious fact that people, on being lost at  night in the woods, go round in a significantly small circle. It is  frequently observed that persons, who for one reason or another, i.e.,  robbery, maltreatment, a burglarious assault, etc., had fled into the  woods to escape, found themselves at daybreak, in spite of their flight,  very near the place of the crime, so that their honesty in fleeing seems  hardly believable. Nevertheless it may be perfectly trustworthy, even  though in the daytime the fugitive might be altogether at home in the  woods. He has simply underestimated the deviations he has made, and  hence believes that he has moved at most in a very flat arc. Supposing  himself to be going forward and leaving the wood, he has really been  making a sharp arc, and always in the same direction, so that his path  has really been circular.    Some corroboration for this illusion is supplied by the fact that the  left eye sees objects on the left too small, while the right eye  underestimates the right side of objects. This underestimation varies  from 0.3 to 0.7%. These are magnitudes which may naturally be of  importance, and which in the dark most affect deviations that are  closely regarded on the inner side of the eye--i.e., deviations to the  left of the left eye or the right of the right eye.    Such confusions become most troublesome when other estimations are added  to them. So long as the informant knows that he has only been  estimating, the danger is not too great. But as a rule the informant  does not regard his conception as an estimate, but as certain knowledge.  He does not say, “I estimate,” he says, “It is so.” Aubert tells how the  astronomer Förster had a number of educated men, physicians, etc.,  estimate the diameter of the moon. The estimation varied from 1´´ to 8´´  and more. The proper diameter is 1.5´´ at a distance of 12´´.    It is well known that an unfurnished room seems much smaller than a  furnished one, and a lawn covered with snow, smaller than a  thickly-grown one. We are regularly surprised when we find an enormous  new structure on an apparently small lot, or when a lot is parcelled out  into smaller building lots. When they are planked off we marvel at the  number of planks which can be laid on the surface. The illusions are  still greater when we look upward. We are less accustomed to estimation  of verticals than of horizontals. An object on the gutter of a roof  seems much smaller than at a similar distance on the ground. This can be  easily observed if any figure which has been on the roof of a house for  years is once brought down. Even if it is horizontally twice as far as  the height of the house, the figure still seems larger than before. That  this illusion is due to defective practice is shown by the fact that  children make mistakes which adults find inconceivable. Helmholtz tells  how, as child, he asked his mother to get him the little dolls from the  gallery of a very high tower. I remember myself that at five years I  proposed to my comrades to hold my ankles so that I could reach for a  ball from the second story of a house down to the court-yard. I had  estimated the height as one-twelfth of its actual magnitude. Certain  standards of under and overestimations are given us when there is near  the object to be judged an object the size of which we know. The reason  for the fact that trees and buildings get such ideal sizes on so-called  heroic landscape is the artistically reduced scale. I know that few  pictures have made such a devilish impression on me as an enormous  landscape, something in the style of Claude Lorraine, covering half a  wall. In its foreground there is to be seen a clerk riding a horse in a  glen. Rider and horse are a few inches high, and because of this the  already enormous landscape becomes frightfully big. I saw the picture as  a student, and even now I can describe all its details. Without the  diminutive clerk it would have had no particular effect.    In this connection we must not forget that the relations of magnitude of  things about us are, because of perspective, so uncertain that we no  longer pay any attention to them. “I find it difficult,” says  Lipps,[312] “to believe that the oven which stands in the corner of the  room does not look larger than my hand when I hold it a foot away from  my eyes, or that the moon is not larger than the head of a pin, which I  look at a little more closely.... We must not forget how we are in the  custom of comparing. I compare hand and oven, and I think of the hand in  terms of the oven.” That is because we know how large the hand and the  oven are, but very often we compare things the sizes of which we do not  know, or which we can not so easily get at, and then there are many  extraordinary illusions.    In connection with the cited incident of the estimation of the moon’s  diameter, there is the illusion of Thomas Reid who saw that the moon  seemed as large as a plate when looked at with the unhampered eye, but  as large as a dollar when looked at through a tube. This mistake  establishes the important fact that the size of the orifice influences  considerably the estimation of the size of objects seen through it.  Observations through key-holes are not rarely of importance in criminal  cases. The underestimations of sizes are astonishing.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    Aërial perspective has a great influence on the determination of these  phenomena, particularly such as occur in the open and at great  distances. The influence is to be recognized through the various  appearances of distant objects, the various colors of distant mountains,  the size of the moon on the horizon, and the difficulties which aërial  perspective offers painters. Many a picture owes its success or failure  to the use of aërial perspective. If its influence is significant in the  small space of a painting, the illusions in nature can easily become of  enormous significance, particularly when extremes are brought together  in the observations of objects in unknown regions. The condition of the  air, sometimes foggy and not pellucid, at another time particularly  clear, makes an enormous difference, and statements whether about  distance, size, colors, etc., are completely unreliable. A witness who  has several times observed an unknown region in murky weather and has  made his important observation under very clear skies, is not to be  trusted.    An explanation of many sensory illusions may be found in the so-called  illusory lines. They have been much studied, but Zöllner[313] has been  the first to show their character. Thus, really quite parallel lines are  made to appear unparallel by the juxtaposition of inclined or crossing  lines. In figures 1 and 2 both the horizontal lines are actually  parallel, as may be determined in various ways.    The same lines looked at directly or backwards seem, in Fig. 1, convex,  in Fig. 2 concave.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    Still more significant is the illusion in Fig. 3, in which the convexity  is very clear. The length, etc., of the lines makes no difference in the  illusion.    On the other hand, in Fig. 4 the diagonals must be definitely thicker  than the parallel horizontal lines, if those are to appear not parallel.  That the inclination is what destroys the appearance of parallels is  shown by the simple case given in Fig. 5, where the distance from A to B  is as great as from B to C, and yet where the first seems definitely  smaller than the second.    Still more deceptive is Fig. 6, where the first line with the angle  inclined inwards seems incomparably smaller than the second with the  angle inclined outwards.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    All who have described this remarkable subject have attempted to explain  it. The possession of such an explanation might put us in a position to  account for a large number of practical difficulties. But certain as the  facts are, we are still far from their _why_ and _how_. We may believe  that the phenomenon shown in Figs. 1 and 2 appears when the boundaries  of a field come straight up to a street with parallel sides, with the  result that at the point of meeting the street seems to be bent in.  Probably we have observed this frequently without being aware of it, and  have laid no particular stress on it, first of all, because it was  really unimportant, and secondly, because we thought that the street was  really not straight at that point.    In a like manner we may have seen the effect of angles as shown in Figs.  5 and 6 on streets where houses or house-fronts were built cornerwise.  Then the line between the corners seemed longer or shorter, and as we  had no reason for seeking an accurate judgment we paid no attention to  its status. We simply should have made a false estimate of length if we  had been required to judge it. It is also likely that we may have  supposed an actual or suppository line on the side of the gables of a  house enclosed by angles of the gables, to be short,--but until now the  knowledge of this supposition has had no practical value. Nevertheless,  the significance of these illusions should not be underestimated. They  mean most of all the fact that we really can be much deceived, even to  the degree of swearing to the size of a simple thing and yet being quite  innocently mistaken. This possibility shows, moreover, that the  certainty of our judgment according to sensible standards is inadequate  and we have no way of determining how great this inadequacy is. We have  already indicated that we know only the examples cited by Zöllner,  Delboeuf and others. It is probable that they were hit upon by accident  and that similar ones can not be discovered empirically or  intentionally. Hence, it may be assumed that such illusions occur in  great number and even in large dimensions. For example, it is known that  Thompson discovered his familiar “optical circle illusion” (six circles  arranged in a circle, another in the middle. Each possesses bent radii  which turn individually if the whole drawing is itself turned in a  circle) by the accident of having seen the geometrical ornament drawn by  a pupil. Whoever deals with such optical illusions may see very  remarkable ones in almost every sample of ladies’ clothes, particularly  percale, and also in types of carpets and furniture. And these are too  complicated to be described. In the course of time another collection of  such illusions will be discovered and an explanation of them will be  forthcoming, and then it may be possible to determine how our knowledge  of their existence can be turned to practical use.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    Practical application is easier in the so-called inversion of the visual  object. Fig. 7 shows the simplest case of it--the possibility of seeing  the middle vertical line as either deeper or higher than the others. In  the first instance you have before you a gutter, in the second a room.  Similar relations are to be observed in the case of a cube in which the  corner _a_ may be seen as either convex or concave according as you  think it behind or before the background of the angles from which _a_  proceeds. It is still clearer when, in a rhomboid, the line _XY_ is  drawn. Then _x_ or _y_ may be seen alternately as nearer or further and  the figure can thereby be brought into a different position. (Fig. 9.)  Done once it may be repeated voluntarily.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    There are many practical examples of these illusions. Sinsteden saw one  evening the silhouette of a windmill against a luminous background. The  arms seemed now to go to the right, now to the left--clearly because he  did not make out the body of the mill and might equally assume that he  saw it from the front or from the rear, the wheels going toward the  right in the first, and toward the left in the other case. An analogous  case is cited by Bernstein. If (Fig. 10) the cross made of the thin  lines stand for the bars of a weather vane and the heavy lines represent  the weather vane itself, it may be impossible under the conditions of  illumination for an eye looking from N to distinguish whether the  weather vane points NE or SW; there is no way of determining the  starting point of motion. All that can certainly be said is that the  weather vane lies between NE and SW and that its angle is at the  crossing of the two lines, but the direction in which its heads point  can not be determined at even a slight distance. Both forms of this  illusion may occur in a criminal trial. If once a definite idea of some  form of order has been gained, it is not abandoned or doubted, and is  even sworn to. If asked, for example, whether the mill-wheel moved right  or left, the observer will consider hardly one time in a hundred whether  there might not have been an optical illusion. He will simply assure us  that the thing was as he thinks he saw it, and whether he saw it  correctly is purely a matter of luck.    To all these illusions may be added those which are connected with  movement or are exposed by movement. During the movement of certain  bodies we can distinguish their form only under definite conditions. As  their movement increases they seem shorter in the direction of movement  and as it decreases they seem broader than normally. An express train  with many cars seems shorter when moving directly near us, and rows of  marching men seem longer. The illusion is most powerful when we look  through a stationary small opening. The same thing occurs when we move  quickly past bodies, for this makes them seem very short as we go by.    Of such cases sense-illusion does not constitute an adequate  explanation; it must be supplemented by a consideration of certain  inferences which are, in most instances, comparatively complex.[314] We  know, e.g. that objects which appear to us unexpectedly at night,  particularly on dark, cloudy nights, seem inordinately magnified. The  process is here an exceedingly complex one. Suppose I see, some cloudy  night, unexpectedly close to me a horse whose environment, because of  the fog, appears indistinct. Now I know from experience that objects  which appear from indistinct environments are as a rule considerably  distant. I know, further, that considerably distant objects seem much  smaller, and hence I must assume that the horse, which in spite of its  imaginary distance appears to retain its natural size, is really larger  than it is. The train of thought is as follows: “I see the horse  indistinctly. It seems to be far away. It is, in spite of its distance,  of great size. How enormous it must be when it is close to me!” Of  course these inferences are neither slow nor conscious. They occur in  reflection with lightning-like swiftness and make no difference to the  certainty of the instantaneous judgment. Hence it is frequently very  difficult to discover the process and the mistake it contains.    If, however, the observer finds an inexplicable hiatus in an event he  happens to notice, he finds it strange because unintelligible. In this  way is created that notion of strangeness which often plays so great a  rôle in the examination of witnesses. Hence when under otherwise  uncomfortable conditions, I see a horse run without hearing the beat of  his hoofs, when I see trees sway without feeling any storm; when I meet  a man who, in spite of the moonlight, has no shadow, I feel them to be  very strange because something is lacking in their logical development  as events. Now, from the moment a thing becomes strange to an individual  his perceptions are no longer reliable, it is doubtful whether he knows  what he has really experienced before his world became strange to him.  Add to this that few people are unwilling to confess that they felt ill  at ease, that perhaps they do not even know it,[315] and you get the  complicated substitution of sensory illusions and uncanny sensation, the  one causing the other, the other magnifying the one, and so on until the  whole affair is turned into something quite unrecognizable. So we find  ourselves in the presence of one of the inexplicable situations of the  reality of which we are assured by the most trustworthy individuals.    To magnify this phenomenon, we need only think of a few slightly  abnormal cases. It has already been indicated that there are many such  which are not diseased, and further, that many diseased cases occur  which are not known as such, at least, as being so much so as to make  the judge call in the doctor. This is the more likely because there are  frequently, if I may say so, localized diseases which do not exhibit any  extraordinary symptoms, at least to laymen, and hence offer no reason  for calling in experts. If we set aside all real diseases which are  connected with optical illusions as not concerning us, there are still  left instances enough. For example, any medical text-book will tell you  that morphine fiends and victims of the cocaine habit have very strong  tendencies to optical illusions and are often tortured by them. If the  disease is sufficiently advanced, such subjects will be recognized by  the physician at a single glance. But the layman can not make this  immediate diagnosis. He will get the impression that he is dealing with  a very nervous invalid, but not with one who is subject to optical  illusions. So, we rarely hear from a witness that he knows such people,  and certainly not that he is one himself. A very notable oculist, Himly,  was the first to have made the observation that in the diseased  excitability of the retina every color is a tone higher. Luminous black  looks blue, blue looks violet, violet looks red, red looks yellow.  Torpor of the retina inverts the substitution.    Dietz[316] tells of color-illusions following upon insignificant  indigestion; Foderè of hysterics who see everything reversed, and  Hoppe[317] says, “If the order of the rods and cones of the retina is  somewhat disturbed by an inflammatory touch, the equilibrium of vision  is altered and changes in size, in form, or appearance occur.”  Naturally the criminalist can not perceive slight indigestion, weak  hysteria, or an inflamed area in the retina when he is examining  witnesses, yet false observations like those described may have a  definite influence upon the decision in a case.    If such abnormal occasions are lacking the reasons for optical illusions  are of another nature. As a rule optical illusions occur when there is  an interruption in the communication between the retina, the sense of  movement, and the sense of touch, or when we are prevented from reducing  the changes of the retinal image to the movement of our body or of our  eyes. This reduction goes on so unconsciously that we see the idea of  the object and its condition as a unit. Again, it is indubitable that  the movement of the body seems quicker when we observe it with a fixed  glance than when we follow it with our eyes. The difference may be so  significant that it is often worth while, when much depends on  determining the speed of some act in a criminal case, to ask how the  thing was looked at.    Fechner has made a far-reaching examination of the old familiar fact  that things on the ground appear to run when we ride by them  rapidly.[318] This fact may be compared with the other, that when you  look directly into swift-moving water from a low bridge, the latter  seems all of a sudden to be swimming rapidly up stream, though the water  does not appear to stand still. Here some unknown factor is at work and  may exercise considerable influence on many other phenomena without our  being able to observe the results. To this class may be added the  extraordinary phenomenon that from the train objects easily seem too  near and hence appear smaller than they are. It may be, however, that  the converse is true and objects appear smaller, or at least shorter,  and that inasmuch as we are in the habit of attributing the diminution  of size in objects to their distance, we tax the latter as false. So  much is certain--that whenever we ourselves move quickly we make false  judgments of size, distance, and even color. The last may be due to the  fact that during a quick passage, colors may so compose themselves, that  green and red become white, and blue and yellow, green, etc. I believe  that all these illusions are increasing in connection with the spread of  bicycling, inasmuch as many observations are made from the fleeting  wheel and its motion tends to increase the illusions considerably.  Concerning the differences in movement Stricker[319] says: “If I lie on  my back and see a bird fly in the uniformly blue heaven, I recognize the  movement although I have no object with which to compare it. This can  not be explained by the variety of points on the retina which are  affected, for when the bird pauses and I turn my eye, I know that it is  not moving.” The last argument is not correct. If the bird is sitting on  a branch I know, in spite of all my occipital movement, that it is  quiet, but only because I perceive and observe the bird’s immobility.  If, however, I lie on my back like Stricker and see above me a bird of  the class that, so to speak, swim motionless in the air for minutes at a  time, and if then I turn my head, I can not tell when the bird begins to  move. Here then we have no exception to the general rule and can always  say that we are speaking of movement optically perceived when the rays  issuing from any body progressively touch various points on the retina.  And since this occurs when we are in motion as well as when the object  is in motion it happens that we can not locate the movement, we cannot  say whether it be in us or in the object.    Of course, the possibility that fanciful images may appear during  movement is familiar. If I sit quietly in the forest and at some  distance see a stone or a piece of wood or a little heap of dried  leaves, etc., it may be that, because of some illusion, I take it to be  a rolled up hedgehog, and it may happen that I am so convinced of the  nature of the object while I am looking at it that I see how the  hedgehog stretches itself, sticks out its paws and makes other  movements. I remember one winter when, because of some delay, a  commission on which I was serving had failed to reach a village not far  from the capital. We had gone to investigate a murder case and had found  the body frozen stiff. The oven in the room was heated and the  grave-digger placed the stiff body near the oven in order to thaw it  out. We at this time were examining the place. After a while I was  instructed by the examining justice to see about the condition of the  corpse, and much to my disgust, I found it sitting near the oven, bent  over. It had thawed out and collapsed. During the subsequent obduction I  saw most clearly how the corpse made all kinds of movements, and even  after the section, during the dictation, of the protocol, my imagination  still seemed to see the corpse moving a hand or a foot.    The imagination may also cause changes in color. Once, I saw on my desk,  which stood next to a window, a great round drop of water on the left  side of which the panes of the window were reflected. (Fig. 11). The  whole business was about a meter from my eye. I saw it repeatedly while  working and it finally occurred to me to inquire how such a great drop  of water could get there. I had sat at my desk for hours without moving.  I must have observed it if it had dropped there. Refraining  intentionally from going closer, I started, without avail, to consider  how it could have come. Some time after I examined the drop of water and  found it to be an ink-blot, long ago completely dried, and bearing on  its left side a few grains of white cigar ash. I had taken these to be  the image of the window, and hence, had immediately attached to it the  idea of the shining, raised drop of water. I had altogether overlooked  the deep black color of the drop. On the witness stand I would have  sworn that I had seen a drop of water, even if I had known the evidence  on the matter to be important.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    In many cases it is possible to control the imagination, but only when  it is known that the images can not be as they are seen. Everybody is  aware how a half-covered object at a distance, or objects accidentally  grouped in one way or another, are taken for God knows what. Thus once,  looking from my desk to my smoking table, I saw an enormous pair of  tailor’s scissors half-covered by a letter. It remained identical under  a number of repeated glances. Only when I thought vigorously that such a  thing could not possibly be in my room did it disappear. A few scales of  ashes, the lower round of the match safe, the metal trimmings of two  cigar boxes half-covered by a letter and reflected by the uncertain  light breaking through the branches of a tree, were all that the  tailor’s scissors was composed of. If there had been such a thing in the  house, or if I had believed something like it to exist in the house, I  should have sought no further and should have taken my oath that I had  seen the thing. It is significant that from the moment I understood the  phenomenon I could not restore the image of the scissors. How often may  similar things be of importance in criminal trials!    The so-called captivation of our visual capacity plays a not unimportant  part in distinguishing correct from illusory seeing. In order to see  correctly we must look straight and fully at the object. Looking askance  gives only an approximate image, and permits the imagination free play.  Anybody lost in a brown study who pictures some point in the room across  the way with his eyes can easily mistake a fly, which he sees confusedly  askance, for a great big bird. Again, the type of a book seems  definitely smaller if the eyes are fixed on the point of a lead pencil  with a certain distance before or above the book. And yet again, if you  stand so that at an angle of about 90 degrees from the fixation point,  you look at a white door in a dark wall, observing its extent in  indirect vision, you will find it much higher than in direct vision.    These examples indicate how indirect vision may be corrected by later  correct vision, but such correction occurs rarely. We see something  indirectly; we find it uninteresting, and do not look at it directly.  When it becomes of importance later on, perhaps enters into a criminal  case, we think that we have seen the thing as it is, and often swear  that “a fly is a big bird.”    There are a number of accidents which tend to complete illusion. Suppose  that the vision of a fly, which has been seen indirectly and taken for a  big bird happens to be synchronous with the shriek of some bird of prey.  I combine the two and am convinced that I have seen that bird of prey.  This may increase, so much so that we may have series of  sense-illusions. I cite the example of the decorative theatrical artist,  who can make the most beautiful images with a few, but very  characteristic blots. He does it by emphasising what seems to us  characteristic, e.g., of a rose arbor, in such a way that at the  distance and under the conditions of illumination of the theatre we  imagine we really see a pretty rose arbor. If the scene painter could  give definite rules he would help us lawyers a great deal. But he has  none, he proceeds according to experience, and is unable to correct  whatever mistakes he has committed. If the rose arbor fails to make the  right impression, he does not try to improve it--he makes a new one.  This may lead to the conclusion that not all people require the same  characteristics in order to identify a thing as such, so that if we  could set the rose arbor on the stage by itself, only a part of the  public would recognize it as properly drawn, the other part would  probably not recognize it at all. But if, of an evening, there is a  large number of decorations on the stage, the collective public will  find the arbor to be very pretty. That will be because the human senses,  under certain circumstances, are susceptible to sympathetic induction.  In the case of the rose arbor we may assume that the artist has  typically represented the necessary characteristics of the arbor for one  part of the audience, for another part those of a castle, for another  part those of a forest, and for a fourth those of a background. But once  an individual finds a single object to be correct, his senses are  already sympathetically inductive, i.e., captivated for the correctness  of the whole collection, so that the correctness passes from one object  to the total number. Now, this psychic process is most clear in those  optical illusions which recently have been much on public exhibition  (the Battle of Gravelotte, the Journey of the Austrian Crown Prince in  Egypt, etc.). The chief trick of these representations is the presenting  of real objects, like stones, wheels, etc., in the foreground in such a  way that they fuse unnoticeably with the painted picture. The sense of  the spectator rests on the plastic objects, is convinced of their  materiality and transfers the idea of this plastic",39.4,15.2,15.6,10.75,17.3,6.12,4525,11.4,14.96,15th and 16th grade
15,The Waste Landr,"spectator and not indeed a        “character,” is yet the most important personage in the poem,        uniting all the rest. Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of        currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not        wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women        are one woman, and the two sexes meet in Tiresias.  What Tiresias        _sees_, in fact, is the substance of the poem.  The whole passage        from Ovid is of great anthropological interest:                 ‘. . . Cum Iunone iocos et maior vestra profecto est         Quam, quae contingit maribus,’ dixisse, ‘voluptas.’         Illa negat; placuit quae sit sententia docti         Quaerere Tiresiae: venus huic erat utraque nota.         Nam duo magnorum viridi coeuntia silva         Corpora serpentum baculi violaverat ictu         Deque viro factus, mirabile, femina septem         Egerat autumnos; octavo rursus eosdem         Vidit et ‘est vestrae si tanta potentia plagae,’         Dixit ‘ut auctoris sortem in contraria mutet,         Nunc quoque vos feriam!’ percussis anguibus isdem         Forma prior rediit genetivaque venit imago.         Arbiter hic igitur sumptus de lite iocosa         Dicta Iovis firmat; gravius Saturnia iusto         Nec pro materia fertur doluisse suique         Iudicis aeterna damnavit lumina nocte,         At pater omnipotens (neque enim licet inrita cuiquam         Facta dei fecisse deo) pro lumine adempto         Scire futura dedit poenamque levavit honore.              221.  This may not appear as exact as Sappho’s lines, but I had        in mind the “longshore” or “dory” fisherman, who returns at        nightfall.              253.  V. Goldsmith, the song in _The Vicar of Wakefield_.              257.  V.  _The Tempest_, as above.              264.  The interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of        the finest among Wren’s interiors.  See _The Proposed Demolition        of Nineteen City Churches_ (P. S. King &amp; Son, Ltd.).              266.  The Song of the (three) Thames-daughters begins here.        From line 292 to 306 inclusive they speak in turn.        V.  _Götterdämmerung_, III.  i:  the Rhine-daughters.              279.  V. Froude, _Elizabeth_, Vol.  I, ch.  iv, letter of De        Quadra to Philip of Spain:              “In the afternoon we were in a barge, watching the games on the        river. (The queen) was alone with Lord Robert and myself on the        poop, when they began to talk nonsense, and went so far that Lord        Robert at last said, as I was on the spot there was no reason why        they should not be married if the queen pleased.”              293.  Cf.  _Purgatorio_, v.  133:                 “Ricorditi di me, che son la Pia;         Siena mi fe’, disfecemi Maremma.”                    307.  V. St. Augustine’s _Confessions_:  “to Carthage then I        came, where a cauldron of unholy loves sang all about mine ears.”              308.  The complete text of the Buddha’s Fire Sermon (which        corresponds in importance to the Sermon on the Mount) from which        these words are taken, will be found translated in the late Henry        Clarke Warren’s _Buddhism in Translation_ (Harvard Oriental        Series). Mr. Warren was one of the great pioneers of Buddhist        studies in the Occident.              309.  From St. Augustine’s _Confessions_ again.  The collocation        of these two representatives of eastern and western asceticism,        as the culmination of this part of the poem, is not an accident.              V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID              In the first part of Part V three themes are employed:        the journey to Emmaus, the approach to the Chapel Perilous        (see Miss Weston’s book) and the present decay of eastern Europe.              357.  This is _Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii_, the hermit-thrush        which I have heard in Quebec County.  Chapman says (_Handbook of        Birds of Eastern North America_) “it is most at home in secluded        woodland and thickety retreats. . . . Its notes are not        remarkable for variety or volume, but in purity and sweetness of        tone and exquisite modulation they are unequalled.”  Its        “water-dripping song” is justly celebrated.              360.  The following lines were stimulated by the account of one        of the Antarctic expeditions (I forget which, but I think one        of Shackleton’s): it was related that the party of explorers,        at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion        that there was _one more member_ than could actually be counted.              366-76. Cf.  Hermann Hesse, _Blick ins Chaos_:              “Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten        Europas auf dem Wege zum Chaos, fährt betrunken im heiligem Wahn        am Abgrund entlang und singt dazu, singt betrunken und hymnisch        wie Dmitri Karamasoff sang. Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bürger        beleidigt, der Heilige und Seher hört sie mit Tränen.”              401.  “Datta, dayadhvam, damyata” (Give, sympathize,        control). The fable of the meaning of the Thunder is found        in the _Brihadaranyaka—Upanishad_, 5, 1.  A translation is found        in Deussen’s _Sechzig Upanishads des Veda_, p.  489.              407.  Cf.  Webster, _The White Devil_, v.  vi:                                                                “. . . they’ll remarry       Ere the worm pierce your winding-sheet, ere the spider       Make a thin curtain for your epitaphs.”            411.  Cf.  _Inferno_, xxxiii.  46:                      “ed io sentii chiavar l’uscio di sotto              all’orribile torre.”            Also F. H. Bradley, _Appearance and Reality_, p.  346:              “My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my        thoughts or my feelings.  In either case my experience falls        within my own circle, a circle closed on the outside; and, with        all its elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others        which surround it. . . . In brief, regarded as an existence which        appears in a soul, the whole world for each is peculiar and        private to that soul.”              424.  V. Weston, From _Ritual to Romance_; chapter on the Fisher        King.              427.  V.  _Purgatorio_, xxvi.  148.                      “‘Ara vos prec per aquella valor               ‘que vos guida al som de l’escalina,               ‘sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor.’                Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina.”            428.

16,Leaves of Grassr,"enthusiasts,    Be ye my Gods.      Or Time and Space,    Or shape of Earth divine and wondrous,    Or some fair shape I viewing, worship,    Or lustrous orb of sun or star by night,    Be ye my Gods.          Germs      Forms, qualities, lives, humanity, language, thoughts,    The ones known, and the ones unknown, the ones on the stars,    The stars themselves, some shaped, others unshaped,    Wonders as of those countries, the soil, trees, cities, inhabitants,        whatever they may be,    Splendid suns, the moons and rings, the countless combinations and effects,    Such-like, and as good as such-like, visible here or anywhere, stand        provided for a handful of space, which I extend my arm and        half enclose with my hand,    That containing the start of each and all, the virtue, the germs of all.          Thoughts      Of ownership--as if one fit to own things could not at pleasure enter        upon all, and incorporate them into himself or herself;    Of vista--suppose some sight in arriere through the formative chaos,        presuming the growth, fulness, life, now attain’d on the journey,    (But I see the road continued, and the journey ever continued;)    Of what was once lacking on earth, and in due time has become        supplied--and of what will yet be supplied,    Because all I see and know I believe to have its main purport in        what will yet be supplied.        When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer      When I heard the learn’d astronomer,    When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,    When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,    When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much        applause in the lecture-room,    How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,    Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,    In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,    Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.          Perfections      Only themselves understand themselves and the like of themselves,    As souls only understand souls.          O Me! O Life!      O me! O life! of the questions of these recurring,    Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,    Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I,        and who more faithless?)    Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the        struggle ever renew’d,    Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see        around me,    Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,    The question, O me! so sad, recurring--What good amid these, O me, O life?           Answer.    That you are here--that life exists and identity,    That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.          To a President      All you are doing and saying is to America dangled mirages,    You have not learn’d of Nature--of the politics of Nature you have        not learn’d the great amplitude, rectitude, impartiality,    You have not seen that only such as they are for these States,    And that what is less than they must sooner or later lift off from        these States.          I Sit and Look Out      I sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all        oppression and shame,    I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men at anguish with        themselves, remorseful after deeds done,    I see in low life the mother misused by her children, dying,        neglected, gaunt, desperate,    I see the wife misused by her husband, I see the treacherous seducer        of young women,    I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love attempted to be        hid, I see these sights on the earth,    I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny, I see martyrs and        prisoners,    I observe a famine at sea, I observe the sailors casting lots who        shall be kill’d to preserve the lives of the rest,    I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon        laborers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like;    All these--all the meanness and agony without end I sitting look out upon,    See, hear, and am silent.          To Rich Givers      What you give me I cheerfully accept,    A little sustenance, a hut and garden, a little money, as I        rendezvous with my poems,    A traveler’s lodging and breakfast as journey through the States,--        why should I be ashamed to own such gifts? why to advertise for them?    For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman,    For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of        the universe.          The Dalliance of the Eagles      Skirting the river road, (my forenoon walk, my rest,)    Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance of the eagles,    The rushing amorous contact high in space together,    The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, gyrating wheel,    Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass tight grappling,    In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight downward falling,    Till o’er the river pois’d, the twain yet one, a moment’s lull,    A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, talons loosing,    Upward again on slow-firm pinions slanting, their separate diverse flight,    She hers, he his, pursuing.          Roaming in Thought [After reading Hegel]      Roaming in thought over the Universe, I saw the little that is Good        steadily hastening towards immortality,    And the vast all that is call’d Evil I saw hastening to merge itself        and become lost and dead.          A Farm Picture      Through the ample open door of the peaceful country barn,    A sunlit pasture field with cattle and horses feeding,    And haze and vista, and the far horizon fading away.          A Child’s Amaze      Silent and amazed even when a little boy,    I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements,    As contending against some being or influence.          The Runner      On a flat road runs the well-train’d runner,    He is lean and sinewy with muscular legs,    He is thinly clothed, he leans forward as he runs,    With lightly closed fists and arms partially rais’d.          Beautiful Women      Women sit or move to and fro, some old, some young,    The young are beautiful--but the old are more beautiful than the young.          Mother and Babe      I see the sleeping babe nestling the breast of its mother,    The sleeping mother and babe--hush’d, I study them long and long.          Thought      Of obedience, faith, adhesiveness;    As I stand aloof and look there is to me something profoundly        affecting in large masses of men following the lead of those who        do not believe in men.          Visor’d      A mask, a perpetual natural disguiser of herself,    Concealing her face, concealing her form,    Changes and transformations every hour, every moment,    Falling upon her even when she sleeps.          Thought      Of justice--as If could be any thing but the same ample law,        expounded by natural judges and saviors,    As if it might be this thing or that thing, according to decisions.          Gliding O’er all      Gliding o’er all, through all,    Through Nature, Time, and Space,    As a ship on the waters advancing,    The voyage of the soul--not life alone,    Death, many deaths I’ll sing.          Hast Never Come to Thee an Hour      Hast never come to thee an hour,    A sudden gleam divine, precipitating, bursting all these bubbles,        fashions, wealth?    These eager business aims--books, politics, art, amours,    To utter nothingness?          Thought      Of Equality--as if it harm’d me, giving others the same chances and        rights as myself--as if it were not indispensable to my own        rights that others possess the same.          To Old Age      I see in you the estuary that enlarges and spreads itself grandly as        it pours in the great sea.          Locations and Times      Locations and times--what is it in me that meets them all, whenever        and wherever, and makes me at home?    Forms, colors, densities, odors--what is it in me that corresponds        with them?          Offerings      A thousand perfect men and women appear,    Around each gathers a cluster of friends, and gay children and        youths, with offerings.          To The States [To Identify the 16th, 17th, or 18th Presidentiad]      Why reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing?    What deepening twilight-scum floating atop of the waters,    Who are they as bats and night-dogs askant in the capitol?    What a filthy Presidentiad! (O South, your torrid suns! O North,        your arctic freezings!)    Are those really Congressmen? are those the great Judges? is that        the President?    Then I will sleep awhile yet, for I see that these States sleep, for        reasons;    (With gathering murk, with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we        all duly awake,    South, North, East, West, inland and seaboard, we will surely awake.)          BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS      First O Songs for a Prelude      First O songs for a prelude,    Lightly strike on the stretch’d tympanum pride and joy in my city,    How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,    How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,    (O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!    O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!)    How you sprang--how you threw off the costumes of peace with        indifferent hand,    How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard        in their stead,    How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of        soldiers,)    How Manhattan drum-taps led.      Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,    Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this teeming and        turbulent city,    Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,    With her million children around her, suddenly,    At dead of night, at news from the south,    Incens’d struck with clinch’d hand the pavement.      A shock electric, the night sustain’d it,    Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour’d out its myriads.      From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,    Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.      To the drum-taps prompt,    The young men falling in and arming,    The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith’s        hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)    The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the court,    The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing        the reins abruptly down on the horses’ backs,    The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all leaving;    Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,    The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their        accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,    Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musket-barrels,    The white tents cluster in camps, the arm’d sentries around, the        sunrise cannon and again at sunset,    Arm’d regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark        from the wharves,    (How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with        their guns on their shoulders!    How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and        their clothes and knapsacks cover’d with dust!)    The blood of the city up-arm’d! arm’d! the cry everywhere,    The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the        public buildings and stores,    The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his mother,    (Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain him,)    The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the way,    The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their favorites,    The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along,        rumble lightly over the stones,    (Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,    Soon unlimber’d to begin the red business;)    All the mutter of preparation, all the determin’d arming,    The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,    The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no        mere parade now;    War! an arm’d race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no turning away!    War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm’d race is advancing to        welcome it.      Mannahatta a-march--and it’s O to sing it well!    It’s O for a manly life in the camp.      And the sturdy artillery,    The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,    Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salutes for        courtesies merely,    Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)      And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,    Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,    Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown’d amid        all your children,    But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.          Eighteen Sixty-One      Arm’d year--year of the struggle,    No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year,    Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas piano,    But as a strong man erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing,        carrying rifle on your shoulder,    With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with a knife in        the belt at your side,    As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing across the        continent,    Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,    Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen, the        dwellers in Manhattan,    Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana,    Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Allghanies,    Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along        the Ohio river,    Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at        Chattanooga on the mountain top,    Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue, bearing        weapons, robust year,    Heard your determin’d voice launch’d forth again and again,    Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp’d cannon,    I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.          Beat! Beat! Drums!      Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!    Through the windows--through doors--burst like a ruthless force,    Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,    Into the school where the scholar is studying;    Leave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with        his bride,    Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering        his grain,    So fierce you whirr and pound you drums--so shrill you bugles blow.      Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!    Over the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the streets;    Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers        must sleep in those beds,    No bargainers’ bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--would        they continue?    Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?    Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?    Then rattle quicker, heavier drums--you bugles wilder blow.      Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!    Make no parley--stop for no expostulation,    Mind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer,    Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,    Let not the child’s voice be heard, nor the mother’s entreaties,    Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the        hearses,    So strong you thump O terrible drums--so loud you bugles blow.          From Paumanok Starting I Fly Like a Bird      From Paumanok starting I fly like a bird,    Around and around to soar to sing the idea of all,    To the north betaking myself to sing there arctic songs,    To Kanada till I absorb Kanada in myself, to Michigan then,    To Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, to sing their songs, (they are inimitable;)    Then to Ohio and Indiana to sing theirs, to Missouri and Kansas and        Arkansas to sing theirs,    To Tennessee and Kentucky, to the Carolinas and Georgia to sing theirs,    To Texas and so along up toward California, to roam accepted everywhere;    To sing first, (to the tap of the war-drum if need be,)    The idea of all, of the Western world one and inseparable,    And then the song of each member of these States.          Song of the Banner at Daybreak           Poet:    O A new song, a free song,    Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,    By the wind’s voice and that of the drum,    By the banner’s voice and child’s voice and sea’s voice and father’s voice,    Low on the ground and high in the air,    On the ground where father and child stand,    In the upward air where their eyes turn,    Where the banner at daybreak is flapping.      Words! book-words! what are you?    Words no more, for hearken and see,    My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,    With the banner and pennant a-flapping.      I’ll weave the chord and twine in,    Man’s desire and babe’s desire, I’ll twine them in, I’ll put in life,    I’ll put the bayonet’s flashing point, I’ll let bullets and slugs whizz,    (As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the future,    Crying with trumpet voice, Arouse and beware! Beware and arouse!)    I’ll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of joy,    Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,    With the banner and pennant a-flapping.           Pennant:    Come up here, bard, bard,    Come up here, soul, soul,    Come up here, dear little child,    To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measureless light.           Child:    Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?    And what does it say to me all the while?           Father:    Nothing my babe you see in the sky,    And nothing at all to you it says--but look you my babe,    Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the money-        shops opening,    And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with goods;    These, ah these, how valued and toil’d for these!    How envied by all the earth.           Poet:    Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high,    On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels,    On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward land,    The great steady wind from west or west-by-south,    Floating so buoyant with milk-white foam on the waters.      But I am not the sea nor the red sun,    I am not the wind with girlish laughter,    Not the immense wind which strengthens, not the wind which lashes,    Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death,    But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,    Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,    Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings,    And the shore-sands know and the hissing wave, and that banner and pennant,    Aloft there flapping and flapping.           Child:    O father it is alive--it is full of people--it has children,    O now it seems to me it is talking to its children,    I hear it--it talks to me--O it is wonderful!    O it stretches--it spreads and runs so fast--O my father,    It is so broad it covers the whole sky.           Father:    Cease, cease, my foolish babe,    What you are saying is sorrowful to me, much ’t displeases me;    Behold with the rest again I say, behold not banners and pennants aloft,    But the well-prepared pavements behold, and mark the solid-wall’d houses.           Banner and Pennant:    Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan,    To our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,    Point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all--and yet we know        not why,    For what are we, mere strips of cloth profiting nothing,    Only flapping in the wind?            Poet:    I hear and see not strips of cloth alone,    I hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry,    I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men, I hear Liberty!    I hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing,    I myself move abroad swift-rising flying then,    I use the wings of the land-bird and use the wings of the sea-bird,        and look down as from a height,    I do not deny the precious results of peace, I see populous cities        with wealth incalculable,    I see numberless farms, I see the farmers working in their fields or barns,    I see mechanics working, I see buildings everywhere founded, going        up, or finish’d,    I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn by        the locomotives,    I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans,    I see far in the West the immense area of grain, I dwell awhile hovering,    I pass to the lumber forests of the North, and again to the Southern        plantation, and again to California;    Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings,        earn’d wages,    See the Identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and haughty        States, (and many more to come,)    See forts on the shores of harbors, see ships sailing in and out;    Then over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen’d pennant shaped        like a sword,    Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance--and now the halyards        have rais’d it,    Side of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry banner,    Discarding peace over all the sea and land.           Banner and Pennant:    Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!    No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone,    We may be terror and carnage, and are so now,    Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States, (nor        any five, nor ten,)    Nor market nor depot we, nor money-bank in the city,    But these and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines        below, are ours,    And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small,    And the fields they moisten, and the crops and the fruits are ours,    Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours--while we over all,    Over the area spread below, the three or four millions of square        miles, the capitals,    The forty millions of people,--O bard! in life and death supreme,    We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,    Not for the present alone, for a thousand years chanting through you,    This song to the soul of one poor little child.           Child:    O my father I like not the houses,    They will never to me be any thing, nor do I like money,    But to mount up there I would like, O father dear, that banner I like,    That pennant I would be and must be.           Father:    Child of mine you fill me with anguish,    To be that pennant would be too fearful,    Little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever,    It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy every thing,    Forward to stand in front of wars--and O, such wars!--what have you        to do with them?    With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?           Banner:    Demons and death then I sing,    Put in all, aye all will I, sword-shaped pennant for war,    And a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of children,    Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash of the sea,    And the black ships fighting on the sea envelop’d in smoke,    And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and pines,    And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching, and the        hot sun shining south,    And the beach-waves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore,        and my Western shore the same,    And all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi with        bends and chutes,    And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of Missouri,    The Continent, devoting the whole identity without reserving an atom,    Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all and the yield of all,    Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole,    No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,    But out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no more,    Croaking like crows here in the wind.           Poet:    My limbs, my veins dilate, my theme is clear at last,    Banner so broad advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty and resolute,    I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen’d and blinded,    My hearing and tongue are come to me, (a little child taught me,)    I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand,    Insensate! insensate! (yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!    Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their        prosperity, (if need be, you shall again have every one of those        houses to destroy them,    You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast,        full of comfort, built with money,    May they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above them and all        stand fast;)    O banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, nor        the material good nutriment,    Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships,    Not the superb ships with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and        carrying cargoes,    Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues--but you as henceforth        I see you,    Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars,        (ever-enlarging stars,)    Divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touch’d by the sun,        measuring the sky,    (Passionately seen and yearn’d for by one poor little child,    While others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching        thrift, thrift;)    O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake hissing        so curious,    Out of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking bloody        death, loved by me,    So loved--O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the night!    Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all--(absolute        owner of all)--O banner and pennant!    I too leave the rest--great as it is, it is nothing--houses, machines        are nothing--I see them not,    I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes,        sing you only,    Flapping up there in the wind.          Rise O Days from Your Fathomless Deeps           1    Rise O days from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier, fiercer sweep,    Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour’d what the earth gave me,    Long I roam’d amid the woods of the north, long I watch’d Niagara pouring,    I travel’d the prairies over and slept on their breast, I cross’d        the Nevadas, I cross’d the plateaus,    I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail’d out to sea,    I sail’d through the storm, I was refresh’d by the storm,    I watch’d with joy the threatening maws of the waves,      I mark’d the white combs where they career’d so high, curling over,    I heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds,    Saw from below what arose and mounted, (O superb! O wild as my        heart, and powerful!)    Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow’d after the lightning,    Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and        fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky;    These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet pensive        and masterful,    All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,    Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.           2    ’Twas well, O soul--’twas a good preparation you gave me,    Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,    Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us,    Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities,    Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,    Torrents of men, (sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed        inexhaustible?)    What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those storms of        the mountains and sea?    What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea risen?    Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?    Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage,    Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati, Chicago,        unchain’d;    What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,    How it climbs with daring feet and hands--how it dashes!    How the true thunder bellows after the lightning--how bright the        flashes of lightning!    How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown        through the dark by those flashes of lightning!    (Yet a mournful wall and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,    In a lull of the deafening confusion.)           3    Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!    And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!    Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms! you have done me good,    My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong nutriment,    Long had I walk’d my cities, my country roads through farms, only        half satisfied,    One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake, crawl’d on the ground before me,    Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing low;    The cities I loved so well I abandon’d and left, I sped to the        certainties suitable to me,    Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and Nature’s        dauntlessness,    I refresh’d myself with it only, I could relish it only,    I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire--on the water and air        waited long;    But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,    I have witness’d the true lightning, I have witness’d my cities electric,    I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise,    Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,    No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea.          Virginia--The West      The noble sire fallen on evil days,    I saw with hand uplifted, menacing, brandishing,    (Memories of old in abeyance, love and faith in abeyance,)    The insane knife toward the Mother of All.      The noble son on sinewy feet advancing,    I saw, out of the land of prairies, land of Ohio’s waters and of Indiana,    To the rescue the stalwart giant hurry his plenteous offspring,    Drest in blue, bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders.      Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking,    As to you Rebellious, (I seemed to hear her say,) why strive against        me, and why seek my life?    When you yourself forever provide to defend me?    For you provided me Washington--and now these also.          City of Ships      City of ships!    (O the black ships! O the fierce ships!    O the beautiful sharp-bow’d steam-ships and sail-ships!)    City of the world! (for all races are here,    All the lands of the earth make contributions here;)    City of the sea! city of hurried and glittering tides!    City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in and        out with eddies and foam!    City of wharves and stores--city of tall facades of marble and iron!    Proud and passionate city--mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!    Spring up O city--not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself, warlike!    Fear not--submit to no models but your own O city!    Behold me--incarnate me as I have incarnated you!    I have rejected nothing you offer’d me--whom you adopted I have adopted,    Good or bad I never question you--I love all--I do not condemn any thing,    I chant and celebrate all that is yours--yet peace no more,    In peace I chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine,    War, red war is my song through your streets, O city!          The Centenarian’s Story           [Volunteer of 1861-2, at Washington Park, Brooklyn, assisting         the Centenarian.]    Give me your hand old Revolutionary,    The hill-top is nigh, but a few steps, (make room gentlemen,)    Up the path you have follow’d me well, spite of your hundred and        extra years,    You can walk old man, though your eyes are almost done,    Your faculties serve you, and presently I must have them serve me.      Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means,    On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,    There is the camp, one regiment departs to-morrow,    Do you hear the officers giving their orders?    Do you hear the clank of the muskets?    Why what comes over you now old man?    Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?    The troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles,    Around them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,    While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,    Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze,    O’er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.      But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,    Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!      As wending the crowds now part and disperse--but we old man,    Not for nothing have I brought you hither--we must remain,    You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.           [The Centenarian]    When I clutch’d your hand it was not with terror,    But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,    And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they ran,    And where tents are pitch’d, and wherever you see south and south-        east and south-west,    Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,    And along the shores, in mire (now fill’d over) came again and        suddenly raged,    As eighty-five years agone no mere parade receiv’d with applause of friends,    But a battle which I took part in myself--aye, long ago as it is, I        took part in it,    Walking then this hilltop, this same ground.      Aye, this is the ground,    My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,    The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,    Rude forts appear again, the old hoop’d guns are mounted,    I see the lines of rais’d earth stretching from river to bay,    I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;    Here we lay encamp’d, it was this time in summer also.      As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,    It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,    By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up        his unsheath’d sword,    It glitter’d in the sun in full sight of the army.      ’Twas a bold act then--the English war-ships had just arrived,    We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,    And the transports swarming with soldiers.      A few days more and they landed, and then the battle.      Twenty thousand were brought against us,    A veteran force furnish’d with good artillery.      I tell not now the whole of the battle,    But one brigade early in the forenoon order’d forward to engage the        red-coats,    Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march’d,    And how long and well it stood confronting death.      Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?    It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,    Rais’d in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally        to the General.      Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus’ waters,    Till of a sudden unlook’d for by defiles through the woods, gain’d at night,    The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing        their guns,    That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy’s mercy.      The General watch’d them from this hill,    They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,    Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,    But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!      It sickens me yet, that slaughter!    I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.    I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.      Meanwhile the British manœuvr’d to draw us out for a pitch’d battle,    But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch’d battle.      We fought the fight in detachments,    Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was        against us,    Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push’d us back        to the works on this hill,    Till we turn’d menacing here, and then he left us.      That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand        strong,    Few return’d, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.      That and here my General’s first battle,    No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude        with applause,    Nobody clapp’d hands here then.      But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,    Wearied that night we lay foil’d and sullen,    While scornfully laugh’d many an arrogant lord off against us encamp’d,    Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over        their victory.      So dull and damp and another day,    But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,    Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my        General retreated.      I saw him at the river-side,    Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;    My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass’d over,    And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for        the last time.      Every one else seem’d fill’d with gloom,    Many no doubt thought of capitulation.      But when my General pass’d me,    As he stood in his boat and look’d toward the coming sun,    I saw something different from capitulation.           [Terminus]    Enough, the Centenarian’s story ends,    The two, the past and present, have interchanged,    I myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now speaking.      And is this the ground Washington trod?    And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he cross’d,    As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?      I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,    I must preserve that look as it beam’d on you rivers of Brooklyn.      See--as the annual round returns the phantoms return,    It is the 27th of August and the British have landed,    The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke        Washington’s face,    The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march’d forth to intercept        the enemy,    They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,    Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,    Baptized that day in many a young man’s bloody wounds.    In death, defeat, and sisters’, mothers’ tears.      Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable        than your owners supposed;    In the midst of you stands an encampment very old,    Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade.          Cavalry Crossing a Ford      A line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands,    They take a serpentine course, their arms flash in the sun--hark to        the musical clank,    Behold the silvery river, in it the splashing horses loitering stop        to drink,    Behold the brown-faced men, each group, each person a picture, the        negligent rest on the saddles,    Some emerge on the opposite bank, others are just entering the ford--while,    Scarlet and blue and snowy white,    The guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind.          Bivouac on a Mountain Side      I see before me now a traveling army halting,    Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,    Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising high,    Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily seen,    The numerous camp-fires scatter’d near and far, some away up on the        mountain,    The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering,    And over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,        breaking out, the eternal stars.          An Army Corps on the March      With its cloud of skirmishers in advance,    With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an        irregular volley,    The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on,    Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun--the dust-cover’d men,    In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,    With artillery interspers’d--the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,    As the army corps advances.          By the Bivouac’s Fitful Flame      By the bivouac’s fitful flame,    A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow--but        first I note,    The tents of the sleeping army, the fields’ and woods’ dim outline,    The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire, the silence,    Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving,    The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily        watching me,)    While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,    Of life and death, of home and the past and loved, and of those that        are far away;    A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,    By the bivouac’s fitful flame.          Come Up from the Fields Father      Come up from the fields father, here’s a letter from our Pete,    And come to the front door mother, here’s a letter from thy dear son.      Lo, ’tis autumn,    Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,    Cool and sweeten Ohio’s villages with leaves fluttering in the        moderate wind,    Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis’d vines,    (Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?    Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)      Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and        with wondrous clouds,    Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well.      Down in the fields all prospers well,    But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter’s call.    And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.      Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,    She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.      Open the envelope quickly,    O this is not our son’s writing, yet his name is sign’d,    O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother’s soul!    All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main        words only,    Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,        taken to hospital,    At present low, but will soon be better.      Ah now the single figure to me,    Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,    Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,    By the jamb of a door leans.      Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through        her sobs,    The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay’d,)    See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better.      Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be        better, that brave and simple soul,)    While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,    The only son is dead.      But the mother needs to be better,    She with thin form presently drest in black,    By day her meals untouch’d, then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,    In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,    O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and withdraw,    To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.          Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night      Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;    When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,    One look I but gave which your dear eyes return’d with a look I        shall never forget,    One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach’d up as you lay on the ground,    Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,    Till late in the night reliev’d to the place at last again I made my way,    Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of        responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)    Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the        moderate night-wind,    Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the        battlefield spreading,    Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,    But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,    Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my        chin in my hands,    Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest        comrade--not a tear, not a word,    Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,    As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,    Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,    I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall        surely meet again,)    Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear’d,    My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop’d well his form,    Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and        carefully under feet,    And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his        grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,    Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim,    Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)    Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day        brighten’d,    I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,    And buried him where he fell.          A March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown      A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,    A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,    Our army foil’d with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,    Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,    We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted building,    ’Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospital,    Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and        poems ever made,    Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,    And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and        clouds of smoke,    By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some        in the pews laid down,    At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of        bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)    I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster’s face is white as a lily,)    Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o’er the scene fain to absorb it all,    Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,        some of them dead,    Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,        odor of blood,    The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill’d,    Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the        death-spasm sweating,    An occasional scream or cry, the doctor’s shouted orders or calls,    The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of        the torches,    These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,    Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;    But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,    Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,    Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,    The unknown road still marching.          A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim      A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,    As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,    As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent,    Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended lying,    Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woolen blanket,    Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.      Curious I halt and silent stand,    Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first        just lift the blanket;    Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray’d hair,        and flesh all sunken about the eyes?    Who are you my dear comrade?    Then to the second I step--and who are you my child and darling?    Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?    Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of        beautiful yellow-white ivory;    Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the        Christ himself,    Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.          As Toilsome I Wander’d Virginia’s Woods      As toilsome I wander’d Virginia’s woods,    To the music of rustling leaves kick’d by my feet, (for ’twas autumn,)    I mark’d at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;    Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all could        understand,)    The halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to lose--yet this sign left,    On a tablet scrawl’d and nail’d on the tree by the grave,    Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.      Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering,    Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life,    Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone, or        in the crowded street,    Comes before me the unknown soldier’s grave, comes the inscription        rude in Virginia’s woods,    Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.          Not the Pilot      Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port,        though beaten back and many times baffled;    Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long,    By deserts parch’d, snows chill’d, rivers wet, perseveres till he        reaches his destination,    More than I have charged myself, heeded or unheeded, to compose        march for these States,    For a battle-call, rousing to arms if need be, years, centuries hence.          Year That Trembled and Reel’d Beneath Me      Year that trembled and reel’d beneath me!    Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me,    A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken’d me,    Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,    Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?    And sullen hymns of defeat?          The Wound-Dresser           1    An old man bending I come among new faces,    Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,    Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,    (Arous’d and angry, I’d thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war,    But soon my fingers fail’d me, my face droop’d and I resign’d myself,    To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)    Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,    Of unsurpass’d heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)    Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,    Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?    What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,    Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?           2    O maidens and young men I love and that love me,    What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls,    Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover’d with sweat and dust,    In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the        rush of successful charge,    Enter the captur’d works--yet lo, like a swift-running river they fade,    Pass and are gone they fade--I dwell not on soldiers’ perils or        soldiers’ joys,    (Both I remember well--many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.)      But in silence, in dreams’ projections,    While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,    So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,    With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up there,    Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)      Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,    Straight and swift to my wounded I go,    Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,    Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,    Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof’d hospital,    To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,    To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,    An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,    Soon to be fill’d with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill’d again.      I onward go, I stop,    With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,    I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,    One turns to me his appealing eyes--poor boy! I never knew you,    Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that        would save you.           3    On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)    The crush’d head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away,)    The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through examine,    Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life        struggles hard,    (Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!    In mercy come quickly.)      From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,    I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood,    Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv’d neck and side falling head,    His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the        bloody stump,    And has not yet look’d on it.      I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,    But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,    And the yellow-blue countenance see.      I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,    Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening,        so offensive,    While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.      I am faithful, I do not give out,    The fractur’d thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,    These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast        a fire, a burning flame.)           4    Thus in silence in dreams’ projections,    Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,    The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,    I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,    Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,    (Many a soldier’s loving arms about this neck have cross’d and rested,    Many a soldier’s kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)          Long, Too Long America      Long, too long America,    Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn’d from joys and        prosperity only,    But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish, advancing,        grappling with direst fate and recoiling not,    And now to conceive and show to the world what your children        en-masse really are,    (For who except myself has yet conceiv’d what your children en-masse        really are?)          Give Me the Splendid Silent Sun           1    Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full-dazzling,    Give me autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard,    Give me a field where the unmow’d grass grows,    Give me an arbor, give me the trellis’d grape,    Give me fresh corn and wheat, give me serene-moving animals teaching        content,    Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the        Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars,    Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can        walk undisturb’d,    Give me for marriage a sweet-breath’d woman of whom I should never tire,    Give me a perfect child, give me away aside from the noise of the        world a rural domestic life,    Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself, for my own ears only,    Give me solitude, give me Nature, give me again O Nature your primal        sanities!      These demanding to have them, (tired with ceaseless excitement, and        rack’d by the war-strife,)    These to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,    While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city,    Day upon day and year upon year O city, walking your streets,    Where you hold me enchain’d a certain time refusing to give me up,    Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich’d of soul, you give me forever faces;    (O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries,    see my own soul trampling down what it ask’d for.)           2    Keep your splendid silent sun,    Keep your woods O Nature, and the quiet places by the woods,    Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your corn-fields and orchards,    Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninth-month bees hum;    Give me faces and streets--give me these phantoms incessant and        endless along the trottoirs!    Give me interminable eyes--give me women--give me comrades and        lovers by the thousand!    Let me see new ones every day--let me hold new ones by the hand every day!    Give me such shows--give me the streets of Manhattan!    Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching--give me the sound of        the trumpets and drums!    (The soldiers in companies or regiments--some starting away, flush’d        and reckless,    Some, their time up, returning with thinn’d ranks, young, yet very        old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;)    Give me the shores and wharves heavy-fringed with black ships!    O such for me! O an intense life, full to repletion and varied!    The life of the theatre, bar-room, huge hotel, for me!    The saloon of the steamer! the crowded excursion for me! the        torchlight procession!    The dense brigade bound for the war, with high piled military wagons        following;    People, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants,    Manhattan streets with their powerful throbs, with beating drums as now,    The endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, (even        the sight of the wounded,)    Manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical chorus!    Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me.          Dirge for Two Veterans           The last sunbeam    Lightly falls from the finish’d Sabbath,    On the pavement here, and there beyond it is looking,         Down a new-made double grave.           Lo, the moon ascending,    Up from the east the silvery round moon,    Beautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon,         Immense and silent moon.           I see a sad procession,    And I hear the sound of coming full-key’d bugles,    All the channels of the city streets they’re flooding,         As with voices and with tears.           I hear the great drums pounding,    And the small drums steady whirring,    And every blow of the great convulsive drums,         Strikes me through and through.           For the son is brought with the father,    (In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,    Two veterans son and father dropt together,         And the double grave awaits them.)           Now nearer blow the bugles,    And the drums strike more convulsive,    And the daylight o’er the pavement quite has faded,         And the strong dead-march enwraps me.           In the eastern sky up-buoying,    The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin’d,    (’Tis some mother’s large transparent face,         In heaven brighter growing.)           O strong dead-march you please me!    O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!    O my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!         What I have I also give you.           The moon gives you light,    And the bugles and the drums give you music,    And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,         My heart gives you love.          Over the Carnage Rose Prophetic a Voice      Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice,    Be not dishearten’d, affection shall solve the problems of freedom yet,    Those who love each other shall become invincible,    They shall yet make Columbia victorious.      Sons of the Mother of All, you shall yet be victorious,    You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the earth.      No danger shall balk Columbia’s lovers,    If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.      One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian’s comrade,    From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another an Oregonese, shall        be friends triune,    More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.      To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come,    Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death.      It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly affection,    The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly,    The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,    The continuance of Equality shall be comrades.      These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron,    I, ecstatic, O partners! O lands! with the love of lovers tie you.      (Were you looking to be held together by lawyers?    Or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms?    Nay, nor the world, nor any living thing, will so cohere.)          I Saw Old General at Bay      I saw old General at bay,    (Old as he was, his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars,)    His small force was now completely hemm’d in, in his works,    He call’d for volunteers to run the enemy’s lines, a desperate emergency,    I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks, but two or three        were selected,    I saw them receive their orders aside, they listen’d with care, the        adjutant was very grave,    I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives.          The Artilleryman’s Vision      While my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long,    And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant midnight passes,    And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the        breath of my infant,    There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me;    The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,    The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the        irregular snap! snap!    I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short t-h-t! t-h-t!        of the rifle-balls,    I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear the        great shells shrieking as they pass,    The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees,        (tumultuous now the contest rages,)    All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again,    The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their pieces,    The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of        the right time,    After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the effect;    Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young colonel        leads himself this time with brandish’d sword,)    I see the gaps cut by the enemy’s volleys, (quickly fill’d up, no delay,)    I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover low        concealing all;    Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either side,    Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls and        orders of officers,    While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears        a shout of applause, (some special success,)    And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even in        dreams a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the        depths of my soul,)    And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions, batteries,        cavalry, moving hither and thither,    (The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and red        heed not, some to the rear are hobbling,)    Grime, heat, rush, aide-de-camps galloping by or on a full run,    With the patter of small arms, the warning s-s-t of the rifles,        (these in my vision I hear or see,)    And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color’d rockets.          Ethiopia Saluting the Colors      Who are you dusky woman, so ancient hardly human,    With your woolly-white and turban’d head, and bare bony feet?    Why rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?      (’Tis while our army lines Carolina’s sands and pines,    Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com’st to me,    As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.)      Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunder’d,    A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught,    Then hither me across the sea the cruel slaver brought.      No further does she say, but lingering all the day,    Her high-borne turban’d head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,    And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by.      What is it fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?    Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red and green?    Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or have seen?          Not Youth Pertains to Me      Not youth pertains to me,    Nor delicatesse, I cannot beguile the time with talk,    Awkward in the parlor, neither a dancer nor elegant,    In the learn’d coterie sitting constrain’d and still, for learning        inures not to me,    Beauty, knowledge, inure not to me--yet there are two or three things        inure to me,    I have nourish’d the wounded and sooth’d many a dying soldier,    And at intervals waiting or in the midst of camp,    Composed these songs.          Race of Veterans      Race of veterans--race of victors!    Race of the soil, ready for conflict--race of the conquering march!    (No more credulity’s race, abiding-temper’d race,)    Race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself,    Race of passion and the storm.          World Take Good Notice      World take good notice, silver stars fading,    Milky hue ript, wet of white detaching,    Coals thirty-eight, baleful and burning,    Scarlet, significant, hands off warning,    Now and henceforth flaunt from these shores.          O Tan-Faced Prairie-Boy      O tan-faced prairie-boy,    Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift,    Praises and presents came and nourishing food, till at last among        the recruits,    You came, taciturn, with nothing to give--we but look’d on each other,    When lo! more than all the gifts of the world you gave me.          Look Down Fair Moon      Look down fair moon and bathe this scene,    Pour softly down night’s nimbus floods on faces ghastly, swollen, purple,    On the dead on their backs with arms toss’d wide,    Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon.          Reconciliation      Word over all, beautiful as the sky,    Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be        utterly lost,    That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly        wash again, and ever again, this solid world;    For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,    I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin--I draw near,    Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin.          How Solemn As One by One [Washington City, 1865]      How solemn as one by one,    As the ranks returning worn and sweaty, as the men file by where stand,    As the faces the masks appear, as I glance at the faces studying the masks,    (As I glance upward out of this page studying you, dear friend,        whoever you are,)    How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks,        and to you,    I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul,    O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,    Nor the bayonet stab what you really are;    The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,    Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,    Nor the bayonet stab O friend.          As I Lay with My Head in Your Lap Camerado      As I lay with my head in your lap camerado,    The confession I made I resume, what I said to you and the open air        I resume,    I know I am restless and make others so,    I know my words are weapons full of danger, full of death,    For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to        unsettle them,    I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have        been had all accepted me,    I heed not and have never heeded either experience, cautions,        majorities, nor ridicule,    And the threat of what is call’d hell is little or nothing to me,    And the lure of what is call’d heaven is little or nothing to me;    Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still        urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,    Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell’d and defeated.          Delicate Cluster      Delicate cluster! flag of teeming life!    Covering all my lands--all my seashores lining!    Flag of death! (how I watch’d you through the smoke of battle pressing!    How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)    Flag cerulean--sunny flag, with the orbs of night dappled!    Ah my silvery beauty--ah my woolly white and crimson!    Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!    My sacred one, my mother.          To a Certain Civilian      Did you ask dulcet rhymes from me?    Did you seek the civilian’s peaceful and languishing rhymes?    Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?    Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand--nor        am I now;    (I have been born of the same as the war was born,    The drum-corps’ rattle is ever to me sweet music, I love well the        martial dirge,    With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officer’s funeral;)    What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I? therefore leave my works,    And go lull yourself with what you can understand, and with piano-tunes,    For I lull nobody, and you will never understand me.          Lo, Victress on the Peaks      Lo, Victress on the peaks,    Where thou with mighty brow regarding the world,    (The world O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee,)    Out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all,    Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,    Flauntest now unharm’d in immortal soundness and bloom--lo, in        these hours supreme,    No poem proud, I chanting bring to thee, nor mastery’s rapturous verse,    But a cluster containing night’s darkness and blood-dripping wounds,    And psalms of the dead.          Spirit Whose Work Is Done [Washington City, 1865]      Spirit whose work is done--spirit of dreadful hours!    Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;    Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever unfaltering        pressing,)    Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene--electric spirit,    That with muttering voice through the war now closed, like a        tireless phantom flitted,    Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the drum,    Now as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,        reverberates round me,    As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles,    As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders,    As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders,    As those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them appearing in the        distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,    Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro to the right and left,    Evenly lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time;    Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death next day,    Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close,    Leave me your pulses of rage--bequeath them to me--fill me with        currents convulsive,    Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone,    Let them identify you to the future in these songs.          Adieu to a Soldier      Adieu O soldier,    You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)    The rapid march, the life of the camp,    The hot contention of opposing fronts, the long manœuvre,    Red battles with their slaughter, the stimulus, the strong terrific game,    Spell of all brave and manly hearts, the trains of time through you        and like of you all fill’d,    With war and war’s expression.      Adieu dear comrade,    Your mission is fulfill’d--but I, more warlike,    Myself and this contentious soul of mine,    Still on our own campaigning bound,    Through untried roads with ambushes opponents lined,    Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis, often baffled,    Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out--aye here,    To fiercer, weightier battles give expression.          Turn O Libertad      Turn O Libertad, for the war is over,    From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no more, resolute,        sweeping the world,    Turn from lands retrospective recording proofs of the past,    From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past,    From the chants of the feudal world, the triumphs of kings, slavery, caste,    Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv’d and to come--give up that        backward world,    Leave to the singers of hitherto, give them the trailing past,    But what remains remains for singers for you--wars to come are for you,    (Lo, how the wars of the past have duly inured to you, and the wars        of the present also inure;)    Then turn, and be not alarm’d O Libertad--turn your undying face,    To where the future, greater than all the past,    Is swiftly, surely preparing for you.          To the Leaven’d Soil They Trod      To the leaven’d soil they trod calling I sing for the last,    (Forth from my tent emerging for good, loosing, untying the tent-ropes,)    In the freshness the forenoon air, in the far-stretching circuits        and vistas again to peace restored,    To the fiery fields emanative and the endless vistas beyond, to the        South and the North,    To the leaven’d soil of the general Western world to attest my songs,    To the Alleghanian hills and the tireless Mississippi,    To the rocks I calling sing, and all the trees in the woods,    To the plains of the poems of heroes, to the prairies spreading wide,    To the far-off sea and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable air;    And responding they answer all, (but not in words,)    The average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges mutely,    The prairie draws me close, as the father to bosom broad the son,    The Northern ice and rain that began me nourish me to the end,    But the hot sun of the South is to fully ripen my songs.          BOOK XXII.  MEMORIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN      When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d           1    When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom’d,    And the great star early droop’d in the western sky in the night,    I mourn’d, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.      Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,    Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,    And thought of him I love.           2    O powerful western fallen star!    O shades of night--O moody, tearful night!    O great star disappear’d--O the black murk that hides the star!    O cruel hands that hold me powerless--O helpless soul of me!    O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.            3    In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash’d palings,    Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green,    With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love,    With every leaf a miracle--and from this bush in the dooryard,    With delicate-color’d blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,    A sprig with its flower I break.           4    In the swamp in secluded recesses,    A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.      Solitary the thrush,    The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,    Sings by himself a song.      Song of the bleeding throat,    Death’s outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know,    If thou wast not granted to sing thou wouldst surely die.)           5    Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,    Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep’d        from the ground, spotting the gray debris,    Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the        endless grass,    Passing the yellow-spear’d wheat, every grain from its shroud in the        dark-brown fields uprisen,    Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,    Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,    Night and day journeys a coffin.           6    Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,    Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land,    With the pomp of the inloop’d flags with the cities draped in black,    With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil’d women standing,    With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,    With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the        unbared heads,    With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,    With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong        and solemn,    With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour’d around the coffin,    The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs--where amid these        you journey,    With the tolling tolling bells’ perpetual clang,    Here, coffin that slowly passes,    I give you my sprig of lilac.           7    (Nor for you, for one alone,    Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring,    For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane        and sacred death.      All over bouquets of roses,    O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,    But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,    Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,    With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,    For you and the coffins all of you O death.)           8    O western orb sailing the heaven,    Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk’d,    As I walk’d in silence the transparent shadowy night,    As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,    As you droop’d from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the        other stars all look’d on,)    As we wander’d together the solemn night, (for something I know not        what kept me from sleep,)    As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you        were of woe,    As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night,    As I watch’d where you pass’d and was lost in the netherward black        of the night,    As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,    Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.           9    Sing on there in the swamp,    O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call,    I hear, I come presently, I understand you,    But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain’d me,    The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.           10    O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?    And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?    And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?      Sea-winds blown from east and west,    Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till        there on the prairies meeting,    These and with these and the breath of my chant,    I’ll perfume the grave of him I love.           11    O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?    And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,    To adorn the burial-house of him I love?    Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,    With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,    With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking        sun, burning, expanding the air,    With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves        of the trees prolific,    In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a        wind-dapple here and there,    With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky,        and shadows,    And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,    And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen        homeward returning.           12    Lo, body and soul--this land,    My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides,        and the ships,    The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light,        Ohio’s shores and flashing Missouri,    And ever the far-spreading prairies cover’d with grass and corn.      Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,    The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,    The gentle soft-born measureless light,    The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill’d noon,    The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,    Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.           13    Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,    Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,    Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.      Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,    Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.      O liquid and free and tender!    O wild and loose to my soul--O wondrous singer!    You only I hear--yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,)    Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.           14    Now while I sat in the day and look’d forth,    In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and        the farmers preparing their crops,    In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests,    In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb’d winds and the storms,)    Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the        voices of children and women,    The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail’d,    And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy        with labor,    And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with        its meals and minutia of daily usages,    And the streets how their throbbings throbb’d, and the cities pent--        lo, then and there,    Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,    Appear’d the cloud, appear’d the long black trail,    And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.      Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,    And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,    And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of        companions,    I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,    Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,    To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.      And the singer so shy to the rest receiv’d me,    The gray-brown bird I know receiv’d us comrades three,    And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.      From deep secluded recesses,    From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,    Came the carol of the bird.      And the charm of the carol rapt me,    As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,    And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.      Come lovely and soothing death,    Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,    In the day, in the night, to all, to each,    Sooner or later delicate death.      Prais’d be the fathomless universe,    For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,    And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!    For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.      Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,    Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?    Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,    I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.      Approach strong deliveress,    When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,    Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,    Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death.      From me to thee glad serenades,    Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee,    And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread shy are fitting,    And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.      The night in silence under many a star,    The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,    And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil’d death,    And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.      Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,    Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the        prairies wide,    Over the dense-pack’d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,    I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.           15    To the tally of my soul,    Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,    With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.      Loud in the pines and cedars dim,    Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,    And I with my comrades there in the night.      While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,    As to long panoramas of visions.      And I saw askant the armies,    I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,    Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc’d with missiles I saw them,    And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,    And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)    And the staffs all splinter’d and broken.      I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,    And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,    I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,    But I saw they were not as was thought,    They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer’d not,    The living remain’d and suffer’d, the mother suffer’d,    And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer’d,    And the armies that remain’d suffer’d.           16    Passing the visions, passing the night,    Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades’ hands,    Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,    Victorious song, death’s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,    As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,        flooding the night,    Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again        bursting with joy,    Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,    As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,    Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,    I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.      I cease from my song for thee,    From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,    O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.      Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,    The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,    And the tallying chant, the echo arous’d in my soul,    With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,    With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,    Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for        the dead I loved so well,    For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this for        his dear sake,    Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,    There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.          O Captain! My Captain!      O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,    The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;        But O heart! heart! heart!         O the bleeding drops of red,           Where on the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.      O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;    Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills,    For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding,    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;        Here Captain! dear father!         This arm beneath your head!           It is some dream that on the deck,             You’ve fallen cold and dead.      My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,    The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;         Exult O shores, and ring O bells!           But I with mournful tread,             Walk the deck my Captain lies,               Fallen cold and dead.          Hush’d Be the Camps To-Day [May 4, 1865      Hush’d be the camps to-day,    And soldiers let us drape our war-worn weapons,    And each with musing soul retire to celebrate,    Our dear commander’s death.      No more for him life’s stormy conflicts,    Nor victory, nor defeat--no more time’s dark events,    Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.    But sing poet in our name,      Sing of the love we bore him--because you, dweller in camps, know it truly.      As they invault the coffin there,    Sing--as they close the doors of earth upon him--one verse,    For the heavy hearts of soldiers.          This Dust Was Once the Man      This dust was once the man,    Gentle, plain, just and resolute, under whose cautious hand,    Against the foulest crime in history known in any land or age,    Was saved the Union of these States.          BOOK XXIII      By Blue Ontario’s Shore      By blue Ontario’s shore,    As I mused of these warlike days and of peace return’d, and the        dead that return no more,    A Phantom gigantic superb, with stern visage accosted me,    Chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America,        chant me the carol of victory,    And strike up the marches of Libertad, marches more powerful yet,    And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy.      (Democracy, the destin’d conqueror, yet treacherous lip-smiles everywhere,    And death and infidelity at every step.)           2    A Nation announcing itself,    I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,    I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.      A breed whose proof is in time and deeds,    What we are we are, nativity is answer enough to objections,    We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,    We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,    We are executive in ourselves, we are sufficient in the variety of        ourselves,    We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,    We stand self-pois’d in the middle, branching thence over the world,    From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.      Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,    Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or        sinful in ourselves only.      (O Mother--O Sisters dear!    If we are lost, no victor else has destroy’d us,    It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)           3    Have you thought there could be but a single supreme?    There can be any number of supremes--one does not countervail        another any more than one eyesight countervails another, or        one life countervails another.      All is eligible to all,    All is for individuals, all is for you,    No condition is prohibited, not God’s or any.      All comes by the body, only health puts you rapport with the universe.      Produce great Persons, the rest follows.           4    Piety and conformity to them that like,    Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like,    I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,    Crying, Leap from your seats and contend for your lives!      I am he who walks the States with a barb’d tongue, questioning every        one I meet,    Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before?    Who are you that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?      (With pangs and cries as thine own O bearer of many children,    These clamors wild to a race of pride I give.)      O lands, would you be freer than all that has ever been before?    If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to me.      Fear grace, elegance, civilization, delicatesse,    Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey--juice,    Beware the advancing mortal ripening of Nature,    Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and men.           5    Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,    America brings builders, and brings its own styles.      The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work and        pass’d to other spheres,    A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.      America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all        hazards,    Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, initiates the true use        of precedents,    Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced under        their forms,    Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne        from the house,    Perceives that it waits a little while in the door, that it was        fittest for its days,    That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who        approaches,    And that he shall be fittest for his days.      Any period one nation must lead,    One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.      These States are the amplest poem,    Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations,    Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the        day and night,    Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of particulars,    Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the soul loves,    Here the flowing trains, here the crowds, equality, diversity, the        soul loves.           6    Land of lands and bards to corroborate!    Of them standing among them, one lifts to the light a west-bred face,    To him the hereditary countenance bequeath’d both mother’s and father’s,    His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,    Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,    Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,    Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its neck with        incomparable love,    Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,    Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,    Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,    Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes, Columbia,        Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,    If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch, he        stretching with them North or South,    Spanning between them East and West, and touching whatever is between them,    Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine, cedar, hemlock,        live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, orange, magnolia,    Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp,    He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with        northern transparent ice,    Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,    Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the        fish-hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle,    His spirit surrounding his country’s spirit, unclosed to good and evil,    Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,    Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,    Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and muscle,    The haughty defiance of the Year One, war, peace, the formation of        the Constitution,    The separate States, the simple elastic scheme, the immigrants,    The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and impregnable,    The unsurvey’d interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals,        hunters, trappers,    Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the        gestation of new States,    Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming        up from the uttermost parts,    Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially        the young men,    Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships, the gait they        have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the        presence of superiors,    The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and        decision of their phrenology,    The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when wrong’d,    The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,        good temper and open-handedness, the whole composite make,    The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,    The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement        of the population,    The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,    Wharf-hemm’d cities, railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all points,    Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the Northeast,        Northwest, Southwest,    Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,    Slavery--the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the        ruins of all the rest,    On and on to the grapple with it--Assassin! then your life or ours        be the stake, and respite no more.           7    (Lo, high toward heaven, this day,    Libertad, from the conqueress’ field return’d,    I mark the new aureola around your head,    No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,    With war’s flames and the lambent lightnings playing,    And your port immovable where you stand,    With still the inextinguishable glance and the clinch’d and lifted fist,    And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner utterly        crush’d beneath you,    The menacing arrogant one that strode and advanced with his        senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife,    The wide-swelling one, the braggart that would yesterday do so much,    To-day a carrion dead and damn’d, the despised of all the earth,    An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn’d.)           8    Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive and ever        keeps vista,    Others adorn the past, but you O days of the present, I adorn you,    O days of the future I believe in you--I isolate myself for your sake,    O America because you build for mankind I build for you,    O well-beloved stone-cutters, I lead them who plan with decision        and science,    Lead the present with friendly hand toward the future.    (Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!    But damn that which spends itself with no thought of the stain,        pains, dismay, feebleness, it is bequeathing.)           9    I listened to the Phantom by Ontario’s shore,    I heard the voice arising demanding bards,    By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States be        fused into the compact organism of a Nation.      To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no account,    That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living principle,        as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres of plants.      Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetical stuff most        need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use them the greatest,    Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their        poets shall.      (Soul of love and tongue of fire!    Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world!    Ah Mother, prolific and full in all besides, yet how long barren, barren?)           10    Of these States the poet is the equable man,    Not in him but off from him things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of        their full returns,    Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,    He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither        more nor less,    He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,    He is the equalizer of his age and land,    He supplies what wants supplying, he checks what wants checking,    In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,        thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture, arts,        commerce, lighting the study of man, the soul, health,        immortality, government,    In war he is the best backer of the war, he fetches artillery as        good as the engineer’s, he can make every word he speaks draw blood,    The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith,    He is no arguer, he is judgment, (Nature accepts him absolutely,)    He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun failing round        helpless thing,    As he sees the farthest he has the most faith,    His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,    In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,    He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,    He sees eternity in men and women, he does not see men and women        as dreams or dots.      For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,    For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,    The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.      Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,    They live in the feelings of young men and the best women,    (Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always        ready to fall for Liberty.)           11    For the great Idea,    That, O my brethren, that is the mission of poets.      Songs of stern defiance ever ready,    Songs of the rapid arming and the march,    The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead the flag we know,    Warlike flag of the great Idea.      (Angry cloth I saw there leaping!    I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting,    I sing you over all, flying beckoning through the fight--O the        hard-contested fight!    The cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles--the hurtled balls scream,    The battle-front forms amid the smoke--the volleys pour incessant        from the line,    Hark, the ringing word Charge!--now the tussle and the furious        maddening yells,    Now the corpses tumble curl’d upon the ground,    Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,    Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)           12    Are you he who would assume a place to teach or be a poet here in        the States?    The place is august, the terms obdurate.      Who would assume to teach here may well prepare himself body and mind,    He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe himself,    He shall surely be question’d beforehand by me with many and stern questions.      Who are you indeed who would talk or sing to America?    Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?    Have you learn’d the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography,        pride, freedom, friendship of the land? its substratums and objects?    Have you consider’d the organic compact of the first day of the        first year of Independence, sign’d by the Commissioners, ratified        by the States, and read by Washington at the head of the army?    Have you possess’d yourself of the Federal Constitution?    Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them,        and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy?    Are you faithful to things? do you teach what the land and sea, the        bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, heroic angers, teach?    Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?    Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls,        fierce contentions? are you very strong? are you really of the        whole People?    Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion?    Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to        life itself?    Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these States?    Have you too the old ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality?    Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity? for the        last-born? little and big? and for the errant?      What is this you bring my America?    Is it uniform with my country?    Is it not something that has been better told or done before?    Have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship?    Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness?--Is the good old cause in it?    Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,        literats, of enemies’ lands?    Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?    Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?    Does it sound with trumpet-voice the proud victory of the Union in        that secession war?    Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?    Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air, to appear again in my        strength, gait, face?    Have real employments contributed to it? original makers, not mere        amanuenses?    Does it meet modern discoveries, calibres, facts, face to face?    What does it mean to American persons, progresses, cities? Chicago,        Kanada, Arkansas?    Does it see behind the apparent custodians the real custodians        standing, menacing, silent, the mechanics, Manhattanese, Western        men, Southerners, significant alike in their apathy, and in the        promptness of their love?    Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen,        each temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist,        infidel, who has ever ask’d any thing of America?    What mocking and scornful negligence?    The track strew’d with the dust of skeletons,    By the roadside others disdainfully toss’d.           13    Rhymes and rhymers pass away, poems distill’d from poems pass away,    The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes,    Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soil of literature,    America justifies itself, give it time, no disguise can deceive it        or conceal from it, it is impassive enough,    Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,    If its poets appear it will in due time advance to meet them, there        is no fear of mistake,    (The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr’d till his country        absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb’d it.)      He masters whose spirit masters, he tastes sweetest who results        sweetest in the long run,    The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;    In the need of songs, philosophy, an appropriate native grand-opera,        shipcraft, any craft,    He or she is greatest who contributes the greatest original        practical example.      Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the streets,    People’s lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive knowers,    There will shortly be no more priests, I say their work is done,    Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies here,    Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be superb,    Justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible power;    How dare you place any thing before a man?           14    Fall behind me States!    A man before all--myself, typical, before all.      Give me the pay I have served for,    Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea, take all the rest,    I have loved the earth, sun, animals, I have despised riches,    I have given aims to every one that ask’d, stood up for the stupid        and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others,    Hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and indulgence        toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown,    Gone freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young,        and with the mothers of families,    Read these leaves to myself in the open air, tried them by trees,        stars, rivers,    Dismiss’d whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body,    Claim’d nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim’d for        others on the same terms,    Sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every State,    (Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean’d to breathe his last,    This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish’d, rais’d, restored,    To life recalling many a prostrate form;)    I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of myself,    Rejecting none, permitting all.      (Say O Mother, have I not to your thought been faithful?    Have I not through life kept you and yours before me?)           15    I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things,    It is not the earth, it is not America who is so great,    It is I who am great or to be great, it is You up there, or any one,    It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,    Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals.      Underneath all, individuals,    I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,    The American compact is altogether with individuals,    The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,    The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one        single individual--namely to You.      (Mother! with subtle sense severe, with the naked sword in your hand,    I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)           16    Underneath all, Nativity,    I swear I will stand by my own nativity, pious or impious so be it;    I swear I am charm’d with nothing except nativity,    Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.      Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women,    (I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing        love for men and women,    After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and        women.) in myself,      I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself,    (Talk as you like, he only suits these States whose manners favor        the audacity and sublime turbulence of the States.)      Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,        ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,    Underneath all to me is myself, to you yourself, (the same        monotonous old song.)           17    O I see flashing that this America is only you and me,    Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,    Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, are you and me,    Its Congress is you and me, the officers, capitols, armies, ships,        are you and me,    Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,    The war, (that war so bloody and grim, the war I will henceforth        forget), was you and me,    Natural and artificial are you and me,    Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,    Past, present, future, are you and me.      I dare not shirk any part of myself,    Not any part of America good or bad,    Not to build for that which builds for mankind,    Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,    Not to justify science nor the march of equality,    Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belov’d of time.      I am for those that have never been master’d,    For men and women whose tempers have never been master’d,    For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.      I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth,    Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.      I will not be outfaced by irrational things,    I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,    I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,    This is what I have learnt from America--it is the amount, and it I        teach again.      (Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim’d at your breast,    I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children, saw in dreams        your dilating form,    Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)           18    I will confront these shows of the day and night,    I will know if I am to be less than they,    I will see if I am not as majestic as they,    I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they,    I will see if I am to be less generous than they,    I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have meaning,    I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,        and I am not to be enough for myself.      I match my spirit against yours you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes,    Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself, and become the master myself,    America isolated yet embodying all, what is it finally except myself?    These States, what are they except myself?      I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is for my sake,    I take you specially to be mine, you terrible, rude forms.        (Mother, bend down, bend close to me your face,    I know not what these plots and wars and deferments are for,    I know not fruition’s success, but I know that through war and crime        your work goes on, and must yet go on.)           19    Thus by blue Ontario’s shore,    While the winds fann’d me and the waves came trooping toward me,    I thrill’d with the power’s pulsations, and the charm of my theme        was upon me,    Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me.      And I saw the free souls of poets,    The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,    Strange large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me.           20    O my rapt verse, my call, mock me not!    Not for the bards of the past, not to invoke them have I launch’d        you forth,    Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario’s shores,    Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song.      Bards for my own land only I invoke,    (For the war the war is over, the field is clear’d,)    Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,    To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul.      Bards of the great Idea! bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the        war, the war is over!)    Yet bards of latent armies, a million soldiers waiting ever-ready,    Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightning’s fork’d stripes!    Ample Ohio’s, Kanada’s bards--bards of California! inland bards--        bards of the war!    You by my charm I invoke.          Reversals      Let that which stood in front go behind,    Let that which was behind advance to the front,    Let bigots, fools, unclean persons, offer new propositions,    Let the old propositions be postponed,    Let a man seek pleasure everywhere except in himself,    Let a woman seek happiness everywhere except in herself          BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS      As Consequent, Etc.      As consequent from store of summer rains,    Or wayward rivulets in autumn flowing,    Or many a herb-lined brook’s reticulations,    Or subterranean sea-rills making for the sea,    Songs of continued years I sing.      Life’s ever-modern rapids first, (soon, soon to blend,    With the old streams of death.)      Some threading Ohio’s farm-fields or the woods,    Some down Colorado’s canons from sources of perpetual snow,    Some half-hid in Oregon, or away southward in Texas,    Some in the north finding their way to Erie, Niagara, Ottawa,    Some to Atlantica’s bays, and so to the great salt brine.      In you whoe’er you are my book perusing,    In I myself, in all the world, these currents flowing,    All, all toward the mystic ocean tending.      Currents for starting a continent new,    Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid,    Fusion of ocean and land, tender and pensive waves,    (Not safe and peaceful only, waves rous’d and ominous too,    Out of the depths the storm’s abysmic waves, who knows whence?    Raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and tatter’d sail.)      Or from the sea of Time, collecting vasting all, I bring,    A windrow-drift of weeds and shells.      O little shells, so curious-convolute, so limpid-cold and voiceless,    Will you not little shells to the tympans of temples held,    Murmurs and echoes still call up, eternity’s music faint and far,    Wafted inland, sent from Atlantica’s rim, strains for the soul of        the prairies,    Whisper’d reverberations, chords for the ear of the West joyously sounding,    Your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable,    Infinitesimals out of my life, and many a life,    (For not my life and years alone I give--all, all I give,)    These waifs from the deep, cast high and dry,    Wash’d on America’s shores?          The Return of the Heroes           1    For the lands and for these passionate days and for myself,    Now I awhile retire to thee O soil of autumn fields,    Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to thee,    Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart,    Turning a verse for thee.      O earth that hast no voice, confide to me a voice,    O harvest of my lands--O boundless summer growths,    O lavish brown parturient earth--O infinite teeming womb,    A song to narrate thee.           2    Ever upon this stage,    Is acted God’s calm annual drama,    Gorgeous processions, songs of birds,    Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul,    The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong waves,    The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees,    The liliput countless armies of the grass,    The heat, the showers, the measureless pasturages,    The scenery of the snows, the winds’ free orchestra,    The stretching light-hung roof of clouds, the clear cerulean and the        silvery fringes,    The high-dilating stars, the placid beckoning stars,    The moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,    The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products.           3    Fecund America--today,    Thou art all over set in births and joys!    Thou groan’st with riches, thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing-garment,    Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions,    A myriad-twining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast demesne,    As some huge ship freighted to water’s edge thou ridest into port,    As rain falls from the heaven and vapors rise from earth, so have        the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of thee;    Thou envy of the globe! thou miracle!    Thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty,    Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns,    Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon        thy world, and lookest East and lookest West,    Dispensatress, that by a word givest a thousand miles, a million        farms, and missest nothing,    Thou all-acceptress--thou hospitable, (thou only art hospitable as        God is hospitable.)           4    When late I sang sad was my voice,    Sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and        smoke of war;    In the midst of the conflict, the heroes, I stood,    Or pass’d with slow step through the wounded and dying.      But now I sing not war,    Nor the measur’d march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,    Nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle;    No more the sad, unnatural shows of war.      Ask’d room those flush’d immortal ranks, the first forth-stepping armies?    Ask room alas the ghastly ranks, the armies dread that follow’d.      (Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping sinewy legs,    With your shoulders young and strong, with your knapsacks and your muskets;    How elate I stood and watch’d you, where starting off you march’d.      Pass--then rattle drums again,    For an army heaves in sight, O another gathering army,    Swarming, trailing on the rear, O you dread accruing army,    O you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea, with your fever,    O my land’s maim’d darlings, with the plenteous bloody bandage and        the crutch,    Lo, your pallid army follows.)           5    But on these days of brightness,    On the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes the        high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns,    Should the dead intrude?      Ah the dead to me mar not, they fit well in Nature,    They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass,    And along the edge of the sky in the horizon’s far margin.      Nor do I forget you Departed,    Nor in winter or summer my lost ones,    But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peace,        like pleasing phantoms,    Your memories rising glide silently by me.           6    I saw the day the return of the heroes,    (Yet the heroes never surpass’d shall never return,    Them that day I saw not.)      I saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies,    I saw them approaching, defiling by with divisions,    Streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of        mighty camps.      No holiday soldiers--youthful, yet veterans,    Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and workshop,    Harden’d of many a long campaign and sweaty march,    Inured on many a hard-fought bloody field.      A pause--the armies wait,    A million flush’d embattled conquerors wait,    The world too waits, then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn,    They melt, they disappear.      Exult O lands! victorious lands!    Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields,    But here and hence your victory.      Melt, melt away ye armies--disperse ye blue-clad soldiers,    Resolve ye back again, give up for good your deadly arms,    Other the arms the fields henceforth for you, or South or North,    With saner wars, sweet wars, life-giving wars.           7    Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!    The season of thanks and the voice of full-yielding,    The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.      All till’d and untill’d fields expand before me,    I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,    Man’s innocent and strong arenas.      I see the heroes at other toils,    I see well-wielded in their hands the better weapons.      I see where the Mother of All,    With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long,    And counts the varied gathering of the products.      Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,    Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,    Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane,    Open unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,    Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,    And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook,    And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,    And the good green grass, that delicate miracle the ever-recurring grass.           8    Toil on heroes! harvest the products!    Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All,    With dilated form and lambent eyes watch’d you.      Toil on heroes! toil well! handle the weapons well!    The Mother of All, yet here as ever she watches you.      Well-pleased America thou beholdest,    Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters,    The human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements;    Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the        revolving hay-rakes,    The steam-power reaping-machines and the horse-power machines    The engines, thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain, well        separating the straw, the nimble work of the patent pitchfork,    Beholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the        rice-cleanser.      Beneath thy look O Maternal,    With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest.      All gather and all harvest,    Yet but for thee O Powerful, not a scythe might swing as now in security,    Not a maize-stalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace.      Under thee only they harvest, even but a wisp of hay under thy great        face only,    Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, every barbed spear        under thee,    Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, each ear in its        light-green sheath,    Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns,    Oats to their bins, the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to theirs;    Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama, dig and hoard the        golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,    Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,    Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp or tobacco in the Borders,    Pick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees or bunches        of grapes from the vines,    Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South,    Under the beaming sun and under thee.          There Was a Child Went Forth      There was a child went forth every day,    And the first object he look’d upon, that object he became,    And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day,    Or for many years or stretching cycles of years.      The early lilacs became part of this child,    And grass and white and red morning-glories, and white and red        clover, and the song of the phoebe-bird,    And the Third-month lambs and the sow’s pink-faint litter, and the        mare’s foal and the cow’s calf,    And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond-side,    And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there, and the        beautiful curious liquid,    And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads, all became part of him.      The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part of him,    Winter-grain sprouts and those of the light-yellow corn, and the        esculent roots of the garden,    And the apple-trees cover’d with blossoms and the fruit afterward,        and wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the road,    And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the        tavern whence he had lately risen,    And the schoolmistress that pass’d on her way to the school,    And the friendly boys that pass’d, and the quarrelsome boys,    And the tidy and fresh-cheek’d girls, and the barefoot negro boy and girl,    And all the changes of city and country wherever he went.      His own parents, he that had father’d him and she that had conceiv’d        him in her womb and birth’d him,    They gave this child more of themselves than that,    They gave him afterward every day, they became part of him.      The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table,    The mother with mild words, clean her cap and gown, a wholesome        odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by,    The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger’d, unjust,    The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,    The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture, the        yearning and swelling heart,    Affection that will not be gainsay’d, the sense of what is real, the        thought if after all it should prove unreal,    The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time, the curious        whether and how,    Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?    Men and women crowding fast in the streets, if they are not flashes        and specks what are they?    The streets themselves and the facades of houses, and goods in the windows,    Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank’d wharves, the huge crossing at        the ferries,    The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset, the river between,    Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of        white or brown two miles off,    The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide, the little        boat slack-tow’d astern,    The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,    The strata of color’d clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away        solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in,    The horizon’s edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh        and shore mud,    These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who        now goes, and will always go forth every day.          Old Ireland      Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty,    Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother,    Once a queen, now lean and tatter’d seated on the ground,    Her old white hair drooping dishevel’d round her shoulders,    At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,    Long silent, she too long silent, mourning her shrouded hope and heir,    Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love.      Yet a word ancient mother,    You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with forehead        between your knees,    O you need not sit there veil’d in your old white hair so dishevel’d,    For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave,    It was an illusion, the son you love was not really dead,    The Lord is not dead, he is risen again young and strong in another country,    Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave,    What you wept for was translated, pass’d from the grave,    The winds favor’d and the sea sail’d it,    And now with rosy and new blood,    Moves to-day in a new country.          The City Dead-House      By the city dead-house by the gate,    As idly sauntering wending my way from the clangor,    I curious pause, for lo, an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute brought,    Her corpse they deposit unclaim’d, it lies on the damp brick pavement,    The divine woman, her body, I see the body, I look on it alone,    That house once full of passion and beauty, all else I notice not,    Nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odors        morbific impress me,    But the house alone--that wondrous house--that delicate fair house        --that ruin!    That immortal house more than all the rows of dwellings ever built!    Or white-domed capitol with majestic figure surmounted, or all the        old high-spired cathedrals,    That little house alone more than them all--poor, desperate house!    Fair, fearful wreck--tenement of a soul--itself a soul,    Unclaim’d, avoided house--take one breath from my tremulous lips,    Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you,    Dead house of love--house of madness and sin, crumbled, crush’d,    House of life, erewhile talking and laughing--but ah, poor house,        dead even then,    Months, years, an echoing, garnish’d house--but dead, dead, dead.          This Compost           1    Something startles me where I thought I was safest,    I withdraw from the still woods I loved,    I will not go now on the pastures to walk,    I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea,    I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me.      O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken?    How can you be alive you growths of spring?    How can you furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?    Are they not continually putting distemper’d corpses within you?    Is not every continent work’d over and over with sour dead?      Where have you disposed of their carcasses?    Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations?    Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?    I do not see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I am deceiv’d,    I will run a furrow with my plough, I will press my spade through        the sod and turn it up underneath,    I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.           2    Behold this compost! behold it well!    Perhaps every mite has once form’d part of a sick person--yet behold!    The grass of spring covers the prairies,    The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,    The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,    The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,    The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,    The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,    The he-birds carol mornings and evenings while the she-birds sit on        their nests,    The young of poultry break through the hatch’d eggs,    The new-born of animals appear, the calf is dropt from the cow, the        colt from the mare,    Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato’s dark green leaves,    Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk, the lilacs bloom in        the dooryards,    The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata        of sour dead.      What chemistry!    That the winds are really not infectious,    That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea which        is so amorous after me,    That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues,    That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited        themselves in it,    That all is clean forever and forever,    That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,    That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,    That the fruits of the apple-orchard and the orange-orchard, that        melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,    That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,    Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once        catching disease.      Now I am terrified at the Earth, it is that calm and patient,    It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,    It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless        successions of diseas’d corpses,    It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,    It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,    It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings        from them at last.          To a Foil’d European Revolutionaire      Courage yet, my brother or my sister!    Keep on--Liberty is to be subserv’d whatever occurs;    That is nothing that is quell’d by one or two failures, or any        number of failures,    Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any        unfaithfulness,    Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes.      What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents,    Invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and light, is        positive and composed, knows no discouragement,    Waiting patiently, waiting its time.      (Not songs of loyalty alone are these,    But songs of insurrection also,    For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over,    And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him,    And stakes his life to be lost at any moment.)      The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and retreat,    The infidel triumphs, or supposes he triumphs,    The prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron necklace and        leadballs do their work,    The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,    The great speakers and writers are exiled, they lie sick in distant lands,    The cause is asleep, the strongest throats are choked with their own blood,    The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet;    But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the        infidel enter’d into full possession.      When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go, nor the        second or third to go,    It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last.      When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,    And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged        from any part of the earth,    Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from        that part of the earth,    And the infidel come into full possession.      Then courage European revolter, revoltress!    For till all ceases neither must you cease.      I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what I am for myself,        nor what any thing is for,)    But I will search carefully for it even in being foil’d,    In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment--for they too are great.      Did we think victory great?    So it is--but now it seems to me, when it cannot be help’d, that        defeat is great,    And that death and dismay are great.          Unnamed Land      Nations ten thousand years before these States, and many times ten        thousand years before these States,    Garner’d clusters of ages that men and women like us grew up and        travel’d their course and pass’d on,    What vast-built cities, what orderly republics, what pastoral tribes        and nomads,    What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others,    What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions,    What sort of marriage, what costumes, what physiology and phrenology,    What of liberty and slavery among them, what they thought of death        and the soul,    Who were witty and wise, who beautiful and poetic, who brutish and        undevelop’d,    Not a mark, not a record remains--and yet all remains.      O I know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more        than we are for nothing,    I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much        as we now belong to it.      Afar they stand, yet near to me they stand,    Some with oval countenances learn’d and calm,    Some naked and savage, some like huge collections of insects,    Some in tents, herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,    Some prowling through woods, some living peaceably on farms,        laboring, reaping, filling barns,    Some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories,        libraries, shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments.    Are those billions of men really gone?    Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?    Do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?    Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves?      I believe of all those men and women that fill’d the unnamed lands,        every one exists this hour here or elsewhere, invisible to us.    In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and out of        what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinn’d, in life.      I believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of        them, any more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of me;    Of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products,        games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets,    I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world,        counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world,    I suspect I shall meet them there,    I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands.          Song of Prudence      Manhattan’s streets I saunter’d pondering,    On Time, Space, Reality--on such as these, and abreast with them Prudence.      The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence,    Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that        suits immortality.      The soul is of itself,    All verges to it, all has reference to what ensues,    All that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence,    Not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day,        month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death,    But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the        indirect lifetime.      The indirect is just as much as the direct,    The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the        body, if not more.      Not one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of        the onanist,    Putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning,        betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution,    But has results beyond death as really as before death.      Charity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing.      No specification is necessary, all that a male or female does, that        is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or her,    In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope        of it forever.      Who has been wise receives interest,    Savage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat,        young, old, it is the same,    The interest will come round--all will come round.      Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect,        all of the past and all of the present and all of the future,    All the brave actions of war and peace,    All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful,        young children, widows, the sick, and to shunn’d persons,    All self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw        others fill the seats of the boats,    All offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a        friend’s sake, or opinion’s sake,    All pains of enthusiasts scoff’d at by their neighbors,    All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,    All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,    All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,    All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name,        date, location,    All that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,    All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his        mouth, or the shaping of his great hands,    All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe,        or on any of the wandering stars, or on any of the fix’d stars,        by those there as we are here,    All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are,        or by any one,    These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which        they sprang, or shall spring.      Did you guess any thing lived only its moment?    The world does not so exist, no parts palpable or impalpable so exist,    No consummation exists without being from some long previous        consummation, and that from some other,    Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the        beginning than any.      Whatever satisfies souls is true;    Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls,    Itself only finally satisfies the soul,    The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson        but its own.      Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time,        space, reality,    That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.      What is prudence is indivisible,    Declines to separate one part of life from every part,    Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead,    Matches every thought or act by its correlative,    Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement,    Knows that the young man who composedly peril’d his life and lost it        has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,    That he who never peril’d his life, but retains it to old age in        riches and ease, has probably achiev’d nothing for himself worth        mentioning,    Knows that only that person has really learn’d who has learn’d to        prefer results,    Who favors body and soul the same,    Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,    Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor        avoids death.          The Singer in the Prison              O sight of pity, shame and dole!            O fearful thought--a convict soul.           1    Rang the refrain along the hall, the prison,    Rose to the roof, the vaults of heaven above,    Pouring in floods of melody in tones so pensive sweet and strong the        like whereof was never heard,    Reaching the far-off sentry and the armed guards, who ceas’d their pacing,    Making the hearer’s pulses stop for ecstasy and awe.           2    The sun was low in the west one winter day,    When down a narrow aisle amid the thieves and outlaws of the land,    (There by the hundreds seated, sear-faced murderers, wily counterfeiters,    Gather’d to Sunday church in prison walls, the keepers round,    Plenteous, well-armed, watching with vigilant eyes,)    Calmly a lady walk’d holding a little innocent child by either hand,    Whom seating on their stools beside her on the platform,    She, first preluding with the instrument a low and musical prelude,    In voice surpassing all, sang forth a quaint old hymn.           A soul confined by bars and bands,         Cries, help! O help! and wrings her hands,         Blinded her eyes, bleeding her breast,         Nor pardon finds, nor balm of rest.           Ceaseless she paces to and fro,         O heart-sick days! O nights of woe!         Nor hand of friend, nor loving face,         Nor favor comes, nor word of grace.           It was not I that sinn’d the sin,         The ruthless body dragg’d me in;         Though long I strove courageously,         The body was too much for me.           Dear prison’d soul bear up a space,         For soon or late the certain grace;         To set thee free and bear thee home,         The heavenly pardoner death shall come.              Convict no more, nor shame, nor dole!            Depart--a God-enfranchis’d soul!           3    The singer ceas’d,    One glance swept from her clear calm eyes o’er all those upturn’d faces,    Strange sea of prison faces, a thousand varied, crafty, brutal,        seam’d and beauteous faces,    Then rising, passing back along the narrow aisle between them,    While her gown touch’d them rustling in the silence,    She vanish’d with her children in the dusk.      While upon all, convicts and armed keepers ere they stirr’d,    (Convict forgetting prison, keeper his loaded pistol,)    A hush and pause fell down a wondrous minute,    With deep half-stifled sobs and sound of bad men bow’d and moved to weeping,    And youth’s convulsive breathings, memories of home,    The mother’s voice in lullaby, the sister’s care, the happy childhood,    The long-pent spirit rous’d to reminiscence;    A wondrous minute then--but after in the solitary night, to many,        many there,    Years after, even in the hour of death, the sad refrain, the tune,        the voice, the words,    Resumed, the large calm lady walks the narrow aisle,    The wailing melody again, the singer in the prison sings,           O sight of pity, shame and dole!         O fearful thought--a convict soul.          Warble for Lilac-Time      Warble me now for joy of lilac-time, (returning in reminiscence,)    Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature’s sake, souvenirs of earliest summer,    Gather the welcome signs, (as children with pebbles or stringing shells,)    Put in April and May, the hylas croaking in the ponds, the elastic air,    Bees, butterflies, the sparrow with its simple notes,    Blue-bird and darting swallow, nor forget the high-hole flashing his        golden wings,    The tranquil sunny haze, the clinging smoke, the vapor,    Shimmer of waters with fish in them, the cerulean above,    All that is jocund and sparkling, the brooks running,    The maple woods, the crisp February days and the sugar-making,    The robin where he hops, bright-eyed, brown-breasted,    With musical clear call at sunrise, and again at sunset,    Or flitting among the trees of the apple-orchard, building the nest        of his mate,    The melted snow of March, the willow sending forth its yellow-green sprouts,    For spring-time is here! the summer is here! and what is this in it        and from it?    Thou, soul, unloosen’d--the restlessness after I know not what;    Come, let us lag here no longer, let us be up and away!    O if one could but fly like a bird!    O to escape, to sail forth as in a ship!    To glide with thee O soul, o’er all, in all, as a ship o’er the waters;    Gathering these hints, the preludes, the blue sky, the grass, the        morning drops of dew,    The lilac-scent, the bushes with dark green heart-shaped leaves,    Wood-violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence,    Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmosphere,    To grace the bush I love--to sing with the birds,    A warble for joy of returning in reminiscence.          Outlines for a Tomb [G. P., Buried 1870]           1    What may we chant, O thou within this tomb?    What tablets, outlines, hang for thee, O millionnaire?    The life thou lived’st we know not,    But that thou walk’dst thy years in barter, ’mid the haunts of        brokers,    Nor heroism thine, nor war, nor glory.           2    Silent, my soul,    With drooping lids, as waiting, ponder’d,    Turning from all the samples, monuments of heroes.      While through the interior vistas,    Noiseless uprose, phantasmic, (as by night Auroras of the north,)    Lambent tableaus, prophetic, bodiless scenes,    Spiritual projections.      In one, among the city streets a laborer’s home appear’d,    After his day’s work done, cleanly, sweet-air’d, the gaslight burning,    The carpet swept and a fire in the cheerful stove.      In one, the sacred parturition scene,    A happy painless mother birth’d a perfect child.      In one, at a bounteous morning meal,    Sat peaceful parents with contented sons.      In one, by twos and threes, young people,    Hundreds concentring, walk’d the paths and streets and roads,    Toward a tall-domed school.      In one a trio beautiful,    Grandmother, loving daughter, loving daughter’s daughter, sat,    Chatting and sewing.      In one, along a suite of noble rooms,    ’Mid plenteous books and journals, paintings on the walls, fine statuettes,    Were groups of friendly journeymen, mechanics young and old,    Reading, conversing.      All, all the shows of laboring life,    City and country, women’s, men’s and children’s,    Their wants provided for, hued in the sun and tinged for once with joy,    Marriage, the street, the factory, farm, the house-room, lodging-room,    Labor and toll, the bath, gymnasium, playground, library, college,    The student, boy or girl, led forward to be taught,    The sick cared for, the shoeless shod, the orphan father’d and mother’d,    The hungry fed, the houseless housed;    (The intentions perfect and divine,    The workings, details, haply human.)           3    O thou within this tomb,    From thee such scenes, thou stintless, lavish giver,    Tallying the gifts of earth, large as the earth,    Thy name an earth, with mountains, fields and tides.      Nor by your streams alone, you rivers,    By you, your banks Connecticut,    By you and all your teeming life old Thames,    By you Potomac laving the ground Washington trod, by you Patapsco,    You Hudson, you endless Mississippi--nor you alone,    But to the high seas launch, my thought, his memory.          Out from Behind This Mask [To Confront a Portrait]           1    Out from behind this bending rough-cut mask,    These lights and shades, this drama of the whole,    This common curtain of the face contain’d in me for me, in you for        you, in each for each,    (Tragedies, sorrows, laughter, tears--0 heaven!    The passionate teeming plays this curtain hid!)    This glaze of God’s serenest purest sky,    This film of Satan’s seething pit,    This heart’s geography’s map, this limitless small continent, this        soundless sea;    Out from the convolutions of this globe,    This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon, than Jupiter, Venus, Mars,    This condensation of the universe, (nay here the only universe,    Here the idea, all in this mystic handful wrapt;)    These burin’d eyes, flashing to you to pass to future time,    To launch and spin through space revolving sideling, from these to emanate,    To you whoe’er you are--a look.           2    A traveler of thoughts and years, of peace and war,    Of youth long sped and middle age declining,    (As the first volume of a tale perused and laid away, and this the second,    Songs, ventures, speculations, presently to close,)    Lingering a moment here and now, to you I opposite turn,    As on the road or at some crevice door by chance, or open’d window,    Pausing, inclining, baring my head, you specially I greet,    To draw and clinch your soul for once inseparably with mine,    Then travel travel on.          Vocalism           1    Vocalism, measure, concentration, determination, and the divine        power to speak words;    Are you full-lung’d and limber-lipp’d from long trial? from vigorous        practice? from physique?    Do you move in these broad lands as broad as they?    Come duly to the divine power to speak words?    For only at last after many years, after chastity, friendship,        procreation, prudence, and nakedness,    After treading ground and breasting river and lake,    After a loosen’d throat, after absorbing eras, temperaments, races,        after knowledge, freedom, crimes,    After complete faith, after clarifyings, elevations, and removing        obstructions,    After these and more, it is just possible there comes to a man,        woman, the divine power to speak words;    Then toward that man or that woman swiftly hasten all--none        refuse, all attend,    Armies, ships, antiquities, libraries, paintings, machines, cities,        hate, despair, amity, pain, theft, murder, aspiration, form in        close ranks,    They debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through the        mouth of that man or that woman.           2    O what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?    Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall follow,    As the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps, anywhere        around the globe.      All waits for the right voices;    Where is the practis’d and perfect organ? where is the develop’d soul?    For I see every word utter’d thence has deeper, sweeter, new sounds,        impossible on less terms.      I see brains and lips closed, tympans and temples unstruck,    Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose,    Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies        slumbering forever ready in all words.          To Him That Was Crucified      My spirit to yours dear brother,    Do not mind because many sounding your name do not understand you,    I do not sound your name, but I understand you,    I specify you with joy O my comrade to salute you, and to salute        those who are with you, before and since, and those to come also,    That we all labor together transmitting the same charge and succession,    We few equals indifferent of lands, indifferent of times,    We, enclosers of all continents, all castes, allowers of all theologies,    Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,    We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the        disputers nor any thing that is asserted,    We hear the bawling and din, we are reach’d at by divisions,        jealousies, recriminations on every side,    They close peremptorily upon us to surround us, my comrade,    Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, journeying up and        down till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the diverse eras,    Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races,        ages to come, may prove brethren and lovers as we are.          You Felons on Trial in Courts      You felons on trial in courts,    You convicts in prison-cells, you sentenced assassins chain’d and        handcuff’d with iron,    Who am I too that I am not on trial or in prison?    Me ruthless and devilish as any, that my wrists are not chain’d with        iron, or my ankles with iron?      You prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs or obscene in your rooms,    Who am I that I should call you more obscene than myself?      O culpable! I acknowledge--I expose!    (O admirers, praise not me--compliment not me--you make me wince,    I see what you do not--I know what you do not.)      Inside these breast-bones I lie smutch’d and choked,    Beneath this face that appears so impassive hell’s tides continually run,    Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me,    I walk with delinquents with passionate love,    I feel I am of them--I belong to those convicts and prostitutes myself,    And henceforth I will not deny them--for how can I deny myself?          Laws for Creations      Laws for creations,    For strong artists and leaders, for fresh broods of teachers and        perfect literats for America,    For noble savans and coming musicians.    All must have reference to the ensemble of the world, and the        compact truth of the world,    There shall be no subject too pronounced--all works shall illustrate        the divine law of indirections.      What do you suppose creation is?    What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk free and        own no superior?    What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways, but        that man or woman is as good as God?    And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself?    And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean?    And that you or any one must approach creations through such laws?          To a Common Prostitute      Be composed--be at ease with me--I am Walt Whitman, liberal and        lusty as Nature,    Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude you,    Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to        rustle for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you.      My girl I appoint with you an appointment, and I charge you that you        make preparation to be worthy to meet me,    And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come.      Till then I salute you with a significant look that you do not forget me.          I Was Looking a Long While      I was looking a long while for Intentions,    For a clew to the history of the past for myself, and for these        chants--and now I have found it,    It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither        accept nor reject,)    It is no more in the legends than in all else,    It is in the present--it is this earth to-day,    It is in Democracy--(the purport and aim of all the past,)    It is the life of one man or one woman to-day--the average man of to-day,    It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts,    It is in the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery,        politics, creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of nations,    All for the modern--all for the average man of to-day.          Thought      Of persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth,        scholarships, and the like;    (To me all that those persons have arrived at sinks away from them,        except as it results to their bodies and souls,    So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked,    And often to me each one mocks the others, and mocks himself or herself,    And of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full of the        rotten excrement of maggots,    And often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true        realities of life, and go toward false realities,    And often to me they are alive after what custom has served them,        but nothing more,    And often to me they are sad, hasty, unwaked sonnambules walking the dusk.)          Miracles      Why, who makes much of a miracle?    As to me I know of nothing else but miracles,    Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,    Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,    Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water,    Or stand under trees in the woods,    Or talk by day with any one I love, or sleep in the bed at night        with any one I love,    Or sit at table at dinner with the rest,    Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,    Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon,    Or animals feeding in the fields,    Or birds, or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,    Or the wonderfulness of the sundown, or of stars shining so quiet        and bright,    Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring;    These with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,    The whole referring, yet each distinct and in its place.      To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,    Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,    Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,    Every foot of the interior swarms with the same.    To me the sea is a continual miracle,    The fishes that swim--the rocks--the motion of the waves--the        ships with men in them,    What stranger miracles are there?          Sparkles from the Wheel      Where the city’s ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day,    Withdrawn I join a group of children watching, I pause aside with them.      By the curb toward the edge of the flagging,    A knife-grinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife,    Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone, by foot and knee,    With measur’d tread he turns rapidly, as he presses with light but        firm hand,    Forth issue then in copious golden jets,    Sparkles from the wheel.      The scene and all its belongings, how they seize and affect me,    The sad sharp-chinn’d old man with worn clothes and broad        shoulder-band of leather,    Myself effusing and fluid, a phantom curiously floating, now here        absorb’d and arrested,    The group, (an unminded point set in a vast surrounding,)    The attentive, quiet children, the loud, proud, restive base of the streets,    The low hoarse purr of the whirling stone, the light-press’d blade,    Diffusing, dropping, sideways-darting, in tiny showers of gold,    Sparkles from the wheel.          To a Pupil      Is reform needed? is it through you?    The greater the reform needed, the greater the Personality you need        to accomplish it.      You! do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood,        complexion, clean and sweet?    Do you not see how it would serve to have such a body and soul that        when you enter the crowd an atmosphere of desire and command        enters with you, and every one is impress’d with your Personality?      O the magnet! the flesh over and over!    Go, dear friend, if need be give up all else, and commence to-day to        inure yourself to pluck, reality, self-esteem, definiteness,        elevatedness,    Rest not till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality.          Unfolded out of the Folds      Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded, and is        always to come unfolded,    Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come the        superbest man of the earth,    Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come the friendliest man,    Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman can a man be        form’d of perfect body,    Unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come the        poems of man, (only thence have my poems come;)    Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love, only thence        can appear the strong and arrogant man I love,    Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well-muscled woman        love, only thence come the brawny embraces of the man,    Unfolded out of the folds of the woman’s brain come all the folds        of the man’s brain, duly obedient,    Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded,    Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy;    A man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity, but        every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman;    First the man is shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in himself.          What Am I After All      What am I after all but a child, pleas’d with the sound of my own        name? repeating it over and over;    I stand apart to hear--it never tires me.      To you your name also;    Did you think there was nothing but two or three pronunciations in        the sound of your name?          Kosmos      Who includes diversity and is Nature,    Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of        the earth, and the great charity of the earth, and the equilibrium also,    Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing,        or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,    Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,    Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism,        spiritualism, and of the aesthetic or intellectual,    Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,    Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body        understands by subtle analogies all other theories,    The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;    Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in        other globes with their suns and moons,    Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day        but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,    The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.          Others May Praise What They Like      Others may praise what they like;    But I, from the banks of the running Missouri, praise nothing in art        or aught else,    Till it has well inhaled the atmosphere of this river, also the        western prairie-scent,    And exudes it all again.          Who Learns My Lesson Complete?      Who learns my lesson complete?    Boss, journeyman, apprentice, churchman and atheist,    The stupid and the wise thinker, parents and offspring, merchant,        clerk, porter and customer,    Editor, author, artist, and schoolboy--draw nigh and commence;    It is no lesson--it lets down the bars to a good lesson,    And that to another, and every one to another still.      The great laws take and effuse without argument,    I am of the same style, for I am their friend,    I love them quits and quits, I do not halt and make salaams.      I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons        of things,    They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.      I cannot say to any person what I hear--I cannot say it to myself--        it is very wonderful.      It is no small matter, this round and delicious globe moving so        exactly in its orbit for ever and ever, without one jolt or        the untruth of a single second,    I do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years,        nor ten billions of years,    Nor plann’d and built one thing after another as an architect plans        and builds a house.      I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman,    Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman,    Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me, or any one else.      Is it wonderful that I should be immortal? as every one is immortal;    I know it is wonderful, but my eyesight is equally wonderful, and        how I was conceived in my mother’s womb is equally wonderful,    And pass’d from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of        summers and winters to articulate and walk--all this is        equally wonderful.      And that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other        without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see        each other, is every bit as wonderful.      And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful,    And that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to        be true, is just as wonderful.      And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth, is        equally wonderful,    And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally        wonderful.          Tests      All submit to them where they sit, inner, secure, unapproachable to        analysis in the soul,    Not traditions, not the outer authorities are the judges,    They are the judges of outer authorities and of all traditions,    They corroborate as they go only whatever corroborates themselves,        and touches themselves;    For all that, they have it forever in themselves to corroborate far        and near without one exception.          The Torch      On my Northwest coast in the midst of the night a fishermen’s group        stands watching,    Out on the lake that expands before them, others are spearing salmon,    The canoe, a dim shadowy thing, moves across the black water,    Bearing a torch ablaze at the prow.          O Star of France [1870-71]      O star of France,    The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame,    Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long,    Beseems to-day a wreck driven by the gale, a mastless hulk,    And ’mid its teeming madden’d half-drown’d crowds,    Nor helm nor helmsman.      Dim smitten star,    Orb not of France alone, pale symbol of my soul, its dearest hopes,    The struggle and the daring, rage divine for liberty,    Of aspirations toward the far ideal, enthusiast’s dreams of brotherhood,    Of terror to the tyrant and the priest.      Star crucified--by traitors sold,    Star panting o’er a land of death, heroic land,    Strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land.      Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke thee,    Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell’d them all,    And left thee sacred.      In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly,    In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price,    In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg’d sleep,    In that alone among thy sisters thou, giantess, didst rend the ones        that shamed thee,    In that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains,    This cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet,    The spear thrust in thy side.      O star! O ship of France, beat back and baffled long!    Bear up O smitten orb! O ship continue on!      Sure as the ship of all, the Earth itself,    Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos,    Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons,    Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty,    Onward beneath the sun following its course,    So thee O ship of France!      Finish’d the days, the clouds dispel’d    The travail o’er, the long-sought extrication,    When lo! reborn, high o’er the European world,    (In gladness answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours        Columbia,)    Again thy star O France, fair lustrous star,    In heavenly peace, clearer, more bright than ever,    Shall beam immortal.          The Ox-Tamer      In a far-away northern county in the placid pastoral region,    Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, a famous tamer of oxen,    There they bring him the three-year-olds and the four-year-olds to        break them,    He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and tame him,    He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock        chafes up and down the yard,    The bullock’s head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes,    Yet see you! how soon his rage subsides--how soon this tamer tames him;    See you! on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old,        and he is the man who has tamed them,    They all know him, all are affectionate to him;    See you! some are such beautiful animals, so lofty looking;    Some are buff-color’d, some mottled, one has a white line running        along his back, some are brindled,    Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)--see you! the bright hides,    See, the two with stars on their foreheads--see, the round bodies        and broad backs,    How straight and square they stand on their legs--what fine sagacious eyes!    How straight they watch their tamer--they wish him near them--how        they turn to look after him!    What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves away from them;    Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics,        poems, depart--all else departs,)    I confess I envy only his fascination--my silent, illiterate friend,    Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms,    In the northern county far, in the placid pastoral region.          An Old Man’s Thought of School    [For the Inauguration of a Public School, Camden, New Jersey, 1874]      An old man’s thought of school,    An old man gathering youthful memories and blooms that youth itself cannot.      Now only do I know you,    O fair auroral skies--O morning dew upon the grass!      And these I see, these sparkling eyes,    These stores of mystic meaning, these young lives,    Building, equipping like a fleet of ships, immortal ships,    Soon to sail out over the measureless seas,    On the soul’s voyage.      Only a lot of boys and girls?    Only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes?    Only a public school?      Ah more, infinitely more;    (As George Fox rais’d his warning cry, “Is it this pile of brick and        mortar, these dead floors, windows, rails, you call the church?    Why this is not the church at all--the church is living, ever living        souls.”)      And you America,    Cast you the real reckoning for your present?    The lights and shadows of your future, good or evil?    To girlhood, boyhood look, the teacher and the school.          Wandering at Morn      Wandering at morn,    Emerging from the night from gloomy thoughts, thee in my thoughts,    Yearning for thee harmonious Union! thee, singing bird divine!    Thee coil’d in evil times my country, with craft and black dismay,        with every meanness, treason thrust upon thee,    This common marvel I beheld--the parent thrush I watch’d feeding its young,    The singing thrush whose tones of joy and faith ecstatic,    Fail not to certify and cheer my soul.      There ponder’d, felt I,    If worms, snakes, loathsome grubs, may to sweet spiritual songs be turn’d,    If vermin so transposed, so used and bless’d may be,    Then may I trust in you, your fortunes, days, my country;    Who knows but these may be the lessons fit for you?    From these your future song may rise with joyous trills,    Destin’d to fill the world.          Italian Music in Dakota    [“The Seventeenth--the finest Regimental Band I ever heard.”]      Through the soft evening air enwinding all,    Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless wilds,    In dulcet streams, in flutes’ and cornets’ notes,    Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial,    (Yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown before,    Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, related here,    Not to the city’s fresco’d rooms, not to the audience of the opera house,    Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at home,    Sonnambula’s innocent love, trios with Norma’s anguish,    And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto;)    Ray’d in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,    Music, Italian music in Dakota.      While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl’d realm,    Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,    Acknowledging rapport however far remov’d,    (As some old root or soil of earth its last-born flower or fruit,)    Listens well pleas’d.          With All Thy Gifts      With all thy gifts America,    Standing secure, rapidly tending, overlooking the world,    Power, wealth, extent, vouchsafed to thee--with these and like of        these vouchsafed to thee,    What if one gift thou lackest? (the ultimate human problem never solving,)    The gift of perfect women fit for thee--what if that gift of gifts        thou lackest?    The towering feminine of thee? the beauty, health, completion, fit for thee?    The mothers fit for thee?          My Picture-Gallery      In a little house keep I pictures suspended, it is not a fix’d house,    It is round, it is only a few inches from one side to the other;    Yet behold, it has room for all the shows of the world, all memories!    Here the tableaus of life, and here the groupings of death;    Here, do you know this? this is cicerone himself,    With finger rais’d he points to the prodigal pictures.          The Prairie States      A newer garden of creation, no primal solitude,    Dense, joyous, modern, populous millions, cities and farms,    With iron interlaced, composite, tied, many in one,    By all the world contributed--freedom’s and law’s and thrift’s society,    The crown and teeming paradise, so far, of time’s accumulations,    To justify the past.          BOOK XXV      Proud Music of the Storm           1    Proud music of the storm,    Blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies,    Strong hum of forest tree-tops--wind of the mountains,    Personified dim shapes--you hidden orchestras,    You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert,    Blending with Nature’s rhythmus all the tongues of nations;    You chords left as by vast composers--you choruses,    You formless, free, religious dances--you from the Orient,    You undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts,    You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry,    Echoes of camps with all the different bugle-calls,    Trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me powerless,    Entering my lonesome slumber-chamber, why have you seiz’d me?            2    Come forward O my soul, and let the rest retire,    Listen, lose not, it is toward thee they tend,    Parting the midnight, entering my slumber-chamber,    For thee they sing and dance O soul.      A festival song,    The duet of the bridegroom and the bride, a marriage-march,    With lips of love, and hearts of lovers fill’d to the brim with love,    The red-flush’d cheeks and perfumes, the cortege swarming full of        friendly faces young and old,    To flutes’ clear notes and sounding harps’ cantabile.      Now loud approaching drums,    Victoria! seest thou in powder-smoke the banners torn but flying?        the rout of the baffled?    Hearest those shouts of a conquering army?      (Ah soul, the sobs of women, the wounded groaning in agony,    The hiss and crackle of flames, the blacken’d ruins, the embers of cities,    The dirge and desolation of mankind.)      Now airs antique and mediaeval fill me,    I see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh festivals,    I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love,    I hear the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the middle ages.      Now the great organ sounds,    Tremulous, while underneath, (as the hid footholds of the earth,    On which arising rest, and leaping forth depend,    All shapes of beauty, grace and strength, all hues we know,    Green blades of grass and warbling birds, children that gambol and        play, the clouds of heaven above,)    The strong base stands, and its pulsations intermits not,    Bathing, supporting, merging all the rest, maternity of all the rest,    And with it every instrument in multitudes,    The players playing, all the world’s musicians,    The solemn hymns and masses rousing adoration,    All passionate heart-chants, sorrowful appeals,    The measureless sweet vocalists of ages,    And for their solvent setting earth’s own diapason,    Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves,    A new composite orchestra, binder of years and climes, ten-fold renewer,    As of the far-back days the poets tell, the Paradiso,    The straying thence, the separation long, but now the wandering done,    The journey done, the journeyman come home,    And man and art with Nature fused again.      Tutti! for earth and heaven;    (The Almighty leader now for once has signal’d with his wand.)      The manly strophe of the husbands of the world,    And all the wives responding.      The tongues of violins,    (I think O tongues ye tell this heart, that cannot tell itself,    This brooding yearning heart, that cannot tell itself.)           3    Ah from a little child,    Thou knowest soul how to me all sounds became music,    My mother’s voice in lullaby or hymn,    (The voice, O tender voices, memory’s loving voices,    Last miracle of all, O dearest mother’s, sister’s, voices;)    The rain, the growing corn, the breeze among the long-leav’d corn,    The measur’d sea-surf beating on the sand,    The twittering bird, the hawk’s sharp scream,    The wild-fowl’s notes at night as flying low migrating north or south,    The psalm in the country church or mid the clustering trees, the        open air camp-meeting,    The fiddler in the tavern, the glee, the long-strung sailor-song,    The lowing cattle, bleating sheep, the crowing cock at dawn.      All songs of current lands come sounding round me,    The German airs of friendship, wine and love,    Irish ballads, merry jigs and dances, English warbles,    Chansons of France, Scotch tunes, and o’er the rest,    Italia’s peerless compositions.      Across the stage with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion,    Stalks Norma brandishing the dagger in her hand.      I see poor crazed Lucia’s eyes’ unnatural gleam,    Her hair down her back falls loose and dishevel’d.      I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden,    Amid the scent of night-roses, radiant, holding his bride by the hand,    Hears the infernal call, the death-pledge of the horn.      To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven,    The clear electric base and baritone of the world,    The trombone duo, Libertad forever!    From Spanish chestnut trees’ dense shade,    By old and heavy convent walls a wailing song,    Song of lost love, the torch of youth and life quench’d in despair,    Song of the dying swan, Fernando’s heart is breaking.      Awaking from her woes at last retriev’d Amina sings,    Copious as stars and glad as morning light the torrents of her joy.      (The teeming lady comes,    The lustrious orb, Venus contralto, the blooming mother,    Sister of loftiest gods, Alboni’s self I hear.)           4    I hear those odes, symphonies, operas,    I hear in the William Tell the music of an arous’d and angry people,    I hear Meyerbeer’s Huguenots, the Prophet, or Robert,    Gounod’s Faust, or Mozart’s Don Juan.      I hear the dance-music of all nations,    The waltz, some delicious measure, lapsing, bathing me in bliss,    The bolero to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets.      I see religious dances old and new,    I hear the sound of the Hebrew lyre,    I see the crusaders marching bearing the cross on high, to the        martial clang of cymbals,    I hear dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers’d with frantic        shouts, as they spin around turning always towards Mecca,    I see the rapt religious dances of the Persians and the Arabs,    Again, at Eleusis, home of Ceres, I see the modern Greeks dancing,    I hear them clapping their hands as they bend their bodies,    I hear the metrical shuffling of their feet.      I see again the wild old Corybantian dance, the performers wounding        each other,    I see the Roman youth to the shrill sound of flageolets throwing and        catching their weapons,    As they fall on their knees and rise again.      I hear from the Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling,    I see the worshippers within, nor form nor sermon, argument nor word,    But silent, strange, devout, rais’d, glowing heads, ecstatic faces.      I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings,    The primitive chants of the Nile boatmen,    The sacred imperial hymns of China,    To the delicate sounds of the king, (the stricken wood and stone,)    Or to Hindu flutes and the fretting twang of the vina,    A band of bayaderes.           5    Now Asia, Africa leave me, Europe seizing inflates me,    To organs huge and bands I hear as from vast concourses of voices,    Luther’s strong hymn Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott,    Rossini’s Stabat Mater dolorosa,    Or floating in some high cathedral dim with gorgeous color’d windows,    The passionate Agnus Dei or Gloria in Excelsis.      Composers! mighty maestros!    And you, sweet singers of old lands, soprani, tenori, bassi!    To you a new bard caroling in the West,    Obeisant sends his love.      (Such led to thee O soul,    All senses, shows and objects, lead to thee,    But now it seems to me sound leads o’er all the rest.)      I hear the annual singing of the children in St. Paul’s cathedral,    Or, under the high roof of some colossal hall, the symphonies,        oratorios of Beethoven, Handel, or Haydn,    The Creation in billows of godhood laves me.      Give me to hold all sounds, (I madly struggling cry,)    Fill me with all the voices of the universe,    Endow me with their throbbings, Nature’s also,    The tempests, waters, winds, operas and chants, marches and dances,    Utter, pour in, for I would take them all!           6    Then I woke softly,    And pausing, questioning awhile the music of my dream,    And questioning all those reminiscences, the tempest in its fury,    And all the songs of sopranos and tenors,    And those rapt oriental dances of religious fervor,    And the sweet varied instruments, and the diapason of organs,    And all the artless plaints of love and grief and death,    I said to my silent curious soul out of the bed of the slumber-chamber,    Come, for I have found the clew I sought so long,    Let us go forth refresh’d amid the day,    Cheerfully tallying life, walking the world, the real,    Nourish’d henceforth by our celestial dream.      And I said, moreover,    Haply what thou hast heard O soul was not the sound of winds,    Nor dream of raging storm, nor sea-hawk’s flapping wings nor harsh scream,    Nor vocalism of sun-bright Italy,    Nor German organ majestic, nor vast concourse of voices, nor layers        of harmonies,    Nor strophes of husbands and wives, nor sound of marching soldiers,    Nor flutes, nor harps, nor the bugle-calls of camps,    But to a new rhythmus fitted for thee,    Poems bridging the way from Life to Death, vaguely wafted in night        air, uncaught, unwritten,    Which let us go forth in the bold day and write.          BOOK XXVI      Passage to India           1    Singing my days,    Singing the great achievements of the present,    Singing the strong light works of engineers,    Our modern wonders, (the antique ponderous Seven outvied,)    In the Old World the east the Suez canal,    The New by its mighty railroad spann’d,    The seas inlaid with eloquent gentle wires;    Yet first to sound, and ever sound, the cry with thee O soul,    The Past! the Past! the Past!      The Past--the dark unfathom’d retrospect!    The teeming gulf--the sleepers and the shadows!    The past--the infinite greatness of the past!    For what is the present after all but a growth out of the past?    (As a projectile form’d, impell’d, passing a certain line, still keeps on,    So the present, utterly form’d, impell’d by the past.)           2    Passage O soul to India!    Eclaircise the myths Asiatic, the primitive fables.      Not you alone proud truths of the world,    Nor you alone ye facts of modern science,    But myths and fables of eld, Asia’s, Africa’s fables,    The far-darting beams of the spirit, the unloos’d dreams,    The deep diving bibles and legends,    The daring plots of the poets, the elder religions;    O you temples fairer than lilies pour’d over by the rising sun!    O you fables spurning the known, eluding the hold of the known,        mounting to heaven!    You lofty and dazzling towers, pinnacled, red as roses, burnish’d        with gold!    Towers of fables immortal fashion’d from mortal dreams!    You too I welcome and fully the same as the rest!    You too with joy I sing.      Passage to India!    Lo, soul, seest thou not God’s purpose from the first?    The earth to be spann’d, connected by network,    The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage,    The oceans to be cross’d, the distant brought near,    The lands to be welded together.      A worship new I sing,    You captains, voyagers, explorers, yours,    You engineers, you architects, machinists, yours,    You, not for trade or transportation only,    But in God’s name, and for thy sake O soul.           3    Passage to India!    Lo soul for thee of tableaus twain,    I see in one the Suez canal initiated, open’d,    I see the procession of steamships, the Empress Engenie’s leading the van,    I mark from on deck the strange landscape, the pure sky, the level        sand in the distance,    I pass swiftly the picturesque groups, the workmen gather’d,    The gigantic dredging machines.      In one again, different, (yet thine, all thine, O soul, the same,)    I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every barrier,    I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying        freight and passengers,    I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill steam-whistle,    I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world,    I cross the Laramie plains, I note the rocks in grotesque shapes,        the buttes,    I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions, the barren, colorless,        sage-deserts,    I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the great        mountains, I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch mountains,    I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle’s Nest, I pass the        Promontory, I ascend the Nevadas,    I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base,    I see the Humboldt range, I thread the valley and cross the river,    I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe, I see forests of majestic pines,    Or crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, I behold        enchanting mirages of waters and meadows,    Marking through these and after all, in duplicate slender lines,    Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel,    Tying the Eastern to the Western sea,    The road between Europe and Asia.      (Ah Genoese thy dream! thy dream!    Centuries after thou art laid in thy grave,    The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream.)           4    Passage to India!    Struggles of many a captain, tales of many a sailor dead,    Over my mood stealing and spreading they come,    Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach’d sky.      Along all history, down the slopes,    As a rivulet running, sinking now, and now again to the surface rising,    A ceaseless thought, a varied train--lo, soul, to thee, thy sight,        they rise,    The plans, the voyages again, the expeditions;    Again Vasco de Gama sails forth,    Again the knowledge gain’d, the mariner’s compass,    Lands found and nations born, thou born America,    For purpose vast, man’s long probation fill’d,    Thou rondure of the world at last accomplish’d.           5    O vast Rondure, swimming in space,    Cover’d all over with visible power and beauty,    Alternate light and day and the teeming spiritual darkness,    Unspeakable high processions of sun and moon and countless stars above,    Below, the manifold grass and waters, animals, mountains, trees,    With inscrutable purpose, some hidden prophetic intention,    Now first it seems my thought begins to span thee.      Down from the gardens of Asia descending radiating,    Adam and Eve appear, then their myriad progeny after them,    Wandering, yearning, curious, with restless explorations,    With questionings, baffled, formless, feverish, with never-happy hearts,    With that sad incessant refrain, Wherefore unsatisfied soul? and        Whither O mocking life?      Ah who shall soothe these feverish children?    Who Justify these restless explorations?    Who speak the secret of impassive earth?    Who bind it to us? what is this separate Nature so unnatural?    What is this earth to our affections? (unloving earth, without a        throb to answer ours,    Cold earth, the place of graves.)      Yet soul be sure the first intent remains, and shall be carried out,    Perhaps even now the time has arrived.      After the seas are all cross’d, (as they seem already cross’d,)    After the great captains and engineers have accomplish’d their work,    After the noble inventors, after the scientists, the chemist, the        geologist, ethnologist,    Finally shall come the poet worthy that name,    The true son of God shall come singing his songs.      Then not your deeds only O voyagers, O scientists and inventors,        shall be justified,    All these hearts as of fretted children shall be sooth’d,    All affection shall be fully responded to, the secret shall be told,    All these separations and gaps shall be taken up and hook’d and        link’d together,    The whole earth, this cold, impassive, voiceless earth, shall be        completely Justified,    Trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish’d and compacted by        the true son of God, the poet,    (He shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains,    He shall double the cape of Good Hope to some purpose,)    Nature and Man shall be disjoin’d and diffused no more,    The true son of God shall absolutely fuse them.           6    Year at whose wide-flung door I sing!    Year of the purpose accomplish’d!    Year of the marriage of continents, climates and oceans!    (No mere doge of Venice now wedding the Adriatic,)    I see O year in you the vast terraqueous globe given and giving all,    Europe to Asia, Africa join’d, and they to the New World,    The lands, geographies, dancing before you, holding a festival garland,    As brides and bridegrooms hand in hand.      Passage to India!    Cooling airs from Caucasus far, soothing cradle of man,    The river Euphrates flowing, the past lit up again.      Lo soul, the retrospect brought forward,    The old, most populous, wealthiest of earth’s lands,    The streams of the Indus and the Ganges and their many affluents,    (I my shores of America walking to-day behold, resuming all,)    The tale of Alexander on his warlike marches suddenly dying,    On one side China and on the other side Persia and Arabia,    To the south the great seas and the bay of Bengal,    The flowing literatures, tremendous epics, religions, castes,    Old occult Brahma interminably far back, the tender and junior Buddha,    Central and southern empires and all their belongings, possessors,    The wars of Tamerlane,the reign of Aurungzebe,    The traders, rulers, explorers, Moslems, Venetians, Byzantium, the        Arabs, Portuguese,    The first travelers famous yet, Marco Polo, Batouta the Moor,    Doubts to be solv’d, the map incognita, blanks to be fill’d,    The foot of man unstay’d, the hands never at rest,    Thyself O soul that will not brook a challenge.      The mediaeval navigators rise before me,    The world of 1492, with its awaken’d enterprise,    Something swelling in humanity now like the sap of the earth in spring,    The sunset splendor of chivalry declining.      And who art thou sad shade?    Gigantic, visionary, thyself a visionary,    With majestic limbs and pious beaming eyes,    Spreading around with every look of thine a golden world,    Enhuing it with gorgeous hues.      As the chief histrion,    Down to the footlights walks in some great scena,    Dominating the rest I see the Admiral himself,    (History’s type of courage, action, faith,)    Behold him sail from Palos leading his little fleet,    His voyage behold, his return, his great fame,    His misfortunes, calumniators, behold him a prisoner, chain’d,    Behold his dejection, poverty, death.      (Curious in time I stand, noting the efforts of heroes,    Is the deferment long? bitter the slander, poverty, death?    Lies the seed unreck’d for centuries in the ground? lo, to God’s due        occasion,    Uprising in the night, it sprouts, blooms,    And fills the earth with use and beauty.)           7    Passage indeed O soul to primal thought,    Not lands and seas alone, thy own clear freshness,    The young maturity of brood and bloom,    To realms of budding bibles.      O soul, repressless, I with thee and thou with me,    Thy circumnavigation of the world begin,    Of man, the voyage of his mind’s return,    To reason’s early paradise,    Back, back to wisdom’s birth, to innocent intuitions,    Again with fair creation.           8    O we can wait no longer,    We too take ship O soul,    Joyous we too launch out on trackless seas,    Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to sail,    Amid the wafting winds, (thou pressing me to thee, I thee to me, O soul,)    Caroling free, singing our song of God,    Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration.      With laugh and many a kiss,    (Let others deprecate, let others weep for sin, remorse, humiliation,)    O soul thou pleasest me, I thee.      Ah more than any priest O soul we too believe in God,    But with the mystery of God we dare not dally.      O soul thou pleasest me, I thee,    Sailing these seas or on the hills, or waking in the night,    Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time and Space and Death, like waters flowing,    Bear me indeed as through the regions infinite,    Whose air I breathe, whose ripples hear, lave me all over,    Bathe me O God in thee, mounting to thee,    I and my soul to range in range of thee.      O Thou transcendent,    Nameless, the fibre and the breath,    Light of the light, shedding forth universes, thou centre of them,    Thou mightier centre of the true, the good, the loving,    Thou moral, spiritual fountain--affection’s source--thou reservoir,    (O pensive soul of me--O thirst unsatisfied--waitest not there?    Waitest not haply for us somewhere there the Comrade perfect?)    Thou pulse--thou motive of the stars, suns, systems,    That, circling, move in order, safe, harmonious,    Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space,    How should I think, how breathe a single breath, how speak, if, out        of myself,    I could not launch, to those, superior universes?      Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God,    At Nature and its wonders, Time and Space and Death,    But that I, turning, call to thee O soul, thou actual Me,    And lo, thou gently masterest the orbs,    Thou matest Time, smilest content at Death,    And fillest, swellest full the vastnesses of Space.      Greater than stars or suns,    Bounding O soul thou journeyest forth;    What love than thine and ours could wider amplify?    What aspirations, wishes, outvie thine and ours O soul?    What dreams of the ideal? what plans of purity, perfection, strength?    What cheerful willingness for others’ sake to give up all?    For others’ sake to suffer all?      Reckoning ahead O soul, when thou, the time achiev’d,    The seas all cross’d, weather’d the capes, the voyage done,    Surrounded, copest, frontest God, yieldest, the aim attain’d,    As fill’d with friendship, love complete, the Elder Brother found,    The Younger melts in fondness in his arms.           9    Passage to more than India!    Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights?    O soul, voyagest thou indeed on voyages like those?    Disportest thou on waters such as those?    Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas?    Then have thy bent unleash’d.      Passage to you, your shores, ye aged fierce enigmas!    Passage to you, to mastership of you, ye strangling problems!    You, strew’d with the wrecks of skeletons, that, living, never reach’d you.      Passage to more than India!    O secret of the earth and sky!    Of you O waters of the sea! O winding creeks and rivers!    Of you O woods and fields! of you strong mountains of my land!    Of you O prairies! of you gray rocks!    O morning red! O clouds! O rain and snows!    O day and night, passage to you!        O sun and moon and all you stars! Sirius and Jupiter!    Passage to you!      Passage, immediate passage! the blood burns in my veins!    Away O soul! hoist instantly the anchor!      Cut the hawsers--haul out--shake out every sail!    Have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough?    Have we not grovel’d here long enough, eating and drinking like mere brutes?    Have we not darken’d and dazed ourselves with books long enough?      Sail forth--steer for the deep waters only,    Reckless O soul, exploring, I with thee, and thou with me,    For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go,    And we will risk the ship, ourselves and all.      O my brave soul!    O farther farther sail!    O daring joy, but safe! are they not all the seas of God?    O farther, farther, farther sail!          BOOK XXVII      Prayer of Columbus      A batter’d, wreck’d old man,    Thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home,    Pent by the sea and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary months,    Sore, stiff with many toils, sicken’d and nigh to death,    I take my way along the island’s edge,    Venting a heavy heart.      I am too full of woe!    Haply I may not live another day;    I cannot rest O God, I cannot eat or drink or sleep,    Till I put forth myself, my prayer, once more to Thee,    Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, commune with Thee,    Report myself once more to Thee.      Thou knowest my years entire, my life,    My long and crowded life of active work, not adoration merely;    Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth,    Thou knowest my manhood’s solemn and visionary meditations,    Thou knowest how before I commenced I devoted all to come to Thee,    Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows and strictly kept them,    Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in Thee,    In shackles, prison’d, in disgrace, repining not,    Accepting all from Thee, as duly come from Thee.      All my emprises have been fill’d with Thee,    My speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thoughts of Thee,    Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee;    Intentions, purports, aspirations mine, leaving results to Thee.      O I am sure they really came from Thee,    The urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will,    The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,    A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep,    These sped me on.      By me and these the work so far accomplish’d,    By me earth’s elder cloy’d and stifled lands uncloy’d, unloos’d,    By me the hemispheres rounded and tied, the unknown to the known.      The end I know not, it is all in Thee,    Or small or great I know not--haply what broad fields, what lands,    Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know,    Transplanted there may rise to stature, knowledge worthy Thee,    Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn’d to reaping-tools,    Haply the lifeless cross I know, Europe’s dead cross, may bud and        blossom there.      One effort more, my altar this bleak sand;    That Thou O God my life hast lighted,    With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of Thee,    Light rare untellable, lighting the very light,    Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages;    For that O God, be it my latest word, here on my knees,    Old, poor, and paralyzed, I thank Thee.      My terminus near,    The clouds already closing in upon me,    The voyage balk’d, the course disputed, lost,    I yield my ships to Thee.      My hands, my limbs grow nerveless,    My brain feels rack’d, bewilder’d,    Let the old timbers part, I will not part,    I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me,    Thee, Thee at least I know.      Is it the prophet’s thought I speak, or am I raving?    What do I know of life? what of myself?    I know not even my own work past or present,    Dim ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me,    Of newer better worlds, their mighty parturition,    Mocking, perplexing me.      And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?    As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal’d my eyes,    Shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky,    And on the distant waves sail countless ships,    And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.          BOOK XXVIII      The Sleepers           1    I wander all night in my vision,    Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping,    Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,    Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,    Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.      How solemn they look there, stretch’d and still,    How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.      The wretched features of ennuyes, the white features of corpses, the        livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists,    The gash’d bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their        strong-door’d rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging        from gates, and the dying emerging from gates,    The night pervades them and infolds them.      The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on        the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the husband,    The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,    The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,    And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt.      The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,    The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son sleeps,    The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?    And the murder’d person, how does he sleep?      The female that loves unrequited sleeps,    And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,    The head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,    And the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep.      I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering and        the most restless,    I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them,    The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.      Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear,    The earth recedes from me into the night,    I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is        beautiful.      I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other sleepers        each in turn,    I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,    And I become the other dreamers.      I am a dance--play up there! the fit is whirling me fast!      I am the ever-laughing--it is new moon and twilight,    I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever way look,    Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it is        neither ground nor sea.      Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,    Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,    I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,    And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,    To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch’d arms, and        resume the way;    Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting        music and wild-flapping pennants of joy!      I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,    The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,    He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after to-day,    The stammerer, the well-form’d person, the wasted or feeble person.      I am she who adorn’d herself and folded her hair expectantly,    My truant lover has come, and it is dark.      Double yourself and receive me darkness,    Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without him.      I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the dusk.      He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,    He rises with me silently from the bed.      Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and panting,    I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.      My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,    I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.      Be careful darkness! already what was it touch’d me?    I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,    I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away.           2    I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,    Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.      It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman’s,    I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson’s        stockings.      It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight,    I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.      A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin,    It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is        blank here, for reasons.      (It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy,    Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough.)           3    I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies        of the sea,    His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with        courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs,    I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,    I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on        the rocks.      What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?    Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime        of his middle age?      Steady and long he struggles,    He is baffled, bang’d, bruis’d, he holds out while his strength        holds out,    The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away,        they roll him, swing him, turn him,    His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is        continually bruis’d on rocks,    Swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse.           4    I turn but do not extricate myself,    Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.      The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,    The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts.      I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as        she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter.      I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,    I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.      I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash’d to us alive,    In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.           5    Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,    Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench’d        hills amid a crowd of officers.    His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,    He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch’d        from his cheeks,    He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by        their parents.      The same at last and at last when peace is declared,    He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov’d soldiers        all pass through,    The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,    The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek,    He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes hands        and bids good-by to the army.           6    Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together,    Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on        the old homestead.      A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,    On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,    Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop’d        her face,    Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as        she spoke.      My mother look’d in delight and amazement at the stranger,    She look’d at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and        pliant limbs,    The more she look’d upon her she loved her,    Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,    She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook’d        food for her,    She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.      The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the        afternoon she went away,    O my mother was loth to have her go away,    All the week she thought of her, she watch’d for her many a month,    She remember’d her many a winter and many a summer,    But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.           7    A show of the summer softness--a contact of something unseen--an        amour of the light and air,    I am jealous and overwhelm’d with friendliness,    And will go gallivant with the light and air myself.      O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me,    Autumn and winter are in the dreams, the farmer goes with his thrift,    The droves and crops increase, the barns are well-fill’d.      Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in the dreams,    The sailor sails, the exile returns home,    The fugitive returns unharm’d, the immigrant is back beyond months        and years,    The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood with        the well known neighbors and faces,    They warmly welcome him, he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well off,    The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage        home, and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home,    To every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill’d ships,    The Swiss foots it toward his hills, the Prussian goes his way, the        Hungarian his way, and the Pole his way,    The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.      The homeward bound and the outward bound,    The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuye, the onanist, the female that        loves unrequited, the money-maker,    The actor and actress, those through with their parts and those        waiting to commence,    The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee        that is chosen and the nominee that has fail’d,    The great already known and the great any time after to-day,    The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form’d, the homely,    The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced        him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience,    The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red squaw,    The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wrong’d,    The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,    I swear they are averaged now--one is no better than the other,    The night and sleep have liken’d them and restored them.      I swear they are all beautiful,    Every one that sleeps is beautiful, every thing in the dim light is        beautiful,    The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.      Peace is always beautiful,    The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.      The myth of heaven indicates the soul,    The soul is always beautiful, it appears more or it appears less, it        comes or it lags behind,    It comes from its embower’d garden and looks pleasantly on itself        and encloses the world,    Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting,and perfect and        clean the womb cohering,    The head well-grown proportion’d and plumb, and the bowels and        joints proportion’d and plumb.      The soul is always beautiful,    The universe is duly in order, every thing is in its place,    What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its place,    The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,    The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of        the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long,    The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced are to go on        in their turns, and the far behind are to come on in their turns,    The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite--        they unite now.           8    The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,    They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as        they lie unclothed,    The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the European and American        are hand in hand,    Learn’d and unlearn’d are hand in hand, and male and female are hand        in hand,    The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover, they        press close without lust, his lips press her neck,    The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with        measureless love, and the son holds the father in his arms with        measureless love,    The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter,    The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is        inarm’d by friend,    The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar,        the wrong ’d made right,    The call of the slave is one with the master’s call, and the master        salutes the slave,    The felon steps forth from the prison, the insane becomes sane, the        suffering of sick persons is reliev’d,    The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat that was unsound is sound,        the lungs of the consumptive are resumed, the poor distress’d        head is free,    The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother        than ever,    Stiflings and passages open, the paralyzed become supple,    The swell’d and convuls’d and congested awake to themselves in condition,    They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the        night, and awake.      I too pass from the night,    I stay a while away O night, but I return to you again and love you.      Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you?    I am not afraid, I have been well brought forward by you,    I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long,    I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with you, but        I know I came well and shall go well.      I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes,    I will duly pass the day O my mother, and duly return to you.          Transpositions      Let the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever        bawling--let an idiot or insane person appear on each of the stands;    Let judges and criminals be transposed--let the prison-keepers be        put in prison--let those that were prisoners take the keys;    Let them that distrust birth and death lead the rest.          BOOK XXIX      To Think of Time          1    To think of time--of all that retrospection,    To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward.      Have you guess’d you yourself would not continue?    Have you dreaded these earth-beetles?    Have you fear’d the future would be nothing to you?      Is to-day nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?    If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing.      To think that the sun rose in the east--that men and women were        flexible, real, alive--that every thing was alive,    To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part,    To think that we are now here and bear our part.           2    Not a day passes, not a minute or second without an accouchement,    Not a day passes, not a minute or second without a corpse.      The dull nights go over and the dull days also,    The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,    The physician after long putting off gives the silent and terrible        look for an answer,    The children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters        are sent for,    Medicines stand unused on the shelf, (the camphor-smell has long        pervaded the rooms,)    The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying,    The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,    The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,    The corpse stretches on the bed and the living look upon it,    It is palpable as the living are palpable.      The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,    But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously        on the corpse.           3    To think the thought of death merged in the thought of materials,    To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking        great interest in them, and we taking no interest in them.      To think how eager we are in building our houses,    To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent.      (I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or        seventy or eighty years at most,    I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)      Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth--they never        cease--they are the burial lines,    He that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall        surely be buried.            4    A reminiscence of the vulgar fate,    A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,    Each after his kind.      Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf, posh and ice in the river,        half-frozen mud in the streets,    A gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last daylight of December,    A hearse and stages, the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver,        the cortege mostly drivers.      Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell,    The gate is pass’d, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living        alight, the hearse uncloses,    The coffin is pass’d out, lower’d and settled, the whip is laid on        the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel’d in,    The mound above is flatted with the spades--silence,    A minute--no one moves or speaks--it is done,    He is decently put away--is there any thing more?      He was a good fellow, free-mouth’d, quick-temper’d, not bad-looking,    Ready with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate        hearty, drank hearty,    Had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward the        last, sicken’d, was help’d by a contribution,    Died, aged forty-one years--and that was his funeral.      Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap,        wet-weather clothes, whip carefully chosen,    Boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you        loafing on somebody, headway, man before and man behind,    Good day’s work, bad day’s work, pet stock, mean stock, first out,        last out, turning-in at night,    To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers, and he        there takes no interest in them.           5    The markets, the government, the working-man’s wages, to think what        account they are through our nights and days,    To think that other working-men will make just as great account of        them, yet we make little or no account.      The vulgar and the refined, what you call sin and what you call        goodness, to think how wide a difference,    To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie        beyond the difference.      To think how much pleasure there is,    Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or        planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and family?    Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the        beautiful maternal cares?    These also flow onward to others, you and I flow onward,    But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.      Your farm, profits, crops--to think how engross’d you are,    To think there will still be farms, profits, crops, yet for you of        what avail?           6    What will be will be well, for what is is well,    To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.      The domestic joys, the dally housework or business, the building of        houses, are not phantasms, they have weight, form, location,    Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them        phantasms,    The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,    The earth is not an echo, man and his life and all the things of his        life are well-consider’d.      You are not thrown to the winds, you gather certainly and safely        around yourself,    Yourself! yourself!. yourself, for ever and ever!           7    It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and        father, it is to identify you,    It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be decided,    Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form’d in you,    You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.      The threads that were spun are gather’d, the wet crosses the warp,        the pattern is systematic.      The preparations have every one been justified,    The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments, the baton        has given the signal.      The guest that was coming, he waited long, he is now housed,    He is one of those who are beautiful and happy, he is one of those        that to look upon and be with is enough.      The law of the past cannot be eluded,    The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,    The law of the living cannot be eluded, it is eternal,    The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,    The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,    The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons, not one iota thereof        can be eluded.           8    Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,    Northerner goes carried and Southerner goes carried, and they on the        Atlantic side and they on the Pacific,    And they between, and all through the Mississippi country, and all        over the earth.      The great masters and kosmos are well as they go, the heroes and        good-doers are well,    The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and pious and        distinguish’d may be well,    But there is more account than that, there is strict account of all.      The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,    The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,    The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go.      Of and in all these things,    I have dream’d that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of        us changed,    I have dream’d that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present        and past law,    And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and        past law,    For I have dream’d that the law they are under now is enough.      And I have dream’d that the purpose and essence of the known life,        the transient,    Is to form and decide identity for the unknown life, the permanent.      If all came but to ashes of dung,    If maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are betray’d,    Then indeed suspicion of death.      Do you suspect death? if I were to suspect death I should die now,    Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation?      Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,    Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,    The whole universe indicates that it is good,    The past and the present indicate that it is good.      How beautiful and perfect are the animals!    How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!    What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,    The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable        fluids perfect;    Slowly and surely they have pass’d on to this, and slowly and surely        they yet pass on.           9    I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an eternal soul!    The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! the        animals!      I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!    That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for        it, and the cohering is for it!    And all preparation is for it--and identity is for it--and life and        materials are altogether for it!          BOOK XXX.  WHISPERS OF HEAVENLY DEATH      Darest Thou Now O Soul      Darest thou now O soul,    Walk out with me toward the unknown region,    Where neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow?      No map there, nor guide,    Nor voice sounding, nor touch of human hand,    Nor face with blooming flesh, nor lips, nor eyes, are in that land.      I know it not O soul,    Nor dost thou, all is a blank before us,    All waits undream’d of in that region, that inaccessible land.      Till when the ties loosen,    All but the ties eternal, Time and Space,    Nor darkness, gravitation, sense, nor any bounds bounding us.      Then we burst forth, we float,    In Time and Space O soul, prepared for them,    Equal, equipt at last, (O joy! O fruit of all!) them to fulfil O soul.          Whispers of Heavenly Death      Whispers of heavenly death murmur’d I hear,    Labial gossip of night, sibilant chorals,    Footsteps gently ascending, mystical breezes wafted soft and low,    Ripples of unseen rivers, tides of a current flowing, forever flowing,    (Or is it the plashing of tears? the measureless waters of human tears?)      I see, just see skyward, great cloud-masses,    Mournfully slowly they roll, silently swelling and mixing,    With at times a half-dimm’d sadden’d far-off star,    Appearing and disappearing.      (Some parturition rather, some solemn immortal birth;    On the frontiers to eyes impenetrable,    Some soul is passing over.)          Chanting the Square Deific           1    Chanting the square deific, out of the One advancing, out of the sides,    Out of the old and new, out of the square entirely divine,    Solid, four-sided, (all the sides needed,) from this side Jehovah am I,    Old Brahm I, and I Saturnius am;    Not Time affects me--I am Time, old, modern as any,    Unpersuadable, relentless, executing righteous judgments,    As the Earth, the Father, the brown old Kronos, with laws,    Aged beyond computation, yet never new, ever with those mighty laws rolling,    Relentless I forgive no man--whoever sins dies--I will have that man’s life;    Therefore let none expect mercy--have the seasons, gravitation, the        appointed days, mercy? no more have I,    But as the seasons and gravitation, and as all the appointed days        that forgive not,    I dispense from this side judgments inexorable without the least remorse.           2    Consolator most mild, the promis’d one advancing,    With gentle hand extended, the mightier God am I,    Foretold by prophets and poets in their most rapt prophecies and poems,    From this side, lo! the Lord Christ gazes--lo! Hermes I--lo! mine is        Hercules’ face,    All sorrow, labor, suffering, I, tallying it, absorb in myself,    Many times have I been rejected, taunted, put in prison, and        crucified, and many times shall be again,    All the world have I given up for my dear brothers’ and sisters’        sake, for the soul’s sake,    Wanding my way through the homes of men, rich or poor, with the kiss        of affection,    For I am affection, I am the cheer-bringing God, with hope and        all-enclosing charity,    With indulgent words as to children, with fresh and sane words, mine only,    Young and strong I pass knowing well I am destin’d myself to an        early death;    But my charity has no death--my wisdom dies not, neither early nor late,    And my sweet love bequeath’d here and elsewhere never dies.           3    Aloof, dissatisfied, plotting revolt,    Comrade of criminals, brother of slaves,    Crafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,    With sudra face and worn brow, black, but in the depths of my heart,        proud as any,    Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to rule me,    Morose, full of guile, full of reminiscences, brooding, with many wiles,    (Though it was thought I was baffled, and dispel’d, and my wiles        done, but that will never be,)    Defiant, I, Satan, still live, still utter words, in new lands duly        appearing, (and old ones also,)    Permanent here from my side, warlike, equal with any, real as any,    Nor time nor change shall ever change me or my words.           4    Santa Spirita, breather, life,    Beyond the light, lighter than light,    Beyond the flames of hell, joyous, leaping easily above hell,    Beyond Paradise, perfumed solely with mine own perfume,    Including all life on earth, touching, including God, including        Saviour and Satan,    Ethereal, pervading all, (for without me what were all? what were God?)    Essence of forms, life of the real identities, permanent, positive,        (namely the unseen,)    Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man, I, the        general soul,    Here the square finishing, the solid, I the most solid,    Breathe my breath also through these songs.          Of Him I Love Day and Night      Of him I love day and night I dream’d I heard he was dead,    And I dream’d I went where they had buried him I love, but he was        not in that place,    And I dream’d I wander’d searching among burial-places to find him,    And I found that every place was a burial-place;    The houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is now,)    The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the Chicago,        Boston, Philadelphia, the Mannahatta, were as full of the dead as        of the living,    And fuller, O vastly fuller of the dead than of the living;    And what I dream’d I will henceforth tell to every person and age,    And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream’d,    And now I am willing to disregard burial-places and dispense with them,    And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere,        even in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be satisfied,    And if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own corpse, be duly        render’d to powder and pour’d in the sea, I shall be satisfied,    Or if it be distributed to the winds I shall be satisfied.          Yet, Yet, Ye Downcast Hours      Yet, yet, ye downcast hours, I know ye also,    Weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at my ankles,    Earth to a chamber of mourning turns--I hear the o’erweening, mocking        voice,    Matter is conqueror--matter, triumphant only, continues onward.      Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me,    The call of my nearest lover, putting forth, alarm’d, uncertain,    The sea I am quickly to sail, come tell me,    Come tell me where I am speeding, tell me my destination.      I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you,    I approach, hear, behold, the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes,        your mute inquiry,    Whither I go from the bed I recline on, come tell me,--    Old age, alarm’d, uncertain--a young woman’s voice, appealing to        me for comfort;    A young man’s voice, Shall I not escape?          As If a Phantom Caress’d Me      As if a phantom caress’d me,    I thought I was not alone walking here by the shore;    But the one I thought was with me as now I walk by the shore, the        one I loved that caress’d me,    As I lean and look through the glimmering light, that one has        utterly disappear’d.    And those appear that are hateful to me and mock me.          Assurances      I need no assurances, I am a man who is preoccupied of his own soul;    I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and        face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I am not cognizant        of, calm and actual faces,    I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in        any iota of the world,    I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are limitless,        in vain I try to think how limitless,    I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their        swift sports through the air on purpose, and that I shall one day        be eligible to do as much as they, and more than they,    I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of years,    I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have        their exteriors, and that the eyesight has another eyesight, and        the hearing another hearing, and the voice another voice,    I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young men are        provided for, and that the deaths of young women and the        deaths of little children are provided for,    (Did you think Life was so well provided for, and Death, the purport        of all Life, is not well provided for?)    I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what the horrors of        them, no matter whose wife, child, husband, father, lover, has        gone down, are provided for, to the minutest points,    I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any        time, is provided for in the inherences of things,    I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space, but I        believe Heavenly Death provides for all.          Quicksand Years      Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither,    Your schemes, politics, fail, lines give way, substances mock and elude me,    Only the theme I sing, the great and strong-possess’d soul, eludes not,    One’s-self must never give way--that is the final substance--that        out of all is sure,    Out of politics, triumphs, battles, life, what at last finally remains?    When shows break up what but One’s-Self is sure?          That Music Always Round Me      That music always round me, unceasing, unbeginning, yet long        untaught I did not hear,    But now the chorus I hear and am elated,    A tenor, strong, ascending with power and health, with glad notes of        daybreak I hear,    A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves,    A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe,    The triumphant tutti, the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and        violins, all these I fill myself with,    I hear not the volumes of sound merely, I am moved by the exquisite        meanings,    I listen to the different voices winding in and out, striving,        contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion;    I do not think the performers know themselves--but now I think        begin to know them.          What Ship Puzzled at Sea      What ship puzzled at sea, cons for the true reckoning?    Or coming in, to avoid the bars and follow the channel a perfect        pilot needs?    Here, sailor! here, ship! take aboard the most perfect pilot,    Whom, in a little boat, putting off and rowing, I hailing you offer.          A Noiseless Patient Spider      A noiseless patient spider,    I mark’d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,    Mark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,    It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament out of itself,    Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.      And you O my soul where you stand,    Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,    Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to        connect them,    Till the bridge you will need be form’d, till the ductile anchor hold,    Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.          O Living Always, Always Dying      O living always, always dying!    O the burials of me past and present,    O me while I stride ahead, material, visible, imperious as ever;    O me, what I was for years, now dead, (I lament not, I am content;)    O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I turn and        look at where I cast them,    To pass on, (O living! always living!) and leave the corpses behind.          To One Shortly to Die      From all the rest I single out you, having a message for you,    You are to die--let others tell you what they please, I cannot prevaricate,    I am exact and merciless, but I love you--there is no escape for you.      Softly I lay my right hand upon you, you ’ust feel it,    I do not argue, I bend my head close and half envelop it,    I sit quietly by, I remain faithful,    I am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbor,    I absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily, that is        eternal, you yourself will surely escape,    The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.      The sun bursts through in unlooked-for directions,    Strong thoughts fill you and confidence, you smile,    You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick,    You do not see the medicines, you do not mind the weeping friends,        I am with you,    I exclude others from you, there is nothing to be commiserated,    I do not commiserate, I congratulate you.          Night on the Prairies      Night on the prairies,    The supper is over, the fire on the ground burns low,    The wearied emigrants sleep, wrapt in their blankets;    I walk by myself--I stand and look at the stars, which I think now        never realized before.      Now I absorb immortality and peace,    I admire death and test propositions.      How plenteous! how spiritual! how resume!    The same old man and soul--the same old aspirations, and the same content.      I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the not-day exhibited,    I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless        around me myriads of other globes.      Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will        measure myself by them,    And now touch’d with the lives of other globes arrived as far along        as those of the earth,    Or waiting to arrive, or pass’d on farther than those of the earth,    I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,    Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive.      O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me, as the day cannot,    I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.          Thought      As I sit with others at a great feast, suddenly while the music is playing,    To my mind, (whence it comes I know not,) spectral in mist of a        wreck at sea,    Of certain ships, how they sail from port with flying streamers and        wafted kisses, and that is the last of them,    Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President,    Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder’d        off the Northeast coast and going down--of the steamship Arctic        going down,    Of the veil’d tableau-women gather’d together on deck, pale, heroic,        waiting the moment that draws so close--O the moment!      A huge sob--a few bubbles--the white foam spirting up--and then the        women gone,    Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on--and I now        pondering, Are those women indeed gone?    Are souls drown’d and destroy’d so?    Is only matter triumphant?          The Last Invocation      At the last, tenderly,    From the walls of the powerful fortress’d house,    From the clasp of the knitted locks, from the keep of the well-closed doors,    Let me be wafted.      Let me glide noiselessly forth;    With the key of softness unlock the locks--with a whisper,    Set ope the doors O soul.      Tenderly--be not impatient,    (Strong is your hold O mortal flesh,    Strong is your hold O love.)          As I Watch the Ploughman Ploughing      As I watch’d the ploughman ploughing,    Or the sower sowing in the fields, or the harvester harvesting,    I saw there too, O life and death, your analogies;    (Life, life is the tillage, and Death is the harvest according.)          Pensive and Faltering      Pensive and faltering,    The words the Dead I write,    For living are the Dead,    (Haply the only living, only real,    And I the apparition, I the spectre.)          BOOK XXXI      Thou Mother with Thy Equal Brood           1    Thou Mother with thy equal brood,    Thou varied chain of different States, yet one identity only,    A special song before I go I’d sing o’er all the rest,    For thee, the future.      I’d sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,    I’d fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,    I’d show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be accomplish’d.      The paths to the house I seek to make,    But leave to those to come the house itself.      Belief I sing, and preparation;    As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only,    But greater still from what is yet to come,    Out of that formula for thee I sing.           2    As a strong bird on pinions free,    Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,    Such be the thought I’d think of thee America,    Such be the recitative I’d bring for thee.      The conceits of the poets of other lands I’d bring thee not,    Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,    Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or indoor        library;    But an odor I’d bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or breath of        an Illinois prairie,    With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from Texas        uplands, or Florida’s glades,    Or the Saguenay’s black stream, or the wide blue spread of Huron,    With presentment of Yellowstone’s scenes, or Yosemite,    And murmuring under, pervading all, I’d bring the rustling sea-sound,    That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.      And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,    Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mind-formulas fitted        for thee, real and sane and large as these and thee,    Thou! mounting higher, diving deeper than we knew, thou        transcendental Union!    By thee fact to be justified, blended with thought,    Thought of man justified, blended with God,    Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality!    Through thy reality, lo, the immortal idea!           3    Brain of the New World, what a task is thine,    To formulate the Modern--out of the peerless grandeur of the modern,    Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches, art,    (Recast, may-be discard them, end them--maybe their work is done,        who knows?)    By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the mighty past, the dead,    To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present.      And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old World brain,    Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long,    Thou carefully prepared by it so long--haply thou but unfoldest it,        only maturest it,    It to eventuate in thee--the essence of the by-gone time contain’d in thee,    Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined with        reference to thee;    Thou but the apples, long, long, long a-growing,    The fruit of all the Old ripening to-day in thee.           4    Sail, sail thy best, ship of Democracy,    Of value is thy freight, ’tis not the Present only,    The Past is also stored in thee,    Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not of the Western        continent alone,    Earth’s resume entire floats on thy keel O ship, is steadied by thy spars,    With thee Time voyages in trust, the antecedent nations sink or        swim with thee,    With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou        bear’st the other continents,    Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port triumphant;    Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye O helmsman, thou        carriest great companions,    Venerable priestly Asia sails this day with thee,    And royal feudal Europe sails with thee.           5    Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,    Like a limitless golden cloud filling the westernr sky,    Emblem of general maternity lifted above all,    Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons,    Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless procession issuing,    Acceding from such gestation, taking and giving continual strength        and life,    World of the real--world of the twain in one,    World of the soul, born by the world of the real alone, led to        identity, body, by it alone,    Yet in beginning only, incalculable masses of composite precious materials,    By history’s cycles forwarded, by every nation, language, hither sent,    Ready, collected here, a freer, vast, electric world, to be        constructed here,    (The true New World, the world of orbic science, morals, literatures        to come,)    Thou wonder world yet undefined, unform’d, neither do I define thee,    How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future?    I feel thy ominous greatness evil as well as good,    I watch thee advancing, absorbing the present, transcending the past,    I see thy light lighting, and thy shadow shadowing, as if the entire globe,    But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly to comprehend thee,    I but thee name, thee prophesy, as now,    I merely thee ejaculate!      Thee in thy future,    Thee in thy only permanent life, career, thy own unloosen’d mind,        thy soaring spirit,    Thee as another equally needed sun, radiant, ablaze, swift-moving,        fructifying all,    Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and joy, in endless great hilarity,    Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long, that weigh’d so        long upon the mind of man,    The doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain decadence of man;    Thee in thy larger, saner brood of female, male--thee in thy        athletes, moral, spiritual, South, North, West, East,    (To thy immortal breasts, Mother of All, thy every daughter, son,        endear’d alike, forever equal,)    Thee in thy own musicians, singers, artists, unborn yet, but certain,    Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization, (until which thy proudest        material civilization must remain in vain,)    Thee in thy all-supplying, all-enclosing worship--thee in no single        bible, saviour, merely,    Thy saviours countless, latent within thyself, thy bibles incessant        within thyself, equal to any, divine as any,    (Thy soaring course thee formulating, not in thy two great wars, nor        in thy century’s visible growth,    But far more in these leaves and chants, thy chants, great Mother!)    Thee in an education grown of thee, in teachers, studies, students,        born of thee,    Thee in thy democratic fetes en-masse, thy high original festivals,        operas, lecturers, preachers,    Thee in thy ultimate, (the preparations only now completed, the        edifice on sure foundations tied,)    Thee in thy pinnacles, intellect, thought, thy topmost rational        joys, thy love and godlike aspiration,    In thy resplendent coming literati, thy full-lung’d orators, thy        sacerdotal bards, kosmic savans,    These! these in thee, (certain to come,) to-day I prophesy.           6    Land tolerating all, accepting all, not for the good alone, all good        for thee,    Land in the realms of God to be a realm unto thyself,    Under the rule of God to be a rule unto thyself.      (Lo, where arise three peerless stars,    To be thy natal stars my country, Ensemble, Evolution, Freedom,    Set in the sky of Law.)      Land of unprecedented faith, God’s faith,    Thy soil, thy very subsoil, all upheav’d,    The general inner earth so long so sedulously draped over, now hence        for what it is boldly laid bare,    Open’d by thee to heaven’s light for benefit or bale.      Not for success alone,    Not to fair-sail unintermitted always,    The storm shall dash thy face, the murk of war and worse than war        shall cover thee all over,    (Wert capable of war, its tug and trials? be capable of peace, its trials,    For the tug and mortal strain of nations come at last in prosperous        peace, not war;)    In many a smiling mask death shall approach beguiling thee, thou in        disease shalt swelter,    The livid cancer spread its hideous claws, clinging upon thy        breasts, seeking to strike thee deep within,    Consumption of the worst, moral consumption, shall rouge thy face        with hectic,    But thou shalt face thy fortunes, thy diseases, and surmount them all,    Whatever they are to-day and whatever through time they may be,    They each and all shall lift and pass away and cease from thee,    While thou, Time’s spirals rounding, out of thyself, thyself still        extricating, fusing,    Equable, natural, mystical Union thou, (the mortal with immortal blent,)    Shalt soar toward the fulfilment of the future, the spirit of the        body and the mind,    The soul, its destinies.      The soul, its destinies, the real real,    (Purport of all these apparitions of the real;)    In thee America, the soul, its destinies,    Thou globe of globes! thou wonder nebulous!    By many a throe of heat and cold convuls’d, (by these thyself solidifying,)    Thou mental, moral orb--thou New, indeed new, Spiritual World!    The Present holds thee not--for such vast growth as thine,    For such unparallel’d flight as thine, such brood as thine,    The FUTURE only holds thee and can hold thee.

BOOK XXXII.  FROM NOON TO STARRY NIGHT      Thou Orb Aloft Full-Dazzling      Thou orb aloft full-dazzling! thou hot October noon!    Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand,    The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam,    And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue;    O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.      Hear me illustrious!    Thy lover me, for always I have loved thee,    Even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood edge, thy        touching-distant beams enough,    Or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation.      (Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive,    I know before the fitting man all Nature yields,    Though answering not in words, the skies, trees, hear his voice--and        thou O sun,    As for thy throes, thy perturbations, sudden breaks and shafts of        flame gigantic,    I understand them, I know those flames, those perturbations well.)      Thou that with fructifying heat and light,    O’er myriad farms, o’er lands and waters North and South,    O’er Mississippi’s endless course, o’er Texas’ grassy plains,        Kanada’s woods,    O’er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space,    Thou that impartially enfoldest all, not only continents, seas,    Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally,    Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting ray out of        thy million millions,    Strike through these chants.      Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these,    Prepare the later afternoon of me myself--prepare my lengthening shadows,    Prepare my starry nights.          Faces           1    Sauntering the pavement or riding the country by-road, faces!    Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality,    The spiritual-prescient face, the always welcome common benevolent face,    The face of the singing of music, the grand faces of natural lawyers        and judges broad at the back-top,    The faces of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows, the shaved        blanch’d faces of orthodox citizens,    The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist’s face,    The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the handsome detested or        despised face,    The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the mother of        many children,    The face of an amour, the face of veneration,    The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock,    The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated face,    A wild hawk, his wings clipp’d by the clipper,    A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the gelder.      Sauntering the pavement thus, or crossing the ceaseless ferry, faces        and faces and faces,    I see them and complain not, and am content with all.           2    Do you suppose I could be content with all if I thought them their        own finale?      This now is too lamentable a face for a man,    Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing for it,    Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig to its hole.      This face is a dog’s snout sniffing for garbage,    Snakes nest in that mouth, I hear the sibilant threat.      This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea,    Its sleepy and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go.

17,Elizabeth and her German Gardenr,"up sweet odours as she works.      December 7th.--I have been to England. I went for at least a month and  stayed a week in a fog and was blown home again in a gale. Twice I fled  before the fogs into the country to see friends with gardens, but it  was raining, and except the beautiful lawns (not to be had in the  Fatherland) and the infinite possibilities, there was nothing to  interest the intelligent and garden-loving foreigner, for the good  reason that you cannot be interested in gardens under an umbrella. So I  went back to the fogs, and after groping about for a few days more began  to long inordinately for Germany. A terrific gale sprang up after I had  started, and the journey both by sea and land was full of horrors, the  trains in Germany being heated to such an extent that it is next to  impossible to sit still, great gusts of hot air coming up under the  cushions, the cushions themselves being very hot, and the wretched  traveller still hotter.    But when I reached my home and got out of the train into the purest,  brightest snow-atmosphere, the air so still that the whole world seemed  to be listening, the sky cloudless, the crisp snow sparkling underfoot  and on the trees, and a happy row of three beaming babies awaiting me, I  was consoled for all my torments, only remembering them enough to wonder  why I had gone away at all.    The babies each had a kitten in one hand and an elegant bouquet of pine  needles and grass in the other, and what with the due presentation of  the bouquets and the struggles of the kittens, the hugging and kissing  was much interfered with. Kittens, bouquets, and babies were all somehow  squeezed into the sleigh, and off we went with jingling bells and  shrieks of delight. “Directly you comes home the fun begins,” said the  May baby, sitting very close to me. “How the snow purrs!” cried the  April baby, as the horses scrunched it up with their feet. The June baby  sat loudly singing “The King of Love my Shepherd is,” and swinging her  kitten round by its tail to emphasise the rhythm.    The house, half-buried in the snow, looked the very abode of peace, and  I ran through all the rooms, eager to take possession of them again, and  feeling as though I had been away for ever. When I got to the library I  came to a standstill,--ah, the dear room, what happy times I have spent  in it rummaging amongst the books, making plans for my garden, building  castles in the air, writing, dreaming, doing nothing! There was a big  peat fire blazing half up the chimney, and the old housekeeper had put  pots of flowers about, and on the writing-table was a great bunch of  violets scenting the room. “Oh, how good it is to be home again!” I  sighed in my satisfaction. The babies clung about my knees, looking up  at me with eyes full of love. Outside the dazzling snow and sunshine,  inside the bright room and happy faces--I thought of those yellow fogs  and shivered. The library is not used by the Man of Wrath; it is neutral  ground where we meet in the evenings for an hour before he disappears  into his own rooms--a series of very smoky dens in the southeast  corner of the house. It looks, I am afraid, rather too gay for an ideal  library; and its colouring, white and yellow, is so cheerful as to be  almost frivolous. There are white bookcases all round the walls, and  there is a great fireplace, and four windows, facing full south, opening  on to my most cherished bit of garden, the bit round the sun-dial; so  that with so much colour and such a big fire and such floods of sunshine  it has anything but a sober air, in spite of the venerable volumes  filling the shelves. Indeed, I should never be surprised if they skipped  down from their places, and, picking up their leaves, began to dance.    With this room to live in, I can look forward with perfect equanimity  to being snowed up for any time Providence thinks proper; and to go into  the garden in its snowed-up state is like going into a bath of purity.  The first breath on opening the door is so ineffably pure that it makes  me gasp, and I feel a black and sinful object in the midst of all the  spotlessness. Yesterday I sat out of doors near the sun-dial the whole  afternoon, with the thermometer so many degrees below freezing that  it will be weeks finding its way up again; but there was no wind, and  beautiful sunshine, and I was well wrapped up in furs. I even had tea  brought out there, to the astonishment of the menials, and sat till long  after the sun had set, enjoying the frosty air. I had to drink the tea  very quickly, for it showed a strong inclination to begin to freeze.  After the sun had gone down the rooks came home to their nests in  the garden with a great fuss and fluttering, and many hesitations and  squabbles before they settled on their respective trees. They flew over  my head in hundreds with a mighty swish of wings, and when they had  arranged themselves comfortably, an intense hush fell upon the garden,  and the house began to look like a Christmas card, with its white roof  against the clear, pale green of the western sky, and lamplight shining  in the windows.    I had been reading a Life of Luther, lent me by our parson, in the  intervals between looking round me and being happy. He came one day with  the book and begged me to read it, having discovered that my interest  in Luther was not as living as it ought to be; so I took it out with  me into the garden, because the dullest book takes on a certain saving  grace if read out of doors, just as bread and butter, devoid of charm in  the drawing-room, is ambrosia eaten under a tree. I read Luther all the  afternoon with pauses for refreshing glances at the garden and the sky,  and much thankfulness in my heart. His struggles with devils amazed  me; and I wondered whether such a day as that, full of grace and the  forgiveness of sins, never struck him as something to make him relent  even towards devils. He apparently never allowed himself just to be  happy. He was a wonderful man, but I am glad I was not his wife.    Our parson is an interesting person, and untiring in his efforts to  improve himself. Both he and his wife study whenever they have a spare  moment, and there is a tradition that she stirs her puddings with one  hand and holds a Latin grammar in the other, the grammar, of course,  getting the greater share of her attention. To most German Hausfraus  the dinners and the puddings are of paramount importance, and they pride  themselves on keeping those parts of their houses that are seen in a  state of perpetual and spotless perfection, and this is exceedingly  praiseworthy; but, I would humbly inquire, are there not other things  even more important? And is not plain living and high thinking better  than the other way about? And all too careful making of dinners and  dusting of furniture takes a terrible amount of precious time, and--and  with shame I confess that my sympathies are all with the pudding and the  grammar. It cannot be right to be the slave of one’s household gods, and  I protest that if my furniture ever annoyed me by wanting to be dusted  when I wanted to be doing something else, and there was no one to do the  dusting for me, I would cast it all into the nearest bonfire and sit and  warm my toes at the flames with great contentment, triumphantly selling  my dusters to the very next pedlar who was weak enough to buy them.  Parsons’ wives have to do the housework and cooking themselves, and are  thus not only cooks and housemaids, but if they have children--and they  always do have children--they are head and under nurse as well; and  besides these trifling duties have a good deal to do with their fruit  and vegetable garden, and everything to do with their poultry. This  being so, is it not pathetic to find a young woman bravely struggling  to learn languages and keep up with her husband? If I were that husband,  those puddings would taste sweetest to me that were served with Latin  sauce. They are both severely pious, and are for ever engaged in  desperate efforts to practise what they preach; than which, as we all  know, nothing is more difficult. He works in his parish with the most  noble self-devotion, and never loses courage, although his efforts  have been several times rewarded by disgusting libels pasted up on the  street-corners, thrown under doors, and even fastened to his own garden  wall. The peasant hereabouts is past belief low and animal, and a  sensitive, intellectual parson among them is really a pearl before  swine. For years he has gone on unflinchingly, filled with the most  living faith and hope and charity, and I sometimes wonder whether they  are any better now in his parish than they were under his predecessor,  a man who smoked and drank beer from Monday morning to Saturday night,  never did a stroke of work, and often kept the scanty congregation  waiting on Sunday afternoons while he finished his postprandial nap. It  is discouraging enough to make most men give in, and leave the parish to  get to heaven or not as it pleases; but he never seems discouraged, and  goes on sacrificing the best part of his life to these people when all  his tastes are literary, and all his inclinations towards the life of  the student. His convictions drag him out of his little home at all  hours to minister to the sick and exhort the wicked; they give him no  rest, and never let him feel he has done enough; and when he comes  home weary, after a day’s wrestling with his parishioners’ souls, he is  confronted on his doorstep by filthy abuse pasted up on his own front  door. He never speaks of these things, but how shall they be hid?  Everybody here knows everything that happens before the day is over, and  what we have for dinner is of far greater general interest than the most  astounding political earthquake. They have a pretty, roomy cottage, and  a good bit of ground adjoining the churchyard. His predecessor used to  hang out his washing on the tombstones to dry, but then he was a person  entirely lost to all sense of decency, and had finally to be removed,  preaching a farewell sermon of a most vituperative description, and  hurling invective at the Man of Wrath, who sat up in his box drinking  in every word and enjoying himself thoroughly. The Man of Wrath likes  novelty, and such a sermon had never been heard before. It is spoken of  in the village to this day with bated breath and awful joy.      December 22nd.--Up to now we have had a beautiful winter. Clear skies,  frost, little wind, and, except for a sharp touch now and then, very few  really cold days. My windows are gay with hyacinths and lilies of  the valley; and though, as I have said, I don’t admire the smell of  hyacinths in the spring when it seems wanting in youth and chastity next  to that of other flowers, I am glad enough now to bury my nose in  their heavy sweetness. In December one cannot afford to be fastidious;  besides, one is actually less fastidious about everything in the winter.  The keen air braces soul as well as body into robustness, and the food  and the perfume disliked in the summer are perfectly welcome then.    I am very busy preparing for Christmas, but have often locked myself up  in a room alone, shutting out my unfinished duties, to study the flower  catalogues and make my lists of seeds and shrubs and trees for the  spring. It is a fascinating occupation, and acquires an additional charm  when you know you ought to be doing something else, that Christmas is  at the door, that children and servants and farm hands depend on you  for their pleasure, and that, if you don’t see to the decoration of the  trees and house, and the buying of the presents, nobody else will. The  hours fly by shut up with those catalogues and with Duty snarling on  the other side of the door. I don’t like Duty--everything in the least  disagreeable is always sure to be one’s duty. Why cannot it be my duty  to make lists and plans for the dear garden? “And so it is,” I insisted  to the Man of Wrath, when he protested against what he called wasting my  time upstairs. “No,” he replied sagely; “your garden is not your duty,  because it is your Pleasure.”    What a comfort it is to have such wells of wisdom constantly at my  disposal! Anybody can have a husband, but to few is it given to have a  sage, and the combination of both is as rare as it is useful. Indeed, in  its practical utility the only thing I ever saw to equal it is a sofa my  neighbour has bought as a Christmas surprise for her husband, and which  she showed me the last time I called there--a beautiful invention, as  she explained, combining a bedstead, a sofa, and a chest of drawers, and  into which you put your clothes, and on top of which you put yourself,  and if anybody calls in the middle of the night and you happen to be  using the drawing-room as a bedroom, you just pop the bedclothes inside,  and there you are discovered sitting on your sofa and looking for all  the world as though you had been expecting visitors for hours.    “Pray, does he wear pyjamas?” I inquired.    But she had never heard of pyjamas.    It takes a long time to make my spring lists. I want to have a border  all yellow, every shade of yellow from fieriest orange to nearly white,  and the amount of work and studying of gardening books it costs me will  only be appreciated by beginners like myself. I have been weeks planning  it, and it is not nearly finished. I want it to be a succession of  glories from May till the frosts, and the chief feature is to be the  number of “ardent marigolds”--flowers that I very tenderly love--and  nasturtiums. The nasturtiums are to be of every sort and shade, and are  to climb and creep and grow in bushes, and show their lovely flowers  and leaves to the best advantage. Then there are to be eschscholtzias,  dahlias, sunflowers, zinnias, scabiosa, portulaca, yellow violas, yellow  stocks, yellow sweet-peas, yellow lupins--everything that is yellow or  that has a yellow variety. The place I have chosen for it is a long,  wide border in the sun, at the foot of a grassy slope crowned with  lilacs and pines, and facing southeast. You go through a little pine  wood, and, turning a corner, are to come suddenly upon this bit of  captured morning glory. I want it to be blinding in its brightness after  the dark, cool path through the wood.    That is the idea. Depression seizes me when I reflect upon the probable  difference between the idea and its realisation. I am ignorant, and  the gardener is, I do believe, still more so; for he was forcing some  tulips, and they have all shrivelled up and died, and he says he cannot  imagine why. Besides, he is in love with the cook, and is going to marry  her after Christmas, and refuses to enter into any of my plans with the  enthusiasm they deserve, but sits with vacant eye dreamily chopping  wood from morning till night to keep the beloved one’s kitchen fire well  supplied. I cannot understand any one preferring cooks to marigolds;  those future marigolds, shadowy as they are, and whose seeds are still  sleeping at the seedsman’s, have shone through my winter days like  golden lamps.    I wish with all my heart I were a man, for of course the first thing I  should do would be to buy a spade and go and garden, and then I should  have the delight of doing everything for my flowers with my own hands  and need not waste time explaining what I want done to somebody else. It  is dull work giving orders and trying to describe the bright visions of  one’s brain to a person who has no visions and no brain, and who thinks  a yellow bed should be calceolarias edged with blue.    I have taken care in choosing my yellow plants to put down only those  humble ones that are easily pleased and grateful for little, for my soil  is by no means all that it might be, and to most plants the climate is  rather trying. I feel really grateful to any flower that is sturdy and  willing enough to flourish here. Pansies seem to like the place and  so do sweet-peas; pinks don’t, and after much coaxing gave hardly any  flowers last summer. Nearly all the roses were a success, in spite of  the sandy soil, except the tea-rose Adam, which was covered with buds  ready to open, when they suddenly turned brown and died, and three  standard Dr. Grills which stood in a row and simply sulked. I had been  very excited about Dr. Grill, his description in the catalogues being  specially fascinating, and no doubt I deserved the snubbing I got.  “Never be excited, my dears, about anything,” shall be the advice I will  give the three babies when the time comes to take them out to parties,  “or, if you are, don’t show it. If by nature you are volcanoes, at least  be only smouldering ones. Don’t look pleased, don’t look interested,  don’t, above all things, look eager. Calm indifference should be written  on every feature of your faces. Never show that you like any one person,  or any one thing. Be cool, languid, and reserved. If you don’t do as  your mother tells you and are just gushing, frisky, young idiots, snubs  will be your portion. If you do as she tells you, you’ll marry princes  and live happily ever after.”    Dr. Grill must be a German rose. In this part of the world the more you  are pleased to see a person the less is he pleased to see you; whereas,  if you are disagreeable, he will grow pleasant visibly, his countenance  expanding into wider amiability the more your own is stiff and sour. But  I was not Prepared for that sort of thing in a rose, and was disgusted  with Dr. Grill. He had the best place in the garden--warm, sunny, and  sheltered; his holes were prepared with the tenderest care; he was given  the most dainty mixture of compost, clay, and manure; he was watered  assiduously all through the drought when more willing flowers got  nothing; and he refused to do anything but look black and shrivel. He  did not die, but neither did he live--he just existed; and at the end  of the summer not one of him had a scrap more shoot or leaf than when  he was first put in in April. It would have been better if he had died  straight away, for then I should have known what to do; as it is, there  he is still occupying the best place, wrapped up carefully for the  winter, excluding kinder roses, and probably intending to repeat the  same conduct next year. Well, trials are the portion of mankind, and  gardeners have their share, and in any case it is better to be tried by  plants than persons, seeing that with plants you know that it is you who  are in the wrong, and with persons it is always the other way about--and  who is there among us who has not felt the pangs of injured innocence,  and known them to be grievous?    I have two visitors staying with me, though I have done nothing to  provoke such an infliction, and had been looking forward to a happy  little Christmas alone with the Man of Wrath and the babies. Fate  decreed otherwise. Quite regularly, if I look forward to anything, Fate  steps in and decrees otherwise; I don’t know why it should, but it does.  I had not even invited these good ladies--like greatness on the modest,  they were thrust upon me. One is Irais, the sweet singer of the summer,  whom I love as she deserves, but of whom I certainly thought I had seen  the last for at least a year, when she wrote and asked if I would have  her over Christmas, as her husband was out of sorts, and she didn’t  like him in that state. Neither do I like sick husbands, so, full  of sympathy, I begged her to come, and here she is. And the other is  Minora.    Why I have to have Minora I don’t know, for I was not even aware of her  existence a fortnight ago. Then coming down cheerfully one morning to  breakfast--it was the very day after my return from England--I found  a letter from an English friend, who up till then had been perfectly  innocuous, asking me to befriend Minora. I read the letter aloud for the  benefit of the Man of Wrath, who was eating Spickgans, a delicacy much  sought after in these parts. “Do, my dear Elizabeth,” wrote my friend,  “take some notice of the poor thing. She is studying art in Dresden,  and has nowhere literally to go for Christmas. She is very ambitious and  hardworking--”    “Then,” interrupted the Man of Wrath, “she is not pretty. Only ugly  girls work hard.”    “--and she is really very clever--”    “I do not like clever girls, they are so stupid,” again interrupted the  Man of Wrath.    “--and unless some kind creature like yourself takes pity on her she  will be very lonely.”    “Then let her be lonely.”    “Her mother is my oldest friend, and would be greatly distressed to  think that her daughter should be alone in a foreign town at such a  season.”    “I do not mind the distress of the mother.”    “Oh, dear me,” I exclaimed impatiently, “I shall have to ask her to  come!”    “If you should be inclined,” the letter went on, “to play the good  Samaritan, dear Elizabeth, I am positive you would find Minora a bright,  intelligent companion--”    “Minora?” questioned the Man of Wrath.    The April baby, who has had a nursery governess of an altogether  alarmingly zealous type attached to her person for the last six weeks,  looked up from her bread and milk.    “It sounds like islands,” she remarked pensively.    The governess coughed.    “Majora, Minora, Alderney, and Sark,” explained her pupil.    I looked at her severely.    “If you are not careful, April,” I said, “you’ll be a genius when you  grow up and disgrace your parents.”    Miss Jones looked as though she did not like Germans. I am afraid she  despises us because she thinks we are foreigners--an attitude of mind  quite British and wholly to her credit; but we, on the other hand,  regard her as a foreigner, which, of course, makes things complicated.    “Shall I really have to have this strange girl?” I asked, addressing  nobody in particular and not expecting a reply.    “You need not have her,” said the Man of Wrath composedly, “but you  will. You will write to-day and cordially invite her, and when she has  been here twenty-four hours you will quarrel with her. I know you, my  dear.”    “Quarrel! I? With a little art-student?” Miss Jones cast down her eyes.  She is perpetually scenting a scene, and is always ready to bring whole  batteries of discretion and tact and good taste to bear on us, and seems  to know we are disputing in an unseemly manner when we would never dream  it ourselves but for the warning of her downcast eyes. I would take my  courage in both hands and ask her to go, for besides this superfluity of  discreet behaviour she is, although only nursery, much too zealous, and  inclined to be always teaching and never playing; but, unfortunately,  the April baby adores her and is sure there never was any one so  beautiful before. She comes every day with fresh accounts of the  splendours of her wardrobe, and feeling descriptions of her umbrellas  and hats; and Miss Jones looks offended and purses up her lips. In  common with most governesses, she has a little dark down on her  upper lip, and the April baby appeared one day at dinner with her  own decorated in faithful imitation, having achieved it after much  struggling, with the aid of a lead pencil and unbounded love. Miss Jones  put her in the corner for impertinence. I wonder why governesses are so  unpleasant. The Man of Wrath says it is because they are not married.  Without venturing to differ entirely from the opinion of experience, I  would add that the strain of continually having to set an example must  surely be very great. It is much easier, and often more pleasant, to be  a warning than an example, and governesses are but women, and women are  sometimes foolish, and when you want to be foolish it must be annoying  to have to be wise.    Minora and Irais arrived yesterday together; or rather, when the  carriage drove up, Irais got out of it alone, and informed me that there  was a strange girl on a bicycle a little way behind. I sent back the  carriage to pick her up, for it was dusk and the roads are terrible.    “But why do you have strange girls here at all?” asked Irais rather  peevishly, taking off her hat in the library before the fire, and  otherwise making herself very much at home; “I don’t like them. I’m not  sure that they’re not worse than husbands who are out of order. Who is  she? She would bicycle from the station, and is, I am sure, the first  woman who has done it. The little boys threw stones at her.”    “Oh, my dear, that only shows the ignorance of the little boys. Never  mind her. Let us have tea in peace before she comes.” “But we should be  much happier without her,” she grumbled. “Weren’t we happy enough in the  summer, Elizabeth--just you and I?”    “Yes, indeed we were,” I answered heartily, putting my arms round her.  The flame of my affection for Irais burns very brightly on the day of  her arrival; besides, this time I have prudently provided against her  sinning with the salt-cellars by ordering them to be handed round like  vegetable dishes. We had finished tea and she had gone up to her room to  dress before Minora and her bicycle were got here. I hurried out to meet  her, feeling sorry for her, plunged into a circle of strangers at such a  very personal season as Christmas. But she was not very shy; indeed, she  was less shy than I was, and lingered in the hall, giving the servants  directions to wipe the snow off the tyres of her machine before she lent  an attentive ear to my welcoming remarks.    “I couldn’t make your man understand me at the station,” she said at  last, when her mind was at rest about her bicycle; “I asked him how far  it was, and what the roads were like, and he only smiled. Is he German?  But of course he is--how odd that he didn’t understand. You speak  English very well,--very well indeed, do you know.” By this time we were  in the library, and she stood on the hearth-rug warming her back while I  poured her out some tea.    “What a quaint room,” she remarked, looking round, “and the hall is so  curious too. Very old, isn’t it? There’s a lot of copy here.”    The Man of Wrath, who had been in the hall on her arrival and had come  in with us, began to look about on the carpet. “Copy” he inquired,  “Where’s copy?”    “Oh--material, you know, for a book. I’m just jotting down what strikes  me in your country, and when I have time shall throw it into book form.”   She spoke very loud, as English people always do to foreigners.    “My dear,” I said breathlessly to Irais, when I had got into her room  and shut the door and Minora was safely in hers, “what do you think--she  writes books!”    “What--the bicycling girl?”    “Yes--Minora--imagine it!”    We stood and looked at each other with awestruck faces.    “How dreadful!” murmured Irais. “I never met a young girl who did that  before.”    “She says this place is full of copy.” “Full of what?”    “That’s what you make books with.”    “Oh, my dear, this is worse than I expected! A strange girl is always  a bore among good friends, but one can generally manage her. But a girl  who writes books--why, it isn’t respectable! And you can’t snub that  sort of people; they’re unsnubbable.”    “Oh, but we’ll try!” I cried, with such heartiness that we both laughed.    The hall and the library struck Minora most; indeed, she lingered so  long after dinner in the hall, which is cold, that the Man of Wrath put  on his fur coat by way of a gentle hint. His hints are always gentle.    She wanted to hear the whole story about the chapel and the nuns and  Gustavus Adolphus, and pulling out a fat note-book began to take down  what I said. I at once relapsed into silence.    “Well?” she said.    “That’s all.”    “Oh, but you’ve only just begun.”    “It doesn’t go any further. Won’t you come into the library?”    In the library she again took up her stand before the fire and warmed  herself, and we sat in a row and were cold. She has a wonderfully good  profile, which is irritating. The wind, however, is tempered to the  shorn lamb by her eyes being set too closely together.    Irais lit a cigarette, and leaning back in her chair, contemplated her  critically beneath her long eyelashes. “You are writing a book?” she  asked presently.    “Well--yes, I suppose I may say that I am. Just my impressions, you  know, of your country. Anything that strikes me as curious or amusing--I  jot it down, and when I have time shall work it up into something, I  daresay.”    “Are you not studying painting?”    “Yes, but I can’t study that for ever. We have an English proverb: ‘Life  is short and Art is long’--too long, I sometimes think--and writing is a  great relaxation when I am tired.”    “What shall you call it?”    “Oh, I thought of calling it Journeyings in Germany. It sounds well, and  would be correct. Or Jottings from German Journeyings,--I haven’t quite  decided yet which.”    “By the author of Prowls in Pomerania, you might add,” suggested Irais.    “And Drivel from Dresden,” said I.    “And Bosh from Berlin,” added Irais.    Minora stared. “I don’t think those two last ones would do,” she said,  “because it is not to be a facetious book. But your first one is  rather a good title,” she added, looking at Irais and drawing out her  note-book. “I think I’ll just jot that down.”    “If you jot down all we say and then publish it, will it still be your  book?” asked Irais.    But Minora was so busy scribbling that she did not hear.    “And have you no suggestions to make, Sage?” asked Irais, turning to the  Man of Wrath, who was blowing out clouds of smoke in silence.    “Oh, do you call him Sage?” cried Minora; “and always in English?”    Irais and I looked at each other. We knew what we did call him, and were  afraid Minora would in time ferret it out and enter it in her note-book.  The Man of Wrath looked none too well pleased to be alluded to under his  very nose by our new guest as “him.”    “Husbands are always sages,” said I gravely.    “Though sages are not always husbands,” said Irais with equal gravity.  “Sages and husbands--sage and husbands--” she went on musingly, “what  does that remind you of, Miss Minora?”    “Oh, I know,--how stupid of me!” cried Minora eagerly, her pencil in  mid-air and her brain clutching at the elusive recollection, “sage  and,--why,--yes,--no,--yes, of course--oh,” disappointedly, “but that’s  vulgar--I can’t put it in.”    “What is vulgar?” I asked.    “She thinks sage and onions is vulgar,” said Irais languidly; “but  it isn’t, it is very good.” She got up and walked to the piano, and,  sitting down, began, after a little wandering over the keys, to sing.    “Do you play?” I asked Minora.    “Yes, but I am afraid I am rather out of practice.”    I said no more. I know what that sort of playing is.    When we were lighting our bedroom candles Minora began suddenly to  speak in an unknown tongue. We stared. “What is the matter with her?”   murmured Irais.    “I thought, perhaps,” said Minora in English, “you might prefer to talk  German, and as it is all the same to me what I talk--” “Oh, pray don’t  trouble,” said Irais. “We like airing our English--don’t we, Elizabeth?”    “I don’t want my German to get rusty though,” said Minora; “I shouldn’t  like to forget it.”    “Oh, but isn’t there an English song,” said Irais, twisting round her  neck as she preceded us upstairs, “‘’Tis folly to remember, ‘tis wisdom  to forget’?”    “You are not nervous sleeping alone, I hope,” I said hastily.    “What room is she in?” asked Irais.    “No. 12.”    “Oh!--do you believe in ghosts?”    Minora turned pale.    “What nonsense,” said I; “we have no ghosts here. Good-night. If you  want anything, mind you ring.”    “And if you see anything curious in that room,” called Irais from her  bedroom door, “mind you jot it down.”      December 27th--It is the fashion, I believe, to regard Christmas as a  bore of rather a gross description, and as a time when you are invited  to over-eat yourself, and pretend to be merry without just cause. As a  matter of fact, it is one of the prettiest and most poetic institutions  possible, if observed in the proper manner, and after having been more  or less unpleasant to everybody for a whole year, it is a blessing to be  forced on that one day to be amiable, and it is certainly delightful to  be able to give presents without being haunted by the conviction that  you are spoiling the recipient, and will suffer for it afterward.  Servants are only big children, and are made just as happy as children  by little presents and nice things to eat, and, for days beforehand,  every time the three babies go into the garden they expect to meet the  Christ Child with His arms full of gifts. They firmly believe that it  is thus their presents are brought, and it is such a charming idea that  Christmas would be worth celebrating for its sake alone.    As great secrecy is observed, the preparations devolve entirely on me,  and it is not very easy work, with so many people in our own house and  on each of the farms, and all the children, big and little, expecting  their share of happiness. The library is uninhabitable for several days  before and after, as it is there that we have the trees and presents.  All down one side are the trees, and the other three sides are lined  with tables, a separate one for each person in the house. When the  trees are lighted, and stand in their radiance shining down on the happy  faces, I forget all the trouble it has been, and the number of times I  have had to run up and down stairs, and the various aches in head  and feet, and enjoy myself as much as anybody. First the June baby is  ushered in, then the others and ourselves according to age, then  the servants, then come the head inspector and his family, the other  inspectors from the different farms, the mamsells, the bookkeepers and  secretaries, and then all the children, troops and troops of them--the  big ones leading the little ones by the hand and carrying the babies in  their arms, and the mothers peeping round the door. As many as can get  in stand in front of the trees, and sing two or three carols; then they  are given their presents, and go off triumphantly, making room for the  next batch. My three babies sang lustily too, whether they happened to  know what was being sung or not. They had on white dresses in honour  of the occasion, and the June baby was even arrayed in a low-necked and  short-sleeved garment, after the manner of Teutonic infants,  whatever the state of the thermometer. Her arms are like miniature  prize-fighter’s arms--I never saw such things; they are the pride and  joy of her little nurse, who had tied them up with blue ribbons, and  kept on kissing them. I shall certainly not be able to take her to balls  when she grows up, if she goes on having arms like that.    When they came to say good-night, they were all very pale and subdued.  The April baby had an exhausted-looking Japanese doll with her, which  she said she was taking to bed, not because she liked him, but because  she was so sorry for him, he seemed so very tired. They kissed me  absently, and went away, only the April baby glancing at the trees as  she passed and making them a curtesy.    “Good-bye, trees,” I heard her say; and then she made the Japanese doll  bow to them, which he did, in a very languid and blase fashion. “You’ll  never see such trees again,” she told him, giving him a vindictive  shake, “for you’ll be brokened long before next time.”    She went out, but came back as though she had forgotten something.    “Thank the Christkind so much, Mummy, won’t you, for all the lovely  things He brought us. I suppose you’re writing to Him now, isn’t you?”    I cannot see that there was anything gross about our Christmas, and we  were perfectly merry without any need to pretend, and for at least two  days it brought us a little nearer together, and made us kind. Happiness  is so wholesome; it invigorates and warms me into piety far more  effectually than any amount of trials and griefs, and an unexpected  pleasure is the surest means of bringing me to my knees. In spite of the  protestations of some peculiarly constructed persons that they are the  better for trials, I don’t believe it. Such things must sour us, just as  happiness must sweeten us, and make us kinder, and more gentle. And will  anybody affirm that it behoves us to be more thankful for trials  than for blessings? We were meant to be happy, and to accept all the  happiness offered with thankfulness--indeed, we are none of us ever  thankful enough, and yet we each get so much, so very much, more than  we deserve. I know a woman--she stayed with me last summer--who rejoices  grimly when those she loves suffer. She believes that it is our lot,  and that it braces us and does us good, and she would shield no one from  even unnecessary pain; she weeps with the sufferer, but is convinced it  is all for the best. Well, let her continue in her dreary beliefs; she  has no garden to teach her the beauty and the happiness of holiness, nor  does she in the least desire to possess one; her convictions have  the sad gray colouring of the dingy streets and houses she lives  amongst--the sad colour of humanity in masses. Submission to what people  call their “lot” is simply ignoble. If your lot makes you cry and be  wretched, get rid of it and take another; strike out for yourself;  don’t listen to the shrieks of your relations, to their gibes or their  entreaties; don’t let your own microscopic set prescribe your goings-out  and comings-in; don’t be afraid of public opinion in the shape of the  neighbour in the next house, when all the world is before you new and  shining, and everything is possible, if you will only be energetic and  independent and seize opportunity by the scruff of the neck.    “To hear you talk,” said Irais, “no one would ever imagine that you  dream away your days in a garden with a book, and that you never in your  life seized anything by the scruff of its neck. And what is scruff?  I hope I have not got any on me.” And she craned her neck before the  glass.    She and Minora were going to help me decorate the trees, but very soon  Irais wandered off to the piano, and Minora was tired and took up a  book; so I called in Miss Jones and the babies--it was Miss Jones’s last  public appearance, as I shall relate--and after working for the best  part of two days they were finished, and looked like lovely ladies  in widespreading, sparkling petticoats, holding up their skirts with  glittering fingers. Minora wrote a long description of them for a  chapter of her book which is headed Noel,--I saw that much, because she  left it open on the table while she went to talk to Miss Jones. They  were fast friends from the very first, and though it is said to be  natural to take to one’s own countrymen, I am unable altogether to  sympathise with such a reason for sudden affection.    “I wonder what they talk about?” I said to Irais yesterday, when there  was no getting Minora to come to tea, so deeply was she engaged in  conversation with Miss Jones.    “Oh, my dear, how can I tell? Lovers, I suppose, or else they think they  are clever, and then they talk rubbish.”    “Well, of course, Minora thinks she is clever.”    “I suppose she does. What does it matter what she thinks? Why does your  governess look so gloomy? When I see her at luncheon I always imagine  she must have just heard that somebody is dead. But she can’t hear that  every day. What is the matter with her?”    “I don’t think she feels quite as proper as she looks,” I said  doubtfully; I was for ever trying to account for Miss Jones’s  expression.    “But that must be rather nice,” said Irais. “It would be awful for her  if she felt exactly the same as she looks.”    At that moment the door leading into the schoolroom opened softly,  and the April baby, tired of playing, came in and sat down at my feet,  leaving the door open; and this is what we heard Miss Jones saying--    “Parents are seldom wise, and the strain the conscientious place upon  themselves to appear so before their children and governess must be  terrible. Nor are clergymen more pious than other men, yet they have  continually to pose before their flock as such. As for governesses, Miss  Minora, I know what I am saying when I affirm that there is nothing more  intolerable than to have to be polite, and even humble, to persons whose  weaknesses and follies are glaringly apparent in every word they utter,  and to be forced by the presence of children and employers to a dignity  of manner in no way corresponding to one’s feelings. The grave father of  a family, who was probably one of the least respectable of bachelors, is  an interesting study at his own table, where he is constrained to assume  airs of infallibility merely because his children are looking at him.  The fact of his being a parent does not endow him with any supreme and  sudden virtue; and I can assure you that among the eyes fixed upon him,  not the least critical and amused are those of the humble person who  fills the post of governess.”    “Oh, Miss Jones, how lovely!” we heard Minora say in accents of rapture,  while we sat transfixed with horror at these sentiments. “Do you mind if  I put that down in my book? You say it all so beautifully.”    “Without a few hours of relaxation,” continued Miss Jones, “of private  indemnification for the toilsome virtues displayed in public, who could  wade through days of correct behaviour? There would be no reaction, no  room for better impulses, no place for repentance. Parents, priests, and  governesses would be in the situation of a stout lady who never has a  quiet moment in which she can take off her corsets.”    “My dear, what a firebrand!” whispered Irais. I got up and went in. They  were sitting on the sofa, Minora with clasped hands, gazing admiringly  into Miss Jones’s face, which wore a very different expression from the  one of sour and unwilling propriety I have been used to seeing.    “May I ask you to come to tea?” I said to Minora. “And I should like to  have the children a little while.”    She got up very reluctantly, but I waited with the door open until she  had gone in and the two babies had followed. They had been playing at  stuffing each other’s ears with pieces of newspaper while Miss Jones  provided Minora with noble thoughts for her work, and had to be tortured  afterward with tweezers. I said nothing to Minora, but kept her with us  till dinner-time, and this morning we went for a long sleigh-drive. When  we came in to lunch there was no Miss Jones.    “Is Miss Jones ill?” asked Minora.    “She is gone,” I said.    “Gone?”    “Did you never hear of such things as sick mothers?” asked Irais  blandly; and we talked resolutely of something else.    All the afternoon Minora has moped. She had found a kindred spirit, and  it has been ruthlessly torn from her arms as kindred spirits so often  are. It is enough to make her mope, and it is not her fault, poor thing,  that she should have preferred the society of a Miss Jones to that of  Irais and myself.    At dinner Irais surveyed her with her head on one side. “You look so  pale,” she said; “are you not well?”    Minora raised her eyes heavily, with the patient air of one who likes to  be thought a sufferer. “I have a slight headache,” she replied gently.    “I hope you are not going to be ill,” said Irais with great concern,  “because there is only a cow-doctor to be had here, and though he means  well, I believe he is rather rough.” Minora was plainly startled. “But  what do you do if you are ill?” she asked.    “Oh, we are never ill,” said I; “the very knowledge that there would be  no one to cure us seems to keep us healthy.”    “And if any one takes to her bed,” said Irais, “Elizabeth always calls  in the cow-doctor.”    Minora was silent. She feels, I am sure, that she has got into a part  of the world peopled solely by barbarians, and that the only civilised  creature besides herself has departed and left her at our mercy.  Whatever her reflections may be her symptoms are visibly abating.      January 1st.--The service on New Year’s Eve is the only one in the whole  year that in the least impresses me in our little church, and then the  very bareness and ugliness of the place and the ceremonial produce an  effect that a snug service in a well-lit church never would. Last night  we took Irais and Minora, and drove the three lonely miles in a sleigh.  It was pitch-dark, and blowing great guns. We sat wrapped up to our eyes  in furs, and as mute as a funeral procession.    “We are going to the burial of our last year’s sins,” said Irais, as we  started; and there certainly was a funereal sort of feeling in the air.  Up in our gallery pew we tried to decipher our chorales by the light  of the spluttering tallow candles stuck in holes in the woodwork, the  flames wildly blown about by the draughts. The wind banged against the  windows in great gusts, screaming louder than the organ, and threatening  to blow out the agitated lights together. The parson in his gloomy  pulpit, surrounded by a framework of dusty carved angels, took on an  awful appearance of menacing Authority as he raised his voice to make  himself heard above the clatter. Sitting there in the dark, I felt  very small, and solitary, and defenceless, alone in a great, big, black  world. The church was as cold as a tomb; some of the candles guttered  and went out; the parson in his black robe spoke of death and judgment;  I thought I heard a child’s voice screaming, and could hardly believe it  was only the wind, and felt uneasy and full of forebodings; all my faith  and philosophy deserted me, and I had a horrid feeling that I should  probably be well punished, though for what I had no precise idea. If it  had not been so dark, and if the wind had not howled so despairingly,  I should have paid little attention to the threats issuing from the  pulpit; but, as it was, I fell to making good resolutions. This is  always a bad sign,--only those who break them make them; and if you  simply do as a matter of course that which is right as it comes, any  preparatory resolving to do so becomes completely superfluous. I have  for some years past left off making them on New Year’s Eve, and only the  gale happening as it did reduced me to doing so last night; for I have  long since discovered that, though the year and the resolutions may be  new, I myself am not, and it is worse than useless putting new wine into  old bottles.    “But I am not an old bottle,” said Irais indignantly, when I held forth  to her to the above effect a few hours later in the library, restored  to all my philosophy by the warmth and light, “and I find my resolutions  carry me very nicely into the spring. I revise them at the end of each  month, and strike out the unnecessary ones. By the end of April they  have been so severely revised that there are none left.”    “There, you see I am right; if you were not an old bottle your new  contents would gradually arrange themselves amiably as a part of you,  and the practice of your resolutions would lose its bitterness by  becoming a habit.”    She shook her head. “Such things never lose their bitterness,” she said,  “and that is why I don’t let them cling to me right into the summer.  When May comes, I give myself up to jollity with all the rest of the  world, and am too busy being happy to bother about anything I may have  resolved when the days were cold and dark.”    “And that is just why I love you,” I thought. She often says what I  feel.    “I wonder,” she went on after a pause, “whether men ever make  resolutions?”    “I don’t think they do. Only women indulge in such luxuries. It is a  nice sort of feeling, when you have nothing else to do, giving way  to endless grief and penitence, and steeping yourself to the eyes in  contrition; but it is silly. Why cry over things that are done? Why do  naughty things at all, if you are going to repent afterward? Nobody is  naughty unless they like being naughty; and nobody ever really repents  unless they are afraid they are going to be found out.”    “By ‘nobody’ of course you mean women, said Irais.    “Naturally; the terms are synonymous. Besides, men generally have the  courage of their opinions.”    “I hope you are listening, Miss Minora,” said Irais in the amiably  polite tone she assumes whenever she speaks to that young person.    It was getting on towards midnight, and we were sitting round the fire,  waiting for the New Year, and sipping Glubwein, prepared at a small  table by the Man of Wrath. It was hot, and sweet, and rather nasty, but  it is proper to drink it on this one night, so of course we did.    Minora does not like either Irais or myself. We very soon discovered  that, and laugh about it when we are alone together. I can understand  her disliking Irais, but she must be a perverse creature not to like me.  Irais has poked fun at her, and I have been, I hope, very kind; yet we  are bracketed together in her black books. It is also apparent that she  looks upon the Man of Wrath as an interesting example of an ill-used and  misunderstood husband, and she is disposed to take him under her wing,  and defend him on all occasions against us. He never speaks to her; he  is at all times a man of few words, but, as far as Minora is concerned,  he might have no tongue at all, and sits sphinx-like and impenetrable  while she takes us to task about some remark of a profane nature that we  may have addressed to him. One night, some days after her arrival, she  developed a skittishness of manner which has since disappeared, and  tried to be playful with him; but you might as well try to be playful  with a graven image. The wife of one of the servants had just produced a  boy, the first after a series of five daughters, and at dinner we drank  the health of all parties concerned, the Man of Wrath making the  happy father drink a glass off at one gulp, his heels well together in  military fashion. Minora thought the incident typical of German  manners, and not only made notes about it, but joined heartily in the  health-drinking, and afterward grew skittish.    She proposed, first of all, to teach us a dance called, I think, the  Washington Post, and which was, she said, much danced in England;  and, to induce us to learn, she played the tune to us on the piano.  We remained untouched by its beauties, each buried in an easy-chair  toasting our toes at the fire. Amongst those toes were those of the  Man of Wrath, who sat peaceably reading a book and smoking. Minora  volunteered to show us the steps, and as we still did not move, danced  solitary behind our chairs. Irais did not even turn her head to look,  and I was the only one amiable or polite enough to do so. Do I deserve  to be placed in Minora’s list of disagreeable people side by side with  Irais? Certainly not. Yet I most surely am.    “It wants the music, of course,” observed Minora breathlessly, darting  in and out between the chairs, apparently addressing me, but glancing at  the Man of Wrath.    No answer from anybody.    “It is such a pretty dance,” she panted again, after a few more  gyrations.    No answer.    “And is all the rage at home.”    No answer.    “Do let me teach you. Won’t you try, Herr Sage?”    She went up to him and dropped him a little curtesy. It is thus she  always addresses him, entirely oblivious to the fact, so patent to every  one else, that he resents it.    “Oh come, put away that tiresome old book,” she went on gaily, as he did  not move; “I am certain it is only some dry agricultural work that you  just nod over. Dancing is much better for you.” Irais and I looked at  one another quite frightened. I am sure we both turned pale when the  unhappy girl actually laid hold forcibly of his book, and, with a  playful little shriek, ran away with it into the next room, hugging it  to her bosom and looking back roguishly over her shoulder at him as she  ran. There was an awful pause. We hardly dared raise our eyes. Then the  Mall of Wrath got up slowly, knocked the ashes off the end of his cigar,  looked at his watch, and went out at the opposite door into his own  rooms, where he stayed for the rest of the evening. She has never, I  must say, been skittish since.    “I hope you are listening, Miss Minora,” said Irais, “because this sort  of conversation is likely to do you good.”    “I always listen when people talk sensibly,” replied Minora, stirring  her grog.    Irais glanced at her with slightly doubtful eyebrows. “Do you agree with  our hostess’s description of women?” she asked after a pause.    “As nobodies? No, of course I do not.”    “Yet she is right. In the eye of the law we are literally nobodies in  our country. Did you know that women are forbidden to go to political  meetings here?” “Really?” Out came the note-book.    “The law expressly forbids the attendance at such meetings of women,  children, and idiots.”    “Children and idiots--I understand that,” said Minora; “but women--and  classed with children and idiots?”    “Classed with children and idiots,” repeated Irais, gravely nodding her  head. “Did you know that the law forbids females of any age to ride on  the top of omnibuses or tramcars?”    “Not really?”    “Do you know why?”    “I can’t imagine.”    “Because in going up and down the stairs those inside might perhaps  catch a glimpse of the stocking covering their ankles.”    “But what--”    “Did you know that the morals of the German public are in such a shaky  condition that a glimpse of that sort would be fatal to them?”    “But I don’t see how a stocking--”    “With stripes round it,” said Irais.    “And darns in it,” I added, “--could possibly be pernicious?”    “‘The Pernicious Stocking; or, Thoughts on the Ethics of Petticoats,’”   said Irais. “Put that down as the name of your next book on Germany.”    “I never know,” complained Minora, letting her note-book fall, “whether  you are in earnest or not.”    “Don’t you?” said Irais sweetly.    “Is it true,” appealed Minora to the Man of Wrath, busy with his lemons  in the background, “that your law classes women with children and  idiots?”    “Certainly,” he answered promptly, “and a very proper classification,  too.”    We all looked blank. “That’s rude,” said I at last.    “Truth is always rude, my dear,” he replied complacently. Then he added,  “If I were commissioned to draw up a new legal code, and had previously  enjoyed the privilege, as I have been doing lately, of listening to the  conversation of you three young ladies, I should make precisely the same  classification.”    Even Minora was incensed at this.    “You are telling us in the most unvarnished manner that we are idiots,”   said Irais.    “Idiots? No, no, by no means. But children,--nice little agreeable  children. I very much like to hear you talk together. It is all so young  and fresh what you think and what you believe, and not of the least  consequence to any one.    “Not of the least consequence?” cried Minora. “What we believe is of  very great consequence indeed to us.”    “Are you jeering at our beliefs?” inquired Irais sternly.    “Not for worlds. I would not on any account disturb or change your  pretty little beliefs. It is your chief charm that you always believe  every-thing. How desperate would our case be if young ladies only  believed facts, and never accepted another person’s assurance, but  preferred the evidence of their own eyes! They would have no illusions,  and a woman without illusions is the dreariest and most difficult thing  to manage possible.”    “Thing?” protested Irais.    The Man of Wrath, usually so silent, makes up for it from time to time  by holding forth at unnecessary length. He took up his stand now with  his back to the fire, and a glass of Glubwein in his hand. Minora had  hardly heard his voice before, so quiet had he been since she came, and  sat with her pencil raised, ready to fix for ever the wisdom that should  flow from his lips.    “What would become of poetry if women became so sensible that they  turned a deaf ear to the poetic platitudes of love? That love does  indulge in platitudes I suppose you will admit.” He looked at Irais.    “Yes, they all say exactly the same thing,” she acknowledged.    “Who could murmur pretty speeches on the beauty of a common sacrifice,  if the listener’s want of imagination was such as to enable her only to  distinguish one victim in the picture, and that one herself?”    Minora took that down word for word,--much good may it do her.    “Who would be brave enough to affirm that if refused he will die, if  his assurances merely elicit a recommendation to diet himself, and take  plenty of outdoor exercise? Women are responsible for such lies, because  they believe them. Their amazing vanity makes them swallow flattery so  gross that it is an insult, and men will always be ready to tell the  precise number of lies that a woman is ready to listen to. Who indulges  more recklessly in glowing exaggerations than the lover who hopes, and  has not yet obtained? He will, like the nightingale, sing with unceasing  modulations, display all his talent, untiringly repeat his  sweetest notes, until he has what he wants, when his song, like the  nightingale’s, immediately ceases, never again to be heard.”    “Take that down,” murmured Irais aside to Minora--unnecessary advice,  for her pencil was scribbling as fast as it could.    “A woman’s vanity is so immeasurable that, after having had ninety-nine  object-lessons in the difference between promise and performance and the  emptiness of pretty speeches, the beginning of the hundredth will find  her lending the same willing and enchanted ear to the eloquence  of flattery as she did on the occasion of the first. What can the  exhortations of the strong-minded sister, who has never had these  experiences, do for such a woman? It is useless to tell her she is man’s  victim, that she is his plaything, that she is cheated, down-trodden,  kept under, laughed at, shabbily treated in every way--that is not a  true statement of the case. She is simply the victim of her own vanity,  and against that, against the belief in her own fascinations, against  the very part of herself that gives all the colour to her life, who  shall expect a woman to take up arms?”    “Are you so vain, Elizabeth?” inquired Irais with a shocked face, “and  had you lent a willing ear to the blandishments of ninety-nine before  you reached your final destiny?”    “I am one of the sensible ones, I suppose,” I replied, “for nobody ever  wanted me to listen to blandishments.”    Minora sighed.    “I like to hear you talk together about the position of women,” he  went on, “and wonder when you will realise that they hold exactly  the position they are fitted for. As soon as they are fit to occupy  a better, no power on earth will be able to keep them out of it.  Meanwhile, let me warn you that, as things now are, only strong-minded  women wish to see you the equals of men, and the strong-minded are  invariably plain. The pretty ones would rather see men their slaves than  their equals.”    “You know,” said Irais, frowning, “that I consider myself  strong-minded.”    “And never rise till lunch-time?”    Irais blushed. Although I don’t approve of such conduct, it is very  convenient in more ways than one; I get through my housekeeping  undisturbed, and whenever she is disposed to lecture me, I begin about  this habit of hers. Her conscience must be terribly stricken on the  point, for she is by no means as a rule given to meekness.    “A woman without vanity would be unattackable,” resumed the Man of  Wrath. “When a girl enters that downward path that leads to ruin, she  is led solely by her own vanity; for in these days of policemen no young  woman can be forced against her will from the path of virtue, and the  cries of the injured are never heard until the destroyer begins to  express his penitence for having destroyed. If his passion could  remain at white-heat and he could continue to feed her ear with the  protestations she loves, no principles of piety or virtue would disturb  the happiness of his companion; for a mournful experience teaches that  piety begins only where passion ends, and that principles are strongest  where temptations are most rare.”    “But what has all this to do with us?” I inquired severely.    “You were displeased at our law classing you as it does, and I merely  wish to justify it,” he answered. “Creatures who habitually say yes to  everything a man proposes, when no one can oblige them to say it, and  when it is so often fatal, are plainly not responsible beings.”    “I shall never say it to you again, my dear man,” I said.    “And not only that fatal weakness,” he continued, “but what is there,  candidly, to distinguish you from children? You are older, but not  wiser,--really not so wise, for with years you lose the common sense you  had as children. Have you ever heard a group of women talking reasonably  together?”    “Yes--we do!” Irais and I cried in a breath.    “It has interested me,” went on the Man of Wrath, “in my idle moments,  to listen to their talk. It amused me to hear the malicious little  stories they told of their best friends who were absent, to note the  spiteful little digs they gave their best friends who were present, to  watch the utter incredulity with which they listened to the tale of  some other woman’s conquests, the radiant good faith they displayed in  connection with their own, the instant collapse into boredom, if some  topic of so-called general interest, by some extraordinary chance,  were introduced.” “You must have belonged to a particularly nice set,”   remarked Irais.    “And as for politics,” he said, “I have never heard them mentioned among  women.”    “Children and idiots are not interested in such things,” I said.    “And we are much too frightened of being put in prison,” said Irais.    “In prison?” echoed Minora.    “Don’t you know,” said Irais, turning to her “that if you talk about  such things here you run a great risk of being imprisoned?”    “But why?”    “But why? Because, though you yourself may have meant nothing but what  was innocent, your words may have suggested something less innocent to  the evil minds of your hearers; and then the law steps in, and calls  it dolus eventualis, and everybody says how dreadful, and off you go to  prison and are punished as you deserve to be.”    Minora looked mystified.    “That is not, however, your real reason for not discussing them,” said  the Man of Wrath; “they simply do not interest you. Or it may be, that  you do not consider your female friends’ opinions worth listening to,  for you certainly display an astonishing thirst for information when  male politicians are present. I have seen a pretty young woman, hardly  in her twenties, sitting a whole evening drinking in the doubtful wisdom  of an elderly political star, with every appearance of eager interest.  He was a bimetallic star, and was giving her whole pamphletsful of  information.”    “She wanted to make up to him for some reason,” said Irais, “and got him  to explain his hobby to her, and he was silly enough to be taken in. Now  which was the sillier in that case?”    She threw herself back in her chair and looked up defiantly, beating her  foot impatiently on the carpet.    “She wanted to be thought clever,” said the Man of Wrath. “What puzzled  me,” he went on musingly, “was that she went away apparently as serene  and happy as when she came. The explanation of the principles of  bimetallism produce, as a rule, a contrary effect.”    “Why, she hadn’t been listening,” cried Irais, “and your simple star had  been making a fine goose of himself the whole evening.                “Prattle, prattle, simple star,               Bimetallic, wunderbar.              Though you’re given to describe              Woman as a dummes Weib.              You yourself are sillier far,              Prattling, bimetallic star!”    “No doubt she had understood very little,” said the Man of Wrath, taking  no notice of this effusion.    “And no doubt the gentleman hadn’t understood much either.” Irais was  plainly irritated.    “Your opinion of woman,” said Minora in a very small voice, “is not  a high one. But, in the sick chamber, I suppose you agree that no one  could take her place?”    “If you are thinking of hospital-nurses,” I said, “I must tell you that  I believe he married chiefly that he might have a wife instead of a  strange woman to nurse him when he is sick.”    “But,” said Minora, bewildered at the way her illusions were being  knocked about, “the sick-room is surely the very place of all others in  which a woman’s gentleness and tact are most valuable.”    “Gentleness and tact?” repeated the Man of Wrath. “I have never met  those qualities in the professional nurse. According to my experience,  she is a disagreeable person who finds in private nursing exquisite  opportunities for asserting her superiority over ordinary and prostrate  mankind. I know of no more humiliating position for a man than to be  in bed having his feverish brow soothed by a sprucely-dressed strange  woman, bristling with starch and spotlessness. He would give half his  income for his clothes, and probably the other half if she would leave  him alone, and go away altogether. He feels her superiority through  every pore; he never before realised how absolutely inferior he is; he  is abjectly polite, and contemptibly conciliatory; if a friend comes to  see him, he eagerly praises her in case she should be listening behind  the screen; he cannot call his soul his own, and, what is far more  intolerable, neither is he sure that his body really belongs to him; he  has read of ministering angels and the light touch of a woman’s hand,  but the day on which he can ring for his servant and put on his socks in  private fills him with the same sort of wildness of joy that he felt as  a homesick schoolboy at the end of his first term.”    Minora was silent. Irais’s foot was livelier than ever. The Man of Wrath  stood smiling blandly down upon us. You can’t argue with a person so  utterly convinced of his infallibility that he won’t even get angry with  you; so we sat round and said nothing.    “If,” he went on, addressing Irais, who looked rebellious, “you doubt  the truth of my remarks, and still cling to the old poetic notion of  noble, self-sacrificing women tenderly helping the patient over the  rough places on the road to death or recovery, let me beg you to try  for yourself, next time any one in your house is ill, whether the actual  fact in any way corresponds to the picturesque belief. The angel who is  to alleviate our sufferings comes in such a questionable shape, that  to the unimaginative she appears merely as an extremely self-confident  young woman, wisely concerned first of all in securing her personal  comfort, much given to complaints about her food and to helplessness  where she should be helpful, possessing an extraordinary capacity for  fancying herself slighted, or not regarded as the superior being she  knows herself to be, morbidly anxious lest the servants should, by some  mistake, treat her with offensive cordiality, pettish if the patient  gives more trouble than she had expected, intensely injured and  disagreeable if he is made so courageous by his wretchedness as to wake  her during the night--an act of desperation of which I was guilty once,  and once only. Oh, these good women! What sane man wants to have to do  with angels? And especially do we object to having them about us when we  are sick and sorry, when we feel in every fibre what poor things we are,  and when all our fortitude is needed to enable us to bear our temporary  inferiority patiently, without being forced besides to assume an  attitude of eager and grovelling politeness towards the angel in the  house.”    There was a pause.    “I didn’t know you could talk so much, Sage,” said Irais at length.    “What would you have women do, then?” asked Minora meekly. Irais began  to beat her foot up and down again,--what did it matter what Men of  Wrath would have us do? “There are not,” continued Minora, blushing,  “husbands enough for every one, and the rest must do something.”    “Certainly,” replied the oracle. “Study the art of pleasing by dress and  manner as long as you are of an age to interest us, and above all,  let all women, pretty and plain, married and single, study the art  of cookery. If you are an artist in the kitchen you will always be  esteemed.”    I sat very still. Every German woman, even the wayward Irais, has  learned to cook; I seem to have been the only one who was naughty and  wouldn’t.    “Only be careful,” he went on, “in studying both arts, never to forget  the great truth that dinner precedes blandishments and not blandishments  dinner. A man must be made comfortable before he will make love to you;  and though it is true that if you offered him a choice between Spickgans  and kisses, he would say he would take both, yet he would invariably  begin with the Spickgans, and allow the kisses to wait.”    At this I got up, and Irais followed my example. “Your cynicism is  disgusting,” I said icily.    “You two are always exceptions to anything I may say,” he said, smiling  amiably.    He stooped and kissed Irais’s hand. She is inordinately vain of her  hands, and says her husband married her for their sake, which I can  quite believe. I am glad they are on her and not on Minora, for if  Minora had had them I should have been annoyed. Minora’s are bony, with  chilly-looking knuckles, ignored nails, and too much wrist. I feel very  well disposed towards her when my eye falls on them. She put one forward  now, evidently thinking it would be kissed too.    “Did you know,” said Irais, seeing the movement, “that it is the custom  here to kiss women’s hands?”    “But only married women’s,” I added, not desiring her to feel out of it,  “never young girls’.”    She drew it in again. “It is a pretty custom,” she said with a sigh; and  pensively inscribed it in her book.      January 15th.--The bills for my roses and bulbs and other last year’s  horticultural indulgences were all on the table when I came down  to breakfast this morning. They rather frightened me. Gardening is  expensive, I find, when it has to be paid for out of one’s own private  pin-money. The Man of Wrath does not in the least want roses, or  flowering shrubs, or plantations, or new paths, and therefore, he asks,  why should he pay for them? So he does not and I do, and I have to make  up for it by not indulging all too riotously in new clothes, which is no  doubt very chastening. I certainly prefer buying new rose-trees to new  dresses, if I cannot comfortably have both; and I see a time coming when  the passion for my garden will have taken such a hold on me that I shall  not only entirely cease buying more clothes, but begin to sell those  that I already have. The garden is so big that everything has to be  bought wholesale; and I fear I shall not be able to go on much longer  with only one man and a stork, because the more I plant the more there  will be to water in the inevitable drought, and the watering is a  serious consideration when it means going backwards and forwards all day  long to a pump near the house, with a little water-cart. People living  in England, in almost perpetual mildness and moisture, don’t really know  what a drought is. If they have some weeks of cloudless weather, it is  generally preceded and followed by good rains; but we have perhaps an  hour’s shower every week, and then comes a month or six weeks’ drought.  The soil is very light, and dries so quickly that, after the heaviest  thunder-shower, I can walk over any of my paths in my thin shoes; and to  keep the garden even moderately damp it should pour with rain regularly  every day for three hours. My only means of getting water is to go to  the pump near the house, or to the little stream that forms my eastern  boundary, and the little stream dries up too unless there has been rain,  and is at the best of times difficult to get at, having steep banks  covered with forget-me-nots. I possess one moist, peaty bit of ground,  and that is to be planted with silver birches in imitation of the  Hirschwald, and is to be carpeted between the birches with flaming  azaleas. All the rest of my soil is sandy--the soil for pines and  acacias, but not the soil for roses; yet see what love will do--there  are more roses in my garden than any other flower! Next spring the bare  places are to be filled with trees that I have ordered: pines behind the  delicate acacias, and startling mountain-ashes, oaks, copper-beeches,  maples, larches, juniper-trees--was it not Elijah who sat down to rest  under a juniper-tree? I have often wondered how he managed to get under  it. It is a compact little tree, not more than two to three yards high  here, and all closely squeezed up together. Perhaps they grew more  aggressively where he was. By the time the babies have grown old and  disagreeable it will be very pretty here, and then possibly they won’t  like it; and, if they have inherited the Man of Wrath’s indifference to  gardens, they will let it run wild and leave it to return to the state  in which I found it. Or perhaps their three husbands will refuse to live  in it, or to come to such a lonely place at all, and then of course its  fate is sealed. My only comfort is that husbands don’t flourish in the  desert, and that the three will have to wait a long time before enough  are found to go round. Mothers tell me that it is a dreadful business  finding one husband; how much more painful then to have to look for  three at once!--the babies are so nearly the same age that they only  just escaped being twins. But I won’t look. I can imagine nothing more  uncomfortable than a son-in-law, and besides, I don’t think a husband is  at all a good thing for a girl to have. I shall do my best in the years  at my disposal to train them so to love the garden, and out-door life,  and even farming, that, if they have a spark of their mother in them,  they will want and ask for nothing better. My hope of success is however  exceedingly small, and there is probably a fearful period in store for  me when I shall be taken every day during the winter to the distant  towns to balls--a poor old mother shivering in broad daylight in her  party gown, and being made to start after an early lunch and not  getting home till breakfast-time next morning. Indeed, they have already  developed an alarming desire to go to “partings” as they call them, the  April baby announcing her intention of beginning to do so when she is  twelve. “Are you twelve, Mummy?” she asked.    The gardener is leaving on the first of April, and I am trying to find  another. It is grievous changing so often--in two years I shall have  had three--because at each change a great part of my plants and plans  necessarily suffers. Seeds get lost, seedlings are not pricked out in  time, places already sown are planted with something else, and there  is confusion out of doors and despair in my heart. But he was to have  married the cook, and the cook saw a ghost and immediately left, and he  is going after her as soon as he can, and meanwhile is wasting visibly  away. What she saw was doors that are locked opening with a great  clatter all by themselves on the hingeside, and then somebody invisible  cursed at her. These phenomena now go by the name of “the ghost.” She  asked to be allowed to leave at once, as she had never been in a place  where there was a ghost before. I suggested that she should try and get  used to it; but she thought it would be wasting time, and she looked so  ill that I let her go, and the garden has to suffer. I don’t know why  it should be given to cooks to see such interesting things and withheld  from me, but I have had two others since she left, and they both have  seen the ghost. Minora grows very silent as bed-time approaches, and  relents towards Irais and myself; and, after having shown us all day how  little she approves us, when the bedroom candles are brought she quite  begins to cling. She has once or twice anxiously inquired whether Irais  is sure she does not object to sleeping alone.    “If you are at all nervous, I will come and keep you company,” she said;  “I don’t mind at all, I assure you.”    But Irais is not to be taken in by such simple wiles, and has told me  she would rather sleep with fifty ghosts than with one Minora.    Since Miss Jones was so unexpectedly called away to her parent’s bedside  I have seen a good deal of the babies; and it is so nice without a  governess that I would put off engaging another for a year or two, if it  were not that I should in so doing come within the reach of the arm of  the law, which is what every German spends his life in trying to avoid.  The April baby will be six next month, and, after her sixth birthday  is passed, we are liable at any moment to receive a visit from a school  inspector, who will inquire curiously into the state of her education,  and, if it is not up to the required standard, all sorts of fearful  things might happen to the guilty parents, probably beginning with  fines, and going on crescendo to dungeons if, owing to gaps between  governesses and difficulties in finding the right one, we persisted in  our evil courses. Shades of the prison-house begin to close here upon  the growing boy, and prisons compass the Teuton about on every side  all through life to such an extent that he has to walk very delicately  indeed if he would stay outside them and pay for their maintenance.  Cultured individuals do not, as a rule, neglect to teach their offspring  to read, and write, and say their prayers, and are apt to resent the  intrusion of an examining inspector into their homes; but it does  not much matter after all, and I daresay it is very good for us to be  worried; indeed, a philosopher of my acquaintance declares that people  who are not regularly and properly worried are never any good for  anything. In the eye of the law we are all sinners, and every man is  held to be guilty until he has proved that he is innocent.    Minora has seen so much of the babies that, after vainly trying to  get out of their way for several days, she thought it better to resign  herself, and make the best of it by regarding them as copy, and using  them to fill a chapter in her book. So she took to dogging their  footsteps wherever they went, attended their uprisings and their lyings  down, engaged them, if she could, in intelligent conversation, went with  them into the garden to study their ways when they were sleighing, drawn  by a big dog, and generally made their lives a burden to them. This went  on for three days, and then she settled down to write the result with  the Man of Wrath’s typewriter, borrowed whenever her notes for any  chapter have reached the state of ripeness necessary for the process  she describes as “throwing into form.” She writes everything with a  typewriter, even her private letters.    “Don’t forget to put in something about a mother’s knee,” said Irais;  “you can’t write effectively about children without that.” “Oh, of  course I shall mention that,” replied Minora.    “And pink toes,” I added. “There are always toes, and they are never  anything but pink.”    “I have that somewhere,” said Minora, turning over her notes.    “But, after all, babies are not a German speciality,” said Irais, “and I  don’t quite see why you should bring them into a book of German travels.  Elizabeth’s babies have each got the fashionable number of arms and  legs, and are exactly the same as English ones.”    “Oh, but they can’t be just the same, you know,” said Minora, looking  worried. “It must make a difference living here in this place, and  eating such odd things, and never having a doctor, and never being ill.  Children who have never had measles and those things can’t be quite the  same as other children; it must all be in their systems and can’t get  out for some reason or other. And a child brought up on chicken and  rice-pudding must be different to a child that eats Spickgans and liver  sausages. And they are different; I can’t tell in what way, but  they certainly are; and I think if I steadily describe them from the  materials I have collected the last three days, I may perhaps hit on the  points of difference.”    “Why bother about points of difference?” asked Irais. “I should write  some little thing, bringing in the usual parts of the picture, such as  knees and toes, and make it mildly pathetic.”    “But it is by no means an easy thing for me to do,” said Minora  plaintively; “I have so little experience of children.”    “Then why write it at all?” asked that sensible person Elizabeth.    “I have as little experience as you,” said Irais, “because I have no  children; but if you don’t yearn after startling originality, nothing is  easier than to write bits about them. I believe I could do a dozen in an  hour.”    She sat down at the writing-table, took up an old letter, and scribbled  for about five minutes. “There,” she said, throwing it to Minora, “you  may have it--pink toes and all complete.”    Minora put on her eye-glasses and read aloud:    “When my baby shuts her eyes and sings her hymns at bed-time my stale  and battered soul is filled with awe. All sorts of vague memories crowd  into my mind--memories of my own mother and myself--how many years  ago!--of the sweet helplessness of being gathered up half asleep in her  arms, and undressed, and put in my cot, without being wakened; of the  angels I believed in; of little children coming straight from heaven,  and still being surrounded, so long as they were good, by the shadow of  white wings,--all the dear poetic nonsense learned, just as my baby is  learning it, at her mother’s knee. She has not an idea of the beauty  of the charming things she is told, and stares wide-eyed, with heavenly  eyes, while her mother talks of the heaven she has so lately come from,  and is relieved and comforted by the interrupting bread and milk. At two  years old she does not understand angels, and does understand bread and  milk; at five she has vague notions about them, and prefers bread and  milk; at ten both bread and milk and angels have been left behind in  the nursery, and she has already found out that they are luxuries not  necessary to her everyday life. In later years she may be disinclined to  accept truths second-hand, insist on thinking for herself, be earnest in  her desire to shake off exploded traditions, be untiring in her efforts  to live according to a high moral standard and to be strong, and pure,  and good--”    “Like tea,” explained Irais.    “--yet will she never, with all her virtues, possess one-thousandth part  of the charm that clung about her when she sang, with quiet eyelids, her  first reluctant hymns, kneeling on her mother’s knees. I love to come in  at bed-time and sit in the window in the setting sunshine watching the  mysteries of her going to bed. Her mother tubs her, for she is far too  precious to be touched by any nurse, and then she is rolled up in a  big bath towel, and only her little pink toes peep out; and when she is  powdered, and combed, and tied up in her night-dress, and all her curls  are on end, and her ears glowing, she is knelt down on her mother’s lap,  a little bundle of fragrant flesh, and her face reflects the quiet of  her mother’s face as she goes through her evening prayer for pity and  for peace.”    “How very curious!” said Minora, when she had finished. “That is exactly  what I was going to say.”    “Oh, then I have saved you the trouble of putting it together; you can  copy that if you like.” “But have you a stale soul, Miss Minora?” I  asked.    “Well, do you know, I rather think that is a good touch,” she replied;  “it will make people really think a man wrote the book. You know I am  going to take a man’s name.”    “That is precisely what I imagined,” said Irais. “You will call yourself  John Jones, or George Potts, or some such sternly commonplace name, to  emphasise your uncompromising attitude towards all feminine weaknesses,  and no one will be taken in.”    “I really think, Elizabeth,” said Irais to me later, when the click of  Minora’s typewriter was heard hesitating in the next room, “that you and  I are writing her book for her. She takes down everything we say. Why  does she copy all that about the baby? I wonder why mothers’ knees are  supposed to be touching? I never learned anything at them, did you? But  then in my case they were only stepmother’s, and nobody ever sings their  praises.”    “My mother was always at parties,” I said; “and the nurse made me say my  prayers in French.”    “And as for tubs and powder,” went on Irais, “when I was a baby such  things were not the fashion. There were never any bathrooms, and no  tubs; our faces and hands were washed, and there was a foot-bath in the  room, and in the summer we had a bath and were put to bed afterwards for  fear we might catch cold. My stepmother didn’t worry much; she used to  wear pink dresses all over lace, and the older she got the prettier the  dresses got. When is she going?”    “Who? Minora? I haven’t asked her that.”    “Then I will. It is really bad for her art to be neglected like this.  She has been here an unconscionable time,--it must be nearly three  weeks.”    “Yes, she came the same day you did,” I said pleasantly.    Irais was silent. I hope she was reflecting that it is not worse to  neglect one’s art than one’s husband, and her husband is lying all this  time stretched on a bed of sickness, while she is spending her days so  agreeably with me. She has a way of forgetting that she has a home, or  any other business in the world than just to stay on chatting with me,  and reading, and singing, and laughing at any one there is to laugh at,  and kissing the babies, and tilting with the Man of Wrath. Naturally I  love her--she is so pretty that anybody with eyes in his head must love  her--but too much of anything is bad, and next month the passages and  offices are to be whitewashed, and people who have ever whitewashed  their houses inside know what nice places they are to live in while it  is being done; and there will be no dinner for Irais, and none of those  succulent salads full of caraway seeds that she so devotedly loves. I  shall begin to lead her thoughts gently back to her duties by inquiring  every day anxiously after her husband’s health. She is not very fond of  him, because he does not run and hold the door open for her every time  she gets up to leave the room; and though she has asked him to do so,  and told him how much she wishes he would, he still won’t. She stayed  once in a house where there was an Englishman, and his nimbleness in  regard to doors and chairs so impressed her that her husband has had no  peace since, and each time she has to go out of a room she is reminded  of her disregarded wishes, so that a shut door is to her symbolic of the  failure of her married life, and the very sight of one makes her wonder  why she was born; at least, that is what she told me once, in a burst  of confidence. He is quite a nice, harmless little man, pleasant to talk  to, good-tempered, and full of fun; but he thinks he is too old to begin  to learn new and uncomfortable ways, and he has that horror of being  made better by his wife that distinguishes so many righteous men, and  is shared by the Man of Wrath, who persists in holding his glass in  his left hand at meals, because if he did not (and I don’t believe he  particularly likes doing it) his relations might say that marriage  has improved him, and thus drive the iron into his soul. This habit  occasions an almost daily argument between one or other of the babies  and myself.    “April, hold your glass in your right hand.”    “But papa doesn’t.”    “When you are as old as papa you can do as you like.”    Which was embellished only yesterday by Minora adding impressively, “And  only think how strange it would look if everybody held their glasses  so.”    April was greatly struck by the force of this proposition.      January 28th.--It is very cold,--fifteen degrees of frost Reaumur, but  perfectly delicious, still, bright weather, and one feels jolly and  energetic and amiably disposed towards everybody. The two young ladies  are still here, but the air is so buoyant that even they don’t weigh on  me any longer, and besides, they have both announced their approaching  departure, so that after all I shall get my whitewashing done in peace,  and the house will have on its clean pinafore in time to welcome the  spring.    Minora has painted my portrait, and is going to present it as a parting  gift to the Man of Wrath; and the fact that I let her do it, and sat  meekly times innumerable, proves conclusively, I hope, that I am not  vain. When Irais first saw it she laughed till she cried, and at once  commissioned her to paint hers, so that she may take it away with her  and give it to her husband on his birthday, which happens to be early in  February. Indeed, if it were not for this birthday, I really think she  would have forgotten to go at all; but birthdays are great and solemn  festivals with us, never allowed to slip by unnoticed, and always  celebrated in the presence of a sympathetic crowd of relations (gathered  from far and near to tell you how well you are wearing, and that nobody  would ever dream, and that really it is wonderful), who stand round  a sort of sacrificial altar, on which your years are offered up as  a burnt-offering to the gods in the shape of lighted pink and white  candles, stuck in a very large, flat, jammy cake. The cake with its  candles is the chief feature, and on the table round it lie the gifts  each person present is more or less bound to give. As my birthday  falls in the winter I get mittens as well as blotting-books and  photograph-frames, and if it were in the summer I should get  photograph-frames and blotting-books and no mittens; but whatever the  present may be, and by whomsoever given, it has to be welcomed with the  noisiest gratitude, and loudest exclamations of joy, and such words as  entzuckend, reizend, herrlich, wundervoll, and suss repeated over and  over again, until the unfortunate Geburtstagskind feels indeed that  another year has gone, and that she has grown older, and wiser, and more  tired of folly and of vain repetitions. A flag is hoisted, and all  the morning the rites are celebrated, the cake eaten, healths drunk,  speeches made, and hands nearly shaken off. The neighbouring parsons  drive up, and when nobody is looking their wives count the candles in  the cake; the active lady in the next Schlass spares time to send a pot  of flowers, and to look up my age in the Gotha Almanach; a deputation  comes from the farms headed by the chief inspector in white kid gloves  who invokes Heaven’s blessings on the gracious lady’s head; and the  babies are enchanted, and sit in a corner trying on all the mittens.  In the evening there is a dinner for the relations and the chief local  authorities, with more health-drinking and speechifying, and the next  morning, when I come downstairs thankful to have done with it, I  am confronted by the altar still in its place, cake crumbs and  candle-grease and all, because any hasty removal of it would imply a  most lamentable want of sentiment, deplorable in anybody, but scandalous  and disgusting in a tender female. All birthdays are observed in this  fashion, and not a few wise persons go for a short trip just about the  time theirs is due, and I think I shall imitate them next year; only  trips to the country or seaside in December are not usually pleasant,  and if I go to a town there are sure to be relations in it, and then  the cake will spring up mushroom-like from the teeming soil of their  affection.    I hope it has been made evident in these pages how superior Irais and  myself are to the ordinary weaknesses of mankind; if any further proof  were needed, it is furnished by the fact that we both, in defiance of  tradition, scorn this celebration of birthday rites. Years ago, when  first I knew her, and long before we were either of us married, I sent  her a little brass candlestick on her birthday; and when mine followed a  few months later, she sent me a note-book. No notes were written in it,  and on her next birthday I presented it to her; she thanked me profusely  in the customary manner, and when my turn came I received the brass  candlestick. Since then we alternately enjoy the possession of each of  these articles, and the present question is comfortably settled once  and for all, at a minimum of trouble and expense. We never mention this  little arrangement except at the proper time, when we send a letter of  fervid thanks.    This radiant weather, when mere living is a joy, and sitting still over  the fire out of the question, has been going on for more than a week.  Sleighing and skating have been our chief occupation, especially  skating, which is more than usually fascinating here, because the place  is intersected by small canals communicating with a lake and the river  belonging to the lake, and as everything is frozen black and hard, we  can skate for miles straight ahead without being obliged to turn round  and come back again,--at all times an annoying, and even mortifying,  proceeding. Irais skates beautifully: modesty is the only obstacle to my  saying the same of myself; but I may remark that all Germans skate well,  for the simple reason that every year of their lives, for three or four  months, they may do it as much as they like. Minora was astonished and  disconcerted by finding herself left behind, and arriving at the place  where tea meets us half an hour after we had finished. In some places  the banks of the canals are so high that only our heads appear level  with the fields, and it is, as Minora noted in her book, a curious sight  to see three female heads skimming along apparently by themselves,  and enjoying it tremendously. When the banks are low, we appear to be  gliding deliciously over the roughest ploughed fields, with or without  legs according to circumstances. Before we start, I fix on the place  where tea and a sleigh are to meet us, and we drive home again;  because skating against the wind is as detestable as skating with it  is delightful, and an unkind Nature arranges its blowing without the  smallest regard for our convenience. Yesterday, by way of a change, we  went for a picnic to the shores of the Baltic, ice-bound at this  season, and utterly desolate at our nearest point. I have a weakness for  picnics, especially in winter, when the mosquitoes cease from troubling  and the ant-hills are at rest; and of all my many favourite picnic  spots this one on the Baltic is the loveliest and best. As it is a  three-hours’ drive, the Man of Wrath is loud in his lamentations when  the special sort of weather comes which means, as experience has taught  him, this particular excursion. There must be deep snow, hard frost,  no wind, and a cloudless sky; and when, on waking up, I see these  conditions fulfilled, then it would need some very potent reason to keep  me from having out a sleigh and going off. It is, I admit, a hard day  for the horses; but why have horses if they are not to take you where  you want to go to, and at the time you want to go? And why should  not horses have hard days as well as everybody else? The Man of Wrath  loathes picnics, and has no eye for nature and frozen seas, and is  simply bored by a long drive through a forest that does not belong to  him; a single turnip on his own place is more admirable in his eyes than  the tallest, pinkest, straightest pi",32.43,13.8,20.4,8.72,23.1,7.34,1506,12.2,22.22,11th and 12th grade
18,The Tinker’s Weddingr,"uneasy._—What is it yourself knows of the fine ladies  when they wouldn’t let the like of you go near them at all?    MARY  If you do be drinking a little sup in one town and another town, it’s  soon you get great knowledge and a great sight into the world. You’ll  see men there, and women there, sitting up on the ends of barrels in  the dark night, and they making great talk would soon have the like of  you, Sarah Casey, as wise as a March hare.    MICHAEL  _to Sarah._—That’s the truth she’s saying, and maybe if you’ve sense in  you at all, you’d have a right still to leave your fooling, and not be  wasting our gold.    SARAH  _decisively._—If it’s wise or fool I am, I’ve made a good bargain and  I’ll stand to it now.    MARY  What is it he’s making you give?    MICHAEL  The ten shillings in gold, and the tin can is above tied in the sack.    MARY  _looking at the bundle with surprise and dread._—The bit of gold and  the tin can, is it?    MICHAEL  The half a sovereign, and the gallon can.    MARY  _scrambling to her feet quickly._—Well, I think I’ll be walking off the  road to the fair the way you won’t be destroying me going too fast on  the hills. _(She goes a few steps towards the left, then turns and  speaks to Sarah very persuasively._) Let you not take the can from the  sack, Sarah Casey; for the people is coming above would be making game  of you, and pointing their fingers if they seen you do the like of  that. Let you leave it safe in the bag, I’m saying, Sarah darling. It’s  that way will be best.    [_She goes towards left, and pauses for a moment, looking about her  with embarrassment._    MICHAEL  _in a low voice._—What ails her at all?    SARAH  _anxiously._—It’s real wicked she does be when you hear her speaking as  easy as that.    MARY  _to herself._—I’d be safer in the chapel, I’m thinking; for if she  caught me after on the road, maybe she would kill me then.    [_She comes hobbling back towards the right._    SARAH  Where is it you’re going? It isn’t that way we’ll be walking to the  fair.    MARY  I’m going up into the chapel to give you my blessing and hear the  priest saying his prayers. It’s a lonesome road is running below to  Greenane, and a woman would never know the things might happen her and  she walking single in a lonesome place.    [_As she reaches the chapel-gate, the Priest comes to it in his  surplice._    PRIEST  _crying out._—Come along now. It is the whole day you’d keep me here  saying my prayers, and I getting my death with not a bit in my stomach,  and my breakfast in ruins, and the Lord Bishop maybe driving on the  road to-day?    SARAH  We’re coming now, holy father.    PRIEST  Give me the bit of gold into my hand.    SARAH  It’s here, holy father.    [_She gives it to him. Michael takes the bundle from the ditch and  brings it over, standing a little behind Sarah. He feels the bundle,  and looks at Mary with a meaning look._    PRIEST  _looking at the gold._—It’s a good one, I’m thinking, wherever you got  it. And where is the can?    SARAH  _taking the bundle._—We have it here in a bit of clean sack, your  reverence. We tied it up in the inside of that to keep it from rusting  in the dews of night, and let you not open it now or you’ll have the  people making game of us and telling the story on us, east and west to  the butt of the hills.    PRIEST  _taking the bundle._—Give it here into my hand, Sarah Casey. What is it  any person would think of a tinker making a can.    [_He begins opening the bundle._    SARAH  It’s a fine can, your reverence. for if it’s poor simple people we are,  it’s fine cans we can make, and himself, God help him, is a great man  surely at the trade.    [_Priest opens the bundle; the three empty bottles fall out._    SARAH  Glory to the saints of joy!    PRIEST  Did ever any man see the like of that? To think you’d be putting deceit  on me, and telling lies to me, and I going to marry you for a little  sum wouldn’t marry a child.    SARAH  _crestfallen and astonished._—It’s the divil did it, your reverence,  and I wouldn’t tell you a lie. _(Raising her hands.)_ May the Lord  Almighty strike me dead if the divil isn’t after hooshing the tin can  from the bag.    PRIEST  _vehemently._—Go along now, and don’t be swearing your lies. Go along  now, and let you not be thinking I’m big fool enough to believe the  like of that, when it’s after selling it you are or making a swap for  drink of it, maybe, in the darkness of the night.    MARY  _in a peacemaking voice, putting her hand on the Priest’s left  arm._—She wouldn’t do the like of that, your reverence, when she hasn’t  a decent standing drouth on her at all; and she’s setting great store  on her marriage the way you’d have a right to be taking her easy, and  not minding the can. What differ would an empty can make with a fine,  rich, hardy man the like of you?    SARAH  _imploringly._—Marry us, your reverence, for the ten shillings in gold,  and we’ll make you a grand can in the evening—a can would be fit to  carry water for the holy man of God. Marry us now and I’ll be saying  fine prayers for you, morning and night, if it’d be raining itself, and  it’d be in two black pools I’d be setting my knees.    PRIEST  _loudly._—It’s a wicked, thieving, lying, scheming lot you are, the  pack of you. Let you walk off now and take every stinking rag you have  there from the ditch.    MARY  _putting her shawl over her head._—Marry her, your reverence, for the  love of God, for there’ll be queer doings below if you send her off the  like of that and she swearing crazy on the road.    SARAH  _angrily._—It’s the truth she’s saying; for it’s herself, I’m thinking,  is after swapping the tin can for a pint, the time she was raging mad  with the drouth, and ourselves above walking the hill.    MARY  _crying out with indignation._—Have you no shame, Sarah Casey, to tell  lies unto a holy man?    SARAH  _to Mary, working herself into a rage._—It’s making game of me you’d  be, and putting a fool’s head on me in the face of the world; but if  you were thinking to be mighty cute walking off, or going up to hide in  the church, I’ve got you this time, and you’ll not run from me now.    _She seizes up one of the bottles._    MARY  _hiding behind the priest._—Keep her off, your reverence, keep her off  for the love of the Almighty God. What at all would the Lord Bishop say  if he found me here lying with my head broken across, or the two of  yous maybe digging a bloody grave for me at the door of the church?    PRIEST  _waving Sarah off._—Go along, Sarah Casey. Would you be doing murder at  my feet? Go along from me now, and wasn’t I a big fool to have to do  with you when it’s nothing but distraction and torment I get from the  kindness of my heart?    SARAH  _shouting._—I’ve bet a power of strong lads east and west through the  world, and are you thinking I’d turn back from a priest? Leave the road  now, or maybe I would strike yourself.    PRIEST  You would not, Sarah Casey. I’ve no fear for the lot of you; but let  you walk off, I’m saying, and not be coming where you’ve no business,  and screeching tumult and murder at the doorway of the church.    SARAH  I’ll not go a step till I have her head broke, or till I’m wed with  himself. If you want to get shut of us, let you marry us now, for I’m  thinking the ten shillings in gold is a good price for the like of you,  and you near burst with the fat.    PRIEST  I wouldn’t have you coming in on me and soiling my church; for there’s  nothing at all, I’m thinking, would keep the like of you from hell.  _(He throws down the ten shillings on the ground.)_ Gather up your gold  now, and begone from my sight, for if ever I set an eye on you again  you’ll hear me telling the peelers who it was stole the black ass  belonging to Philly O’Cullen, and whose hay it is the grey ass does be  eating.    SARAH  You’d do that?    PRIEST  I would, surely.    SARAH  If you do, you’ll be getting all the tinkers from Wicklow and Wexford,  and the County Meath, to put up block tin in the place of glass to  shield your windows where you do be looking out and blinking at the  girls. It’s hard set you’ll be that time, I’m telling you, to fill the  depth of your belly the long days of Lent; for we wouldn’t leave a  laying pullet in your yard at all.    PRIEST  _losing his temper finally._—Go on, now, or I’ll send the Lords of  Justice a dated story of your villainies—burning, stealing, robbing,  raping to this mortal day. Go on now, I’m saying, if you’d run from  Kilmainham or the rope itself.    MICHAEL  _taking off his coat._—Is it run from the like of you, holy father? Go  up to your own shanty, or I’ll beat you with the ass’s reins till the  world would hear you roaring from this place to the coast of Clare.    PRIEST  Is it lift your hand upon myself when the Lord would blight your  members if you’d touch me now? Go on from this.    [_He gives him a shove._    MICHAEL  Blight me is it? Take it then, your reverence, and God help you so.    [_He runs at him with the reins._    PRIEST  _runs up to ditch crying out._—There are the peelers passing by the  grace of God—hey, below!    MARY  _clapping her hand over his mouth._—Knock him down on the road; they  didn’t hear him at all.    [_Michael pulls him down._    SARAH  Gag his jaws.    MARY  Stuff the sacking in his teeth.    [_They gag him with the sack that had the can in it._    SARAH  Tie the bag around his head, and if the peelers come, we’ll put him  head-first in the boghole is beyond the ditch.    [_They tie him up in some sacking._    MICHAEL  _to Mary._—Keep him quiet, and the rags tight on him for fear he’d  screech. _(He goes back to their camp.)_ Hurry with the things, Sarah  Casey. The peelers aren’t coming this way, and maybe we’ll get off from  them now.    [_They bundle the things together in wild haste, the priest wriggling  and struggling about on the ground, with old Mary trying to keep him  quiet._    MARY  _patting his head._—Be quiet, your reverence. What is it ails you, with  your wrigglings now? Is it choking maybe? _(She puts her hand under the  sack, and feels his mouth, patting him on the back.)_ It’s only letting  on you are, holy father, for your nose is blowing back and forward as  easy as an east wind on an April day. _(In a soothing voice.)_ There  now, holy father, let you stay easy, I’m telling you, and learn a  little sense and patience, the way you’ll not be so airy again going to  rob poor sinners of their scraps of gold. _(He gets quieter.)_ That’s a  good boy you are now, your reverence, and let you not be uneasy, for we  wouldn’t hurt you at all. It’s sick and sorry we are to tease you; but  what did you want meddling with the like of us, when it’s a long time  we are going our own ways—father and son, and his son after him, or  mother and daughter, and her own daughter again—and it’s little need we  ever had of going up into a church and swearing—I’m told there’s  swearing with it—a word no man would believe, or with drawing rings on  our fingers, would be cutting our skins maybe when we’d be taking the  ass from the shafts, and pulling the straps the time they’d be slippy  with going around beneath the heavens in rains falling.    MICHAEL  _who has finished bundling up the things, comes over to Sarah._—We’re  fixed now; and I have a mind to run him in a boghole the way he’ll not  be tattling to the peelers of our games to-day.    SARAH  You’d have a right too, I’m thinking.    MARY  _soothingly._—Let you not be rough with him, Sarah Casey, and he after  drinking his sup of porter with us at the fall of night. Maybe he’d  swear a mighty oath he wouldn’t harm us, and then we’d safer loose him;  for if we went to drown him, they’d maybe hang the batch of us, man and  child and woman, and the ass itself.    MICHAEL  What would he care for an oath?    MARY  Don’t you know his like do live in terror of the wrath of God?  _(Putting her mouth to the Priest’s ear in the sacking.)_ Would you  swear an oath, holy father, to leave us in our freedom, and not talk at  all? _(Priest nods in sacking.)_ Didn’t I tell you? Look at the poor  fellow nodding his head off in the bias of the sacks. Strip them off  from him, and he’ll be easy now.    MICHAEL  _as if speaking to a horse._—Hold up, holy father.    [_He pulls the sacking off, and shows the priest with his hair on end.  They free his mouth._    MARY  Hold him till he swears.    PRIEST  _in a faint voice._—I swear surely. If you let me go in peace, I’ll not  inform against you or say a thing at all, and may God forgive me for  giving heed unto your like to-day.    SARAH  _puts the ring on his finger._—There’s the ring, holy father, to keep  you minding of your oath until the end of time; for my heart’s scalded  with your fooling; and it’ll be a long day till I go making talk of  marriage or the like of that.    MARY  _complacently, standing up slowly._—She’s vexed now, your reverence;  and let you not mind her at all, for she’s right surely, and it’s  little need we ever had of the like of you to get us our bit to eat,  and our bit to drink, and our time of love when we were young men and  women, and were fine to look at.    MICHAEL  Hurry on now. He’s a great man to have kept us from fooling our gold;  and we’ll have a great time drinking that bit with the trampers on the  green of Clash.    [_They gather up their things. The priest stands up._    PRIEST  _lifting up his hand._—I’ve sworn not to call the hand of man upon your  crimes to-day; but I haven’t sworn I wouldn’t call the fire of heaven  from the hand of the Almighty God.    [_He begins saying a Latin malediction in a loud ecclesiastical voice._    MARY  There’s an old villain.    ALL  _together._—Run, run. Run for your lives.    [_They rush out, leaving the Priest master of the situation._    CURTAIN          End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Tinker’s Wedding, by J. M.

19,A Voyage to Arcturusr," too. And so Surtur does really exist, and my  journey stands for something. But why am I here, and what can I do? Who  is Surtur? Where is he to be found?”    Something wild came into his eyes.    “What did Dreamsinter mean by his ‘Not you, but Nightspore’? Am I a  secondary character—is he regarded as important; and I as unimportant?  Where is Nightspore, and what is he doing? Am I to wait for his time and  pleasure—can I originate nothing?”    He continued sitting up, with straight-extended legs.    “I must make up my mind that this is a strange journey, and that the  strangest things will happen in it. It’s no use making plans, for I  can’t see two steps ahead—everything is unknown. But one thing’s  evident: nothing but the wildest audacity will carry me through, and I  must sacrifice everything else to that. And therefore if Surtur shows  himself again, I shall go forward to meet him, even if it means death.”    Through the black, quiet aisles of the forest the drum beats came again.  The sound was a long way off and very faint. It was like the last  mutterings of thunder after a heavy storm. Maskull listened, without  getting up. The drumming faded into silence, and did not return.    He smiled queerly, and said aloud, “Thanks, Surtur! I accept the omen.”    When he was about to get up, he found that the shrivelled skin that had  been his third arm was flapping disconcertingly with every movement of  his body. He made perforations in it all around, as close to his chest  as possible, with the fingernails of both hands; then he carefully  twisted it off. In that world of rapid growth and ungrowth he judged  that the stump would soon disappear. After that, he rose and peered into  the darkness.    The forest at that point sloped rather steeply and, without thinking  twice about it, he took the downhill direction, never doubting it would  bring him somewhere. As soon as he started walking, his temper became  gloomy and morose—he was shaken, tired, dirty, and languid with hunger;  moreover, he realised that the walk was not going to be a short one. Be  that as it may, he determined to sit down no more until the whole dismal  forest was at his back.    One after another the shadowy, houselike trees were observed, avoided,  and passed. Far overhead the little patch of glowing sky was still  always visible; otherwise he had no clue to the time of day. He  continued tramping sullenly down the slope for many damp, slippery  miles—in some places through bogs. When, presently, the twilight seemed  to thin, he guessed that the open world was not far away. The forest  grew more palpable and grey, and now he saw its majesty better. The tree  trunks were like round towers, and so wide were the intervals that they  resembled natural amphitheatres. He could not make out the colour of the  bark. Everything he saw amazed him, but his admiration was of the  growling, grudging kind. The difference in light between the forest  behind him and the forest ahead became so marked that he could no longer  doubt that he was on the point of coming out.    Real light was in front of him; looking back, he found he had a shadow.  The trunks acquired a reddish tint. He quickened his pace. As the  minutes went by, the bright patch ahead grew luminous and vivid; it had  a tinge of blue. He also imagined that he heard the sound of surf.    All that part of the forest toward which he was moving became rich with  colour. The boles of the trees were of a deep, dark red; their leaves,  high above his head, were ulfire-hued; the dead leaves on the ground  were of a colour he could not name. At the same time he discovered the  use of his third eye. By adding a third angle to his sight, every object  he looked at stood out in greater relief. The world looked less  flat—more realistic and significant. He had a stronger attraction toward  his surroundings; he seemed somehow to lose his egotism, and to become  free and thoughtful.    Now through the last trees he saw full daylight. Less than half a mile  separated him from the border of the forest, and, eager to discover what  lay beyond, he broke into a run. He heard the surf louder. It was a  peculiar hissing sound that could proceed only from water, yet was  unlike the sea. Almost immediately he came within sight of an enormous  horizon of dancing waves, which he knew must be the Sinking Sea. He fell  back into a quick walk, continuing to stare hard. The wind that met him  was hot, fresh and sweet.    When he arrived at the final fringe of forest, which joined the wide  sands of the shore without any change of level, he leaned with his back  to a great tree and gazed his fill, motionless, at what lay in front of  him. The sands continued east and west in a straight line, broken only  here and there by a few creeks. They were of a brilliant orange colour,  but there were patches of violet. The forest appeared to stand sentinel  over the shore for its entire length. Everything else was sea and sky—he  had never seen so much water. The semicircle of the skyline was so vast  that he might have imagined himself on a flat world, with a range of  vision determined only by the power of his eye. The sea was unlike any  sea on Earth. It resembled an immense liquid opal. On a body colour of  rich, magnificent emerald-green, flashes of red, yellow, and blue were  everywhere shooting up and vanishing. The wave motion was extraordinary.  Pinnacles of water were slowly formed until they attained a height of  perhaps ten or twenty feet, when they would suddenly sink downward and  outward, creating in their descent a series of concentric rings for long  distances around them. Quickly moving currents, like rivers in the sea,  could be seen, racing away from land; they were of a darker green and  bore no pinnacles. Where the sea met the shore, the waves rushed over  the sands far in, with almost sinister rapidity—accompanied by a weird,  hissing, spitting sound, which was what Maskull had heard. The green  tongues rolled in without foam.    About twenty miles distant, as he judged, directly opposite him, a long,  low island stood up from the sea, black and not distinguished in  outline. It was Swaylone’s Island. Maskull was less interested in that  than in the blue sunset that glowed behind its back. Alppain had set,  but the whole northern sky was plunged into the minor key by its  afterlight. Branchspell in the zenith was white and overpowering, the  day was cloudless and terrifically hot; but where the blue sun had sunk,  a sombre shadow seemed to overhang the world. Maskull had a feeling of  disintegration—just as if two chemically distinct forces were  simultaneously acting upon the cells of his body. Since the afterglow of  Alppain affected him like this, he thought it more than likely that he  would never be able to face that sun itself, and go on living. Still,  some modification might happen to him that would make it possible.    The sea tempted him. He made up his mind to bathe, and at once walked  toward the shore. The instant he stepped outside the shadow line of the  forest trees, the blinding rays of the sun beat down on him so savagely  that for a few minutes he felt sick and his head swam. He trod quickly  across the sands. The orange-coloured parts were nearly hot enough to  roast food, he judged, but the violet parts were like fire itself. He  stepped on a patch in ignorance, and immediately jumped high into the  air with a startled yell.    The sea was voluptuously warm. It would not bear his weight, so he  determined to try swimming. First of all he stripped off his skin  garment, washed it thoroughly with sand and water, and laid it in the  sun to dry. Then he scrubbed himself as well as he could and washed out  his beard and hair. After that, he waded in a long way, until the water  reached his breast, and took to swimming—avoiding the spouts as far as  possible He found it no pastime. The water was everywhere of unequal  density. In some places he could swim, in others he could barely save  himself from drowning, in others again he could not force himself  beneath the surface at all. There were no outward signs to show what the  water ahead held in store for him. The whole business was most  dangerous.    He came out, feeling clean and invigorated. For a time he walked up and  down the sands, drying himself in the hot sunshine and looking around  him. He was a naked stranger in a huge, foreign, mystical world, and  whichever way he turned, unknown and threatening forces were glaring at  him. The gigantic, white, withering Branchspell, the awful, body-  changing Alppain, the beautiful, deadly, treacherous sea, the dark and  eerie Swaylone’s Island, the spirit-crushing forest out of which he had  just escaped—to all these mighty powers, surrounding him on every side,  what resources had he, a feeble, ignorant traveller from a tiny planet  on the other side of space, to oppose, to avoid being utterly  destroyed?... Then he smiled to himself. “I’ve already been here two  days, and still I survive. I have luck—and with that one can balance the  universe. But what is luck—a verbal expression, or a thing?”    As he was putting on his skin, which was now dry, the answer came to  him, and this time he was grave. “Surtur brought me here, and Surtur is  watching over me. That is my ‘luck.’... But what is Surtur in this  world?... How is he able to protect me against the blind and  ungovernable forces of nature? Is he stronger than Nature?...”    Hungry as he was for food, he was hungrier still for human society, for  he wished to inquire about all these things. He asked himself which way  he should turn his steps. There were only two ways; along the shore,  either east or west. The nearest creek lay to the east, cutting the  sands about a mile away. He walked toward it.    The forest face was forbidding and enormously high. It was so squarely  turned to the sea that it looked as though it had been planed by tools.  Maskull strode along in the shade of the trees, but kept his head  constantly turned away from them, toward the sea—there it was more  cheerful. The creek, when he reached it, proved to be broad and flat-  banked. It was not a river, but an arm of the sea. Its still, dark green  water curved around a bend out of sight, into the forest. The trees on  both banks overhung the water, so that it was completely in shadow.    He went as far as the bend, beyond which another short reach appeared. A  man was sitting on a narrow shelf of bank, with his feet in the water.  He was clothed in a coarse, rough hide, which left his limbs bare. He  was short, thick, and sturdy, with short legs and a long, powerful arms,  terminating in hands of an extraordinary size. He was oldish. His face  was plain, slablike, and expressionless; it was full of wrinkles, and  walnut-coloured. Both face and head were bald, and his skin was tough  and leathery. He seemed to be some sort of peasant, or fisherman; there  was no trace in his face of thought for others, or delicacy of feeling.  He possessed three eyes, of different colors—jade-green, blue, and  ulfire.    In front of him, riding on the water, moored to the bank, was an  elementary raft, consisting of the branches of trees, clumsily corded  together.    Maskull addressed him. “Are you another of the wise men of the Wombflash  Forest?”    The man answered him in a gruff, husky voice, looking up as he did so.  “I’m a fisherman. I know nothing about wisdom.”    “What name do you go by?”    “Polecrab. What’s yours?”    “Maskull. If you’re a fisherman, you ought to have fish. I’m famishing.”    Polecrab grunted, and paused a minute before answering.    “There’s fish enough. My dinner is cooking in the sands now. It’s easy  enough to get you some more.”    Maskull found this a pleasant speech.    “But how long will it take?” he asked.    The man slid the palms of his hands together, producing a shrill,  screeching noise. He lifted his feet from the water, and clambered onto  the bank. In a minute or two a curious little beast came crawling up to  his feet, turning its face and eyes up affectionately, like a dog. It  was about two feet long, and somewhat resembled a small seal, but had  six legs, ending in strong claws.    “Arg, go fish!” said Polecrab hoarsely.    The animal immediately tumbled off the bank into the water. It swam  gracefully to the middle of the creek and made a pivotal dive beneath  the surface, where it remained a great while.    “Simple fishing,” remarked Maskull. “But what’s the raft for?”    “To go to sea with. The best fish are out at sea. These are eatable.”    “That arg seems a highly intelligent creature.”    Polecrab grunted again. “I’ve trained close on a hundred of them. The  bigheads learn best, but they’re slow swimmers. The narrowheads swim  like eels, but can’t be taught. Now I’ve started interbreeding them—he’s  one of them.”    “Do you live here alone?”    “No, I’ve got a wife and three boys. My wife’s sleeping somewhere, but  where the lads are, Shaping knows.”    Maskull began to feel very much at home with this unsophisticated being.    “The raft’s all crazy,” he remarked, staring at it. “If you go far out  in that, you’ve got more pluck than I have.”    “I’ve been to Matterplay on it,” said Polecrab.    The arg reappeared and started swimming to shore, but this time  clumsily, as if it were bearing a heavy weight under the surface. When  it landed at its master’s feet, they saw that each set of claws was  clutching a fish—six in all. Polecrab took them from it. He proceeded to  cut off the heads and tails with a sharp-edged stone which he picked up;  these he threw to the arg, which devoured them without any fuss.    Polecrab beckoned to Maskull to follow him and, carrying the fish,  walked toward the open shore, by the same way that he had come. When  they reached the sands, he sliced the fish, removed the entrails, and  digging a shallow hole in a patch of violet sand, placed the remainder  of the carcasses in it, and covered them over again. Then he dug up his  own dinner. Maskull’s nostrils quivered at the savoury smell, but he was  not yet to dine.    Polecrab, turning to go with the cooked fish in his hands, said, “These  are mine, not yours. When yours are done, you can come back and join me,  supposing you want company.”    “How soon will that be?”    “About twenty minutes,” replied the fisherman, over his shoulder.    Maskull sheltered himself in the shadows of the forest, and waited. When  the time had approximately elapsed, he disinterred his meal, scorching  his fingers in the operation, although it was only the surface of the  sand which was so intensely hot. Then he returned to Polecrab.    In the warm, still air and cheerful shade of the inlet, they munched in  silence, looking from their food to the sluggish water, and back again.  With every mouthful Maskull felt his strength returning. He finished  before Polecrab, who ate like a man for whom time has no value. When he  had done, he stood up.    “Come and drink,” he said, in his husky voice.    Maskull looked at him inquiringly.    The man led him a little way into the forest, and walked straight up to  a certain tree. At a convenient height in its trunk a hole had been  tapped and plugged. Polecrab removed the plug and put his mouth to the  aperture, sucking for quite a long time, like a child at its mother’s  breast. Maskull, watching him, imagined that he saw his eyes growing  brighter.    When his own turn came to drink, he found the juice of the tree somewhat  like coconut milk in flavour, but intoxicating. It was a new sort of  intoxication, however, for neither his will not his emotions were  excited, but only his intellect—and that only in a certain way. His  thoughts and images were not freed and loosened, but on the contrary  kept labouring and swelling painfully, until they reached the full  beauty of an aperçu, which would then flame up in his consciousness,  burst, and vanish. After that, the whole process started over again. But  there was never a moment when he was not perfectly cool, and master of  his senses. When each had drunk twice, Polecrab replugged the hole, and  they returned to their bank.    “Is it Blodsombre yet?” asked Maskull, sprawling on the ground, well  content.    Polecrab resumed his old upright sitting posture, with his feet in the  water. “Just beginning,” was his hoarse response.    “Then I must stay here till it’s over.... Shall we talk?”    “We can,” said the other, without enthusiasm.    Maskull glanced at him through half-closed lids, wondering if he were  exactly what he seemed to be. In his eyes he thought he detected a wise  light.    “Have you travelled much, Polecrab?”    “Not what you would call travelling.”    “You tell me you’ve been to Matterplay—what kind of country is that?”    “I don’t know. I went there to pick up flints.”    “What countries lie beyond it?”    “Threal comes next, as you go north. They say it’s a land of mystics...  I don’t know.”    “Mystics?”    “So I’m told.... Still farther north there’s Lichstorm.”    “Now we’re going far afield.”    “There are mountains there—and altogether it must be a very dangerous  place, especially for a full-blooded man like you. Take care of  yourself.”    “This is rather premature, Polecrab. How do you know I’m going there?”    “As you’ve come from the south, I suppose you’ll go north.”    “Well, that’s right enough,” said Maskull, staring hard at him. “But how  do you know I’ve come from the south?”    “Well, then, perhaps you haven’t—but there’s a look of Ifdawn about  you.”    “What kind of look?”    “A tragical look,” said Polecrab. He never even glanced at Maskull, but  was gazing at a fixed spot on the water with unblinking eyes.    “What lies beyond Lichstorm?” asked Maskull, after a minute or two.    “Barey, where you have two suns instead of one—but beyond that fact I  know nothing about it.... Then comes the ocean.”    “And what’s on the other side of the ocean?”    “That you must find out for yourself, for I doubt if anybody has ever  crossed it and come back.”    Maskull was silent for a little while.    “How is it that your people are so unadventurous? I seem to be the only  one travelling from curiosity.”    “What do you mean by ‘your people’?”    “True—you don’t know that I don’t belong to your planet at all. I’ve  come from another world, Polecrab.”    “What to find?”    “I came here with Krag and Nightspore—to follow Surtur. I must have  fainted the moment I arrived. When I sat up, it was night and the others  had vanished. Since then I’ve been travelling at random.”    Polecrab scratched his nose. “You haven’t found Surtur yet?”    “I’ve heard his drum taps frequently. In the forest this morning I came  quite close to him. Then two days ago, in the Lusion Plain, I saw a  vision—a being in man’s shape, who called himself Surtur.”    “Well, maybe it was Surtur.”    “No, that’s impossible,” replied Maskull reflectively. “It was  Crystalman. And it isn’t a question of my suspecting it—I know it.”    “How?”    “Because this is Crystalman’s world, and Surtur’s world is something  quite different.”    “That’s queer, then,” said Polecrab.    “Since I’ve come out of that forest,” proceeded Maskull, talking half to  himself, “a change has come over me, and I see things differently.  Everything here looks much more solid and real in my eyes than in other  places so much so that I can’t entertain the least doubt of its  existence. It not only looks real, it is real—and on that I would stake  my life.... But at the same time that it’s real, it is false.”    “Like a dream?”    “No—not at all like a dream, and that’s just what I want to explain.  This world of yours—and perhaps of mine too, for that matter—doesn’t  give me the slightest impression of a dream, or an illusion, or anything  of that sort. I know it’s really here at this moment, and it’s exactly  as we’re seeing it, you and I. Yet it’s false. It’s false in this sense,  Polecrab. Side by side with it another world exists, and that other  world is the true one, and this one is all false and deceitful, to the  very core. And so it occurs to me that reality and falseness are two  words for the same thing.”    “Perhaps there is such another world,” said Polecrab huskily. “But did  that vision also seem real and false to you?”    “Very real, but not false then, for then I didn’t understand all this.  But just because it was real, it couldn’t have been Surtur, who has no  connection with reality.”    “Didn’t those drum taps sound real to you?”    “I had to hear them with my ears, and so they sounded real to me. Still,  they were somehow different, and they certainly came from Surtur. If I  didn’t hear them correctly, that was my fault and not his.”    Polecrab growled a little. “If Surtur chooses to speak to you in that  fashion, it appears he’s trying to say something.”    “What else can I think? But, Polecrab, what’s your opinion—is he calling  me to the life after death?”    The old man stirred uneasily. “I’m a fisherman,” he said, after a minute  or two. “I live by killing, and so does everybody. This life seems to me  all wrong. So maybe life of any kind is wrong, and Surtur’s world is not  life at all, but something else.”    “Yes, but will death lead me to it, whatever it is?”    “Ask the dead,” said Polecrab, “and not a living man.”    Maskull continued. “In the forest I heard music and saw a light, which  could not have belonged to this world. They were too strong for my  senses, and I must have fainted for a long time. There was a vision as  well, in which I saw myself killed, while Nightspore walked on toward  the light, alone.”    Polecrab uttered his grunt. “You have enough to think over.”    A short silence ensued, which was broken by Maskull.    “So strong is my sense of the untruth of this present life, that it may  come to my putting an end to myself.” The fisherman remained quiet and  immobile.    Maskull lay on his stomach, propped his face on his hands, and stared at  him. “What do you think, Polecrab? Is it possible for any man, while in  the body, to gain a closer view of that other world than I have done?”    “I am an ignorant man, stranger, so I can’t say. Perhaps there are many  others like you who would gladly know.”    “Where? I should like to meet them.”    “Do you think you were made of one stuff, and the rest of mankind of  another stuff?”    “I can’t be so presumptuous. Possibly all men are reaching out toward  Muspel, in most cases without being aware of it.”    “In the wrong direction,” said Polecrab.    Maskull gave him a strange look. “How so?”    “I don’t speak from my own wisdom,” said Polecrab, “for I have none; but  I have just now recalled what Broodviol once told me, when I was a young  man, and he was an old one. He said that Crystalman tries to turn all  things into one, and that whichever way his shapes march, in order to  escape from him, they find themselves again face to face with  Crystalman, and are changed into new crystals. But that this marching of  shapes (which we call ‘forking’) springs from the unconscious desire to  find Surtur, but is in the opposite direction to the right one. For  Surtur’s world does not lie on this side of the one, which was the  beginning of life, but on the other side; and to get to it we must  repass through the one. But this can only be by renouncing our self-  life, and reuniting ourselves to the whole of Crystalman’s world. And  when this has been done, it is only the first stage of the journey;  though many good men imagine it to be the whole journey.... As far as I  can remember, that is what Broodviol said, but perhaps, as I was then a  young and ignorant man, I may have left out words which would explain  his meaning better.”    Maskull, who had listened attentively to all this, remained thoughtful  at the end.    “It’s plain enough,” he said. “But what did he mean by our reuniting  ourselves to Crystalman’s world? If it is false, are we to make  ourselves false as well?”    “I didn’t ask him that question, and you are as well qualified to answer  it as I am.”    “He must have meant that, as it is, we are each of us living in a false,  private world of our own, a world of dreams and appetites and distorted  perceptions. By embracing the great world we certainly lose nothing in  truth and reality.”    Polecrab withdrew his feet from the water, stood up, yawned, and  stretched his limbs.    “I have told you all I know,” he said in a surly voice. “Now let me go  to sleep.”    Maskull kept his eyes fixed on him, but made no reply. The old man let  himself down stiffly on to the ground, and prepared to rest.    While he was still arranging his position to his liking, a footfall  sounded behind the two men, coming from the direction of the forest.  Maskull twisted his neck, and saw a woman approaching them. He at once  guessed that it was Polecrab’s wife. He sat up, but the fisherman did  not stir. The woman came and stood in front of them, looking down from  what appeared a great height.    Her dress was similar to her husband’s, but covered her limbs more. She  was young, tall, slender, and strikingly erect. Her skin was lightly  tanned, and she looked strong, but not at all peasantlike. Refinement  was stamped all over her. Her face had too much energy of expression for  a woman, and she was not beautiful. Her three great eyes kept flashing  and glowing. She had great masses of fine, yellow hair, coiled up and  fastened, but so carelessly that some of the strands were flowing down  her back.    When she spoke, it was in a rather weak voice, but full of lights and  shades, and somehow intense passionateness never seemed to be far away  from it.    “Forgiveness is asked for listening to your conversation,” she said,  addressing Maskull. “I was resting behind the tree, and heard it all.”    He got up slowly. “Are you Polecrab’s wife?”    “She is my wife,” said Polecrab, “and her name is Gleameil. Sit down  again, stranger—and you too, wife, since you are here.”    They both obeyed. “I heard everything,” repeated Gleameil. “But what I  did not hear was where you are going to, Maskull, after you have left  us.”    “I know no more than you do.”    “Listen, then. There’s only one place for you to go to, and that is  Swaylone’s Island. I will ferry you across myself before sunset.”    “What shall I find there?”    “He may go, wife,” put in the old man hoarsely, “but I won’t allow you  to go. I will take him over myself.”    “No, you have always put me off,” said Gleameil, with some emotion.  “This time I mean to go. When Teargeld shines at night, and I sit on the  shore here, listening to Earthrid’s music travelling faintly across the  sea, I am tortured—I can’t endure it.... I have long since made up my  mind to go to the island, and see what this music is. If it’s bad, if it  kills me—well.”    “What have I to do with the man and his music, Gleameil?” demanded  Maskull.    “I think the music will answer all your questions better than Polecrab  has done—and possibly in a way that will surprise you.”    “What kind of music can it be to travel all those miles across the sea?”    “A peculiar kind, so we are told. Not pleasant, but painful. And the man  that can play the instrument of Earthrid would be able to conjure up the  most astonishing forms, which are not phantasms, but realities.”    “That may be so,” growled Polecrab. “But I have been to the island by  daylight, and what did I find there? Human bones, new and ancient. Those  are Earthrid’s victims. And you, wife, shall not go.”    “But will that music play tonight?” asked Maskull.    “Yes,” replied Gleameil, gazing at him intently. “When Teargeld rises,  which is our moon.”    “If Earthrid plays men to death, it appears to me that his own death is  due. In any case I should like to hear those sounds for myself. But as  for taking you with me, Gleameil—women die too easily in Tormance. I  have only just now washed myself clean of the death blood of another  woman.”    Gleameil laughed, but said nothing.    “Now go to sleep,” said Polecrab. “When the time comes, I will take you  across myself.”    He lay down again, and closed his eyes. Maskull followed his example;  but Gleameil remained sitting erect, with her legs under her.    “Who was that other woman, Maskull?” she asked presently.    He did not answer, but pretended to sleep.        Chapter 15. SWAYLONE’S ISLAND    When he awoke, the day was not so bright, and he guessed it was late  afternoon. Polecrab and his wife were both on their feet, and another  meal of fish had been cooked and was waiting for him.    “Is it decided who is to go with me?” he asked, before sitting down.    “I go,” said Gleameil.    “Do you agree, Polecrab?”    The fisherman growled a little in his throat and motioned to the others  to take their seats. He took a mouthful before answering.    “Something strong is attracting her, and I can’t hold her back. I don’t  think I shall see you again, wife, but the lads are now nearly old  enough to fend for themselves.”    “Don’t take dejected views,” replied Gleameil sternly. She was not  eating. “I shall come back, and make amends to you. It’s only for a  night.”    Maskull gazed from one to the other in perplexity. “Let me go alone. I  would be sorry if anything happened.”    Gleameil shook her head.    “Don’t regard this as a woman’s caprice,” she said. “Even if you hadn’t  passed this way, I would have heard that music soon. I have a hunger for  it.”    “Haven’t you any such feeling, Polecrab?”    “No. A woman is a noble and sensitive creature, and there are  attractions in nature too subtle for males. Take her with you, since she  is set on it. Maybe she’s right. Perhaps Earthrid’s music will answer  your questions, and hers too.”    “What are your questions, Gleameil?”    The woman shed a strange smile. “You may be sure that a question which  requires music for an answer can’t be put into words.”    “If you are not back by the morning,” remarked her husband, “I will know  you are dead.”    The meal was finished in a constrained silence. Polecrab wiped his  mouth, and produced a seashell from a kind of pocket.    “Will you say goodbye to the boys? Shall I call them?” She considered a  moment.    “Yes—yes, I must see them.”    He put the shell to his mouth, and blew; a loud, mournful noise passed  through the air.    A few minutes later there was a sound of scurrying footsteps, and the  boys were seen emerging from the forest. Maskull looked with curiosity  at the first children he had seen on Tormance. The oldest boy was  carrying the youngest on his back, while the third trotted some distance  behind. The child was let down, and all the three formed a semicircle in  front of Maskull, standing staring up at him with wide-open eyes.  Polecrab looked on stolidly, but Gleameil glanced away from them, with  proudly raised head and a baffling expression.    Maskull put the ages of the boys at about nine, seven, and five years,  respectively; but he was calculating according to Earth time. The eldest  was tall, slim, but strongly built. He, like his brothers, was naked,  and his skin from top to toe was ulfire-colored. His facial muscles  indicated a wild and daring nature, and his eyes were like green fires.  The second showed promise of being a broad, powerful man. His head was  large and heavy, and drooped. His face and skin were reddish. His eyes  were almost too sombre and penetrating for a child’s.    “That one,” said Polecrab, pinching the boy’s ear, “may perhaps grow up  to be a second Broodviol.”    “Who was that?” demanded the boy, bending his head forward to hear the  answer.    “A big, old man, of marvellous wisdom. He became wise by making up his  mind never to ask questions, but to find things out for himself.”    “If I had not asked this question, I should not have known about him.”    “That would not have mattered,” replied the father.    The youngest child was paler and slighter than his brothers. His face  was mostly tranquil and expressionless, but it had this peculiarity  about it, that every few minutes, without any apparent cause, it would  wrinkle up and look perplexed. At these times his eyes, which were of a  tawny gold, seemed to contain secrets difficult to associate with one of  his age.    “He puzzles me,” said Polecrab. “He has a soul like sap, and he’s  interested in nothing. He may turn out to be the most remarkable of the  bunch.”    Maskull took the child in one hand, and lifted him as high as his head.  He took a good look at him, and set him down again. The boy never  changed countenance.    “What do you make of him?” asked the fisherman.    “It’s on the tip of my tongue to say, but it just escapes me. Let me  drink again, and then I shall have it.”    “Go and drink, then.”    Maskull strode over to the tree, drank, and returned. “In ages to come,”  he said, speaking deliberately, “he will be a grand and awful tradition.  A seer possibly, or even a divinity. Watch over him well.”    The eldest boy looked scornful. “I want to be none of those things. I  would like to be like that big fellow.” And he pointed his finger at  Maskull.    He laughed, and showed his white teeth through his beard. “Thanks for  the compliments old warrior!” he said.    “He’s great and brawny,” continued the boy, “and can hold his own with  other men. Can you hold me up with one arm, as you did that child?”    Maskull complied.    “That is being a man!” exclaimed the boy. “Enough!” said Polecrab  impatiently. “I called you lads here to say goodbye to your mother. She  is going away with this man. I think she may not return, but we don’t  know.”    The second boy’s face became suddenly inflamed. “Is she going of her own  choice?” he inquired.    “Yes,” replied the father.    “Then she is bad.” He brought the words out with such force and emphasis  that they sounded like the crack of a whip.    The old man cuffed him twice. “Is it your mother you are speaking of?”    The boy stood his ground, without change of expression, but said  nothing.    The youngest child spoke, for the first time. “My mother will not come  back, but she will die dancing.”    Polecrab and his wife looked at one another.    “Where are you going to, Mother?” asked the eldest lad.    Gleameil bent down, and kissed him. “To the Island.”    “Well then, if you don’t come back by tomorrow morning, I will go and  look for you.”    Maskull grew more and more uneasy in his mind. “This seems to me to be a  man’s journey,” he said. “I think it would be better for you not to  come, Gleameil.”    “I am not to be dissuaded,” she replied.    He stroked his beard in perplexity. “Is it time to start?”    “It wants four hours to sunset, and we shall need all that.”    Maskull sighed. “I’ll go to the mouth of the creek, and wait there for  you and the raft. You will wish to make your farewells, Gleameil.”    He then clasped Polecrab by the hand. “Adieu, fisherman!”    “You have repaid me well for my answers,” said the old man gruffly. “But  it’s not your fault, and in Shaping’s world the worst things happen.”    The eldest boy came close to Maskull, and frowned at him. “Farewell, big  man!” he said. “But guard my mother well, as well as you are well able  to, or I shall follow you, and kill you.”    Maskull walked slowly along the creek bank till he came to the bend. The  glorious sunshine, and the sparkling, brilliant sea then met his eyes  again; and all melancholy was swept out of his mind. He continued as far  as the seashore, and issuing out of the shadows of the forest, strolled  on to the sands, and sat down in the full sunlight. The radiance of  Alppain had long since disappeared. He drank in the hot, invigorating  wind, listened to the hissing waves, and stared over the coloured sea  with its pinnacles and currents, at Swaylone’s Island.    “What music can that be, which tears a wife and mother away from all she  loves the most?” he meditated. “It sounds unholy. Will it tell me what I  want to know? Can it?”    In a little while he became aware of a movement behind him, and, turning  his head, he saw the raft floating along the creek, toward the open sea.  Polecrab was standing upright, propelling it with a rude pole. He passed  by Maskull, without looking at him, or making any salutation, and  proceeded out to sea.    While he was wondering at this strange behaviour, Gleameil and the boys  came in sight, walking along the bank of the inlet. The eldest-born was  holding her hand, and talking; and the other two were behind. She was  calm and smiling, but seemed abstracted.    “What is your husband doing with the raft?” asked Maskull.    “He’s putting it in position and we shall wade out and join it,” she  answered, in her low-toned voice.    “But how shall we make the island, without oars or sails?”    “Don’t you see that current running away from land? See, he is  approaching it. That will take us straight there.”    “But how can you get back?”    “There is a way; but we need not think of that today.”    “Why shouldn’t I come too?” demanded the eldest boy.    “Because the raft won’t carry three. Maskull is a heavy man.”    “It doesn’t matter,” said the boy. “I know where there is wood for  another raft. As soon as you have gone, I shall set to work.”    Polecrab had by this time manoeuvred his flimsy craft to the position he  desired, within a few yards of the current, which at that point made a  sharp bend from the east. He shouted out some words to his wife and  Maskull. Gleameil kissed her children convulsively, and broke down a  little. The eldest boy bit his lip till it bled, and tears glistened in  his eyes; but the younger children stared wide-eyed, and displayed no  emotion.    Gleameil now walked into the sea, followed by Maskull. The water covered  first their ankles, then their knees, but when it came as high as their  waists, they were close on the raft. Polecrab let himself down into the  water, and assisted his wife to climb over the side. When she was up,  she bent down and kissed him. No words were exchanged. Maskull scrambled  up on to the front part of the raft. The woman sat cross-legged in the  stern, and seized the pole.    Polecrab shoved them off toward the current, while she worked her pole  until they had got within its power. The raft immediately began to  travel swiftly away from land, with a smooth, swaying motion.    The boys waved from the shore. Gleameil responded; but Maskull turned  his back squarely to land, and gazed ahead. Polecrab was wading back to  the shore.    For upward of an hour Maskull did not change his position by an inch. No  sound was heard but the splashing of the strange waves all around them,  and the streamlike gurgle of the current, which threaded its way  smoothly through the tossing, tumultuous sea. From their pathway of  safety, the beautiful dangers surrounding them were an exhilarating  experience. The air was fresh and clean, and the heat from Branchspell,  now low in the west, was at last endurable. The riot of sea colors had  long since banished all sadness and anxiety from his heart. Yet he felt  such a grudge against the woman for selfishly forsaking those who should  have been dear to her that he could not bring himself to begin a  conversation.    But when, over the now enlarged shape of the dark island, he caught  sight of a long chain of lofty, distant mountains, glowing salmon-pink  in the evening sunlight, he felt constrained to break the silence by  inquiring what they were.    “It is Lichstorm,” said Gleameil.    Maskull asked no questions about it; but in turning to address her, his  eyes had rested on the rapidly receding Wombflash Forest, and he  continued to stare at that. They had travelled about eight miles, and  now he could better estimate the enormous height of the trees.  Overtopping them, far away, he saw Sant; and he fancied, but was not  quite sure, that he could distinguish Disscourn as well.    “Now that we are alone in a strange place,” said Gleameil, averting her  head, and looking down over the side of the raft into the water, “tell  me what you thought of Polecrab.”    Maskull paused before answering. “He seemed to me like a mountain  wrapped in cloud. You see the lower buttresses, and think that is all.  But then, high up, far above the clouds, you suddenly catch sight of  more mountain—and even then it is not the top.”    “You read character well, and have great perception,” remarked Gleameil  quietly. “Now say what I am.”    “In place of a human heart, you have a wild harp, and that’s all I know  about you.”    “What was that you said to my husband about two worlds?”    “You heard.”    “Yes, I heard. And I also am conscious of two worlds. My husband and  boys are real to me, and I love them fondly. But there is another world  for me, as there is for you, Maskull, and it makes my real world appear  all false and vulgar.”    “Perhaps we are seeking the same thing. But can it be right to satisfy  our self-nature at the expense of other people?”    “No, it’s not right. It is wrong, and base. But in that other world  these words have no meaning.”    There was a silence.    “It’s useless to discuss such topics,” said Maskull. “The choice is now  out of our hands, and we must go where we are taken. What I would rather  speak about is what awaits us on the island.”    “I am ignorant—except that we shall find Earthrid there.”    “Who is Earthrid, and why is it called Swaylone’s Island?”    “They say Earthrid came from Threal, but I know nothing else about him.  As for Swaylone, if you like I will tell you his legend.”    “If you please,” said Maskull.    “In a far-back age,” began Gleameil, “when the seas were hot, and clouds  hung heavily over the earth, and life was rich with transformations,  Swaylone came to this island, on which men had never before set foot,  and began to play his music—the first music in Tormance. Nightly, when  the moon shone, people used to gather on this shore behind us, and  listen to the faint, sweet strains floating from over the sea. One  night, Shaping (whom you call Crystalman) was passing this way in  company with Krag. They listened a while to the music, and Shaping said  ‘Have you heard more beautiful sounds? This is my world and my music.’  Krag stamped with his foot, and laughed. ‘You must do better than that,  if I am to admire it. Let us pass over, and see this bungler at work.’  Shaping consented, and they passed over to the island. Swaylone was not  able to see their presence. Shaping stood behind him, and breathed  thoughts into his soul, so that his music became ten times lovelier, and  people listening on that shore went mad with sick delight. ‘Can any  strains be nobler?’ demanded Shaping. Krag grinned and said, ‘You are  naturally effeminate. Now let me try.’ Then he stood behind Swaylone,  and shot ugly discords fast into his head. His instrument was so  cracked, that never since has it played right. From that time forth  Swaylone could utter only distorted music; yet it called to folk more  than the other sort. Many men crossed over to the island during his  lifetime, to listen to the amazing tones, but none could endure them;  all died. After Swaylone’s death, another musician took up the tale; and  so the light has passed down from torch to torch, till now Earthrid  bears it.”    “An interesting legend,” commented Maskull. “But who is Krag?”    “They say that when the world was born, Krag was born with it—a spirit  compounded of those vestiges of Muspel which Shaping did not know how to  transform. Thereafter nothing has gone right with the world, for he dogs  Shaping’s footsteps everywhere, and whatever the latter does, he undoes.  To love he joins death; to sex, shame; to intellect, madness; to virtue,  cruelty; and to fair exteriors, bloody entrails. These are Krag’s  actions, so the lovers of the world call him ‘devil.’ They don’t  understand, Maskull, that without him the world would lose its beauty.”    “Krag and beauty!” exclaimed he, with a cynical smile.    “Even so. That same beauty which you and I are now voyaging to discover.  That beauty for whose sake I am renouncing husband, children, and  happiness.... Did you imagine beauty to be pleasant?”    “Surely.”    “That pleasant beauty is an insipid compound of Shaping. To see beauty  in its terrible purity, you must tear away the pleasure from it.”    “Do you say I am going to seek beauty, Gleameil? Such an idea is far  from my mind.”    She did not respond to his remark. After waiting for a few minutes, to  hear if she would speak again, he turned his back on her once more.  There was no more talk until they reached the island.    The air had grown chill and damp by the time they approached its shores.  Branchspell was on the point of touching the sea. The Island appeared to  be some three or four miles in length. There were first of all broad  sands, then low, dark cliffs, and behind these a wilderness of  insignificant, swelling hills, entirely devoid of vegetation. The  current bore them to within a hundred yards of the coast, when it made a  sharp angle, and proceeded to skirt the length of the land.    Gleameil jumped overboard, and began swimming to shore. Maskull followed  her example, and the raft, abandoned, was rapidly borne away by the  current. They soon touched ground, and were able to wade the rest of the  way. By the time they reached dry land, the sun had set.    Gleameil made straight for the hills; and Maskull, after casting a  single glance at the low, dim outline of the Wombflash Forest, followed  her. The cliffs were soon scrambled up. Then the ascent was gentle and  easy, while the rich, dry, brown mould was good to walk upon.    A little way off, on their left, something white was shining.    “You need not go to it,” said the woman. “It can be nothing else than  one of those skeletons Polecrab talked about. And look—there is another  one over there!”    “This brings it home!” remarked Maskull, smiling.    “There is nothing comical in having died for beauty,” said Gleameil,  bending her brows at him.    And when in the course of their walk he saw the innumerable human bones,  from gleaming white to dirty yellow, lying scattered about, as if it  were a naked graveyard among the hills, he agreed with her, and fell  into a sombre mood.    It was still light when they reached the highest point, and could set  eyes on the other side. The sea to the north of the island was in no way  different from that which they had crossed, but its lively colors were  fast becoming invisible.    “That is Matterplay,” said the woman, pointing her finger toward some  low land on the horizon, which seemed to be even farther off than  Wombflash.    “I wonder how Digrung passed over,” meditated Maskull.    Not far away, in a hollow enclosed by a circle of little hills, they saw  a small, circular lake, not more than half a mile in diameter. The  sunset colors of the sky were reflected in its waters.    “That must be Irontick,” remarked Gleameil.    “What is that?”    “I have heard that it’s the instrument Earthrid plays on.”    “We are getting close,” responded he. “Let us go and investigate.”    When they drew nearer, they observed that a man was reclining on the  farther side, in an attitude of sleep.    “If that’s not the man himself, who can it be?” said Maskull. “Let’s get  across the water, if it will bear us; it will save time.”    He now assumed the lead, and took running strides down the slope which  bounded the lake on that side. Gleameil followed him with greater  dignity, keeping her eyes fixed on the recumbent man as if fascinated.  When Maskull reached the water’s edge, he tried it with one foot, to  discover if it would carry his weight. Something unusual in its  appearance led him to have doubts. It was a tranquil, dark, and  beautifully reflecting sheet of water; it resembled a mirror of liquid  metal. Finding that it would bear him, and that nothing happened, he  placed his second foot on its surface. Instantly he sustained a violent  shock throughout his body, as from a powerful electric current; and he  was hurled in a tumbled heap back on to the bank.    He picked himself up, brushed the dirt off his person, and started  walking around the lake. Gleameil joined him, and they completed the  half circuit together. They came to the man, and Maskull prodded him  with his foot. He woke up, and blinked at them.    His face was pale, weak, and vacant-looking, and had a disagreeable  expression. There were thin sprouts of black hair on his chin and head.  On his forehead, in place of a third eye, he possessed a perfectly  circular organ, with elaborate convolutions, like an ear. He had an  unpleasant smell. He appeared to be of young middle age.    “Wake up, man,” said Maskull sharply, “and tell us if you are Earthrid.”    “What time is it?” counterquestioned the man. “Does it want long to  moonrise?”    Without appearing to care about an answer, he sat up, and turning away  from them, began to scoop up the loose soil with his hand, and to eat it  halfheartedly.    “Now, how can you eat that filth?” demanded Maskull, in disgust.    “Don’t be angry, Maskull,” said Gleameil, laying hold of his arm, and  flushing a little. “It is Earthrid—the man who is to help us.”    “He has not said so.”    “I am Earthrid,” said the other, in his weak and muffled voice, which,  however, suddenly struck Maskull as being autocratic. “What do you want  here? Or rather, you had better get away as quickly as you can, for it  will be too late when Teargeld rises.”    “You need not explain,” exclaimed Maskull. “We know your reputation, and  we have come to hear your music. But what’s that organ for on your  forehead?”    Earthrid glared, and smiled, and glared again.    “That is for rhythm, which is what changes noise into music. Don’t stand  and argue, but go away. It is no pleasure to me to people the island  with corpses. They corrupt the air, and do nothing else.”    Darkness now crept swiftly on over the landscape.    “You are rather bigmouthed,” said Maskull coolly. “But after we have  heard you play, perhaps I shall adventure a tune myself.”    “You? Are you a musician, then? Do you even know what music is?”    A flame danced in Gleameil’s eyes.    “Maskull thinks music reposes in the instrument,” she said in her  intense way. “But it is in the soul of the Master.”    “Yes,” said Earthrid, “but that is not all. I will tell you what it is.  In Threal, where I was born and brought up, we learn the mystery of the  Three in nature. This world, which lies extended before us, has three  directions. Length is the line which shuts off what is, from what is  not. Breadth is the surface which shows us in what manner one thing of  what-is, lives with another thing. Depth is the path which leads from  what-is, to our own body. In music it is not otherwise. Tone is  existence, without which nothing at all can be. Symmetry and Numbers are  the manner in which tones exist, one with another. Emotion is the  movement of our soul toward the wonderful world that is being created.  Now, men when they make music are accustomed to build beautiful tones,  because of the delight they cause. Therefore their music world is based  on pleasure; its symmetry is regular and charming, its emotion is sweet  and lovely.... But my music is founded on painful tones; and thus its  symmetry is wild, and difficult to discover; its emotion is bitter and  terrible.”    “If I had not anticipated its being original, I would not have come  here,” said Maskull. “Still, explain—why can’t harsh tones have simple  symmetry of form? And why must they necessarily cause more profound  emotions in us who listen?”    “Pleasures may harmonise. Pains must clash; and in the order of their  clashing lies the symmetry. The emotions follow the music, which is  rough and earnest.”    “You may call it music,” remarked Maskull thoughtfully, “but to me it  bears a closer resemblance to actual life.”    “If Shaping’s plans had gone straight, life would have been like that  other sort of music. He who seeks can find traces of that intention in  the world of nature. But as it has turned out, real life resembles my  music and mine is the true music.”    “Shall we see living shapes?”    “I don’t know what my mood will be,” returned Earthrid. “But when I have  finished, you shall adventure your tune, and produce whatever shapes you  please—unless, indeed, the tune is out of your own big body.”    “The shocks you are preparing may kill us,” said Gleameil, in a low,  taut voice, “but we shall die, seeing beauty.”    Earthrid looked at her with a dignified expression.    “Neither you, nor any other person, can endure the thoughts which I put  into my music. Still, you must have it your own way. It needed a woman  to call it ‘beauty.’ But if this is beauty, what is ugliness?”    “That I can tell you, Master,” replied Gleameil, smiling at him.  “Ugliness is old, stale life, while yours every night issues fresh from  the womb of nature.”    Earthrid stared at her, without response. “Teargeld is rising,” he said  at last. “And now you shall see—though not for long.”    As the words left his mouth, the full moon peeped over the hills in the  dark eastern sky. They watched it in silence, and soon it was wholly up.  It was larger than the moon of Earth, and seemed nearer. Its shadowy  parts stood out in just as strong relief, but somehow it did not give  Maskull the impression of being a dead world. Branchspell shone on the  whole of it, but Alppain only on a part. The broad crescent that  reflected Branchspell’s rays alone was white and brilliant; but the part  that was illuminated by both suns shone with a greenish radiance that  had almost solar power, and yet was cold and cheerless. On gazing at  that combined light, he felt the same sense of disintegration that the  afterglow of Alppain had always caused in him; but now the feeling was  not physical, but merely aesthetic. The moon did not appear romantic to  him, but disturbing and mystical.    Earthrid rose, and stood quietly for a minute. In the bright moonlight,  his face seemed to have undergone a change. It lost its loose, weak,  disagreeable look, and acquired a sort of crafty grandeur. He clapped  his hands together meditatively two or three times, and walked up and  down. The others stood together, watching him.    Then he sat down by the side of the lake, and, leaning on his side,  placed his right hand, open palm downward, on the ground, at the same  time stretching out his right leg, so that the foot was in contact with  the water.    While Maskull was in the act of staring at him and at the lake, he felt  a stabbing sensation right through his heart, as though he had been  pierced by a rapier. He barely recovered himself from falling, and as he  did so he saw that a spout had formed on the water, and was now  subsiding again. The next moment he was knocked down by a violent blow  in the mouth, delivered by an invisible hand. He picked himself up; and  observed that a second spout had formed. No sooner was he on his legs,  than a hideous pain hammered away inside his brain, as if caused by a  malignant tumour. In his agony, he stumbled and fell again; this time on  the arm Krag had wounded. All his other mishaps were forgotten in this  one, which half stunned him. It lasted only a moment, and then sudden  relief came, and he found that Earthrid’s rough music had lost its power  over him.    He saw him still stretched in the same position. Spouts were coming  thick and fast on the lake, which was full of lively motion. But  Gleameil was not on her legs. She was lying on the ground, in a heap,  without moving. Her attitude was ugly, and he guessed she was dead. When  he reached her, he discovered that she was dead. In what state of mind  she had died, he did not know, for her face wore the vulgar Crystalman  grin. The whole tragedy had not lasted five minutes.    He went over to Earthrid and dragged him forcibly away from his playing.    “You have been as good as your word, musician,” he said. “Gleameil is  dead.”    Earthrid tried to collect his scattered senses.    “I warned her,” he replied, sitting up. “Did I not beg her to go away?  But she died very easily. She did not wait for the beauty she spoke  about. She heard nothing of the passion, nor even of the rhythm. Neither  have you.”    Maskull looked down at him in indignation, but said nothing.    “You should not have interrupted me,” went on Earthrid. “When I am  playing, nothing else is of importance. I might have lost the thread of  my ideas. Fortunately, I never forget. I shall start over again.”    “If music is to continue, in the presence of the dead, I play next.”    The man glanced up quickly.    “That can’t be.”    “It must be,” said Maskull decisively. “I prefer playing to listening.  Another reason is that you will have every night, but I have only  tonight.”    Earthrid clenched and unclenched his fist, and began to turn pale. “With  your recklessness, you are likely to kill us both. Irontick belongs to  me, and until you have learned how to play, you would only break the  instrument.”    “Well, then, I will break it; but I am going to try.”    The musician jumped to his feet and confronted him. “Do you intend to  take it from me by violence?”    “Keep calm! You will have the same choice that you offered us. I shall  give you time to go away somewhere.”    “How will that serve me, if you spoil my lake? You don’t understand what  you are doing.”    “Go, or stay!” responded Maskull. “I give you till the water gets smooth  again. After that, I begin playing.”    Earthrid kept swallowing. He glanced at the lake and back to Maskull.    “Do you swear it?”    “How long that will take, you know better than I; but till then you are  safe.”    Earthrid cast him a look of malice, hesitated for an instant, and then  moved away, and started to climb the nearest hill. Halfway up he glanced  over his shoulder apprehensively, as if to see what was happening. In  another minute or so, he had disappeared over the crest, travelling in  the direction of the shore that faced Matterplay.    Later, when the water was once more tranquil, Maskull sat down by its  edge, in imitation of Earthrid’s attitude. He knew neither how to set  about producing his music, nor what would come of it. But audacious  projects entered his brain and he willed to create physical shapes—and,  above all, one shape, that of Surtur.    Before putting his foot to the water, he turned things over a little in  his mind.    He said, “What themes are in common music, shapes are in this music. The  composer does not find his theme by picking out single notes; but the  whole theme flashes into his mind by inspiration. So it must be with  shapes. When I start playing, if I am worth anything, the undivided  ideas will pass from my unconscious mind to this lake, and then,  reflected back in the dimensions of reality, I shall be for the first  time made acquainted with them. So it must be.”    The instant his foot touched the water, he felt his thoughts flowing  from him. He did not know what they were, but the mere act of flowing  created a sensation of joyful mastery. With this was curiosity to learn  what they would prove to be. Spouts formed on the lake in increasing  numbers, but he experienced no pain. His thoughts, which he knew to be  music, did not issue from him in a steady, unbroken stream, but in  great, rough gushes, succeeding intervals of quiescence. When these  gushes came, the whole lake broke out in an eruption of spouts.    He realised that the ideas passing from him did not arise in his  intellect, but had their source in the fathomless depths of his will. He  could not decide what character they should have, but he was able to  force them out, or retard them, by the exercise of his volition.    At first nothing changed around him. Then the moon grew dimmer, and a  strange, new radiance began to illuminate the landscape. It increased so  imperceptibly that it was some time before he recognised it as the  Muspel-light which he had seen in the Wombflash Forest. He could not  give it a colour, or a name, but it filled him with a sort of stern and  sacred awe. He called up the resources of his powerful will. The spouts  thickened like a forest, and many of them were twenty feet high.  Teargeld looked faint and pale; the radiance became intense; but it cast  no shadows. The wind got up, but where Maskull was sitting, it was calm.  Shortly afterward it began to shriek and whistle, like a full gale. He  saw no shapes, and redoubled his efforts.    His ideas were now rushing out onto the lake so furiously that his whole  soul was possessed by exhilaration and defiance. But still he did not  know their nature. A huge spout shot up and at the same moment the hills  began to crack and break. Great masses of loose soil were erupted from  their bowels, and in the next period of quietness, he saw that the  landscape had altered. Still the mysterious light intensified. The moon  disappeared entirely. The noise of the unseen tempest was terrifying,  but Maskull played heroically on, trying to urge out ideas which would  take shape. The hillsides were cleft with chasms. The water escaping  from the tops of the spouts, swamped the land; but where he was, it was  dry.    The radiance grew terrible. It was everywhere, but Maskull fancied that  it was far brighter in one particular quarter. He thought that it was  becoming localised, preparatory to contracting into a solid form. He  strained and strained....    Immediately afterward the bottom of the lake subsided. Its waters fell  through, and his instrument was broken.    The Muspel-light vanished. The moon shone out again, but Maskull could  not see it. After that unearthly shining, he seemed to himself to be in  total blackness. The screaming wind ceased; there was a dead silence.  His thoughts finished flowing toward the lake, and his foot no longer  touched water, but hung in space.    He was too stunned by the suddenness of the change to either think or  feel. While he was still lying dazed, a vast explosion occurred in the  newly opened depths beneath the lakebed. The water in its descent had  met fire. Maskull was lifted bodily in the air, many yards high, and  came down heavily. He lost consciousness....    When he came to his senses again, he saw everything. Teargeld was  gleaming brilliantly. He was lying by the side of the old lake, but it  was now a crater, to the bottom of which his eyes could not penetrate.  The hills encircling it were torn, as if by heavy gunfire. A few  thunderclouds were floating in the air at no great height, from which  branched lightning descended to the earth incessantly, accompanied by  alarming and singular crashes.    He got on his legs, and tested his actions. Finding that he was  uninjured, he first of all viewed the crater at closer quarters, and  then started to walk painfully toward the northern shore.    When he had attained the crest above the lake, the landscape sloped  gently down for two miles to the sea. Everywhere he passed through  traces of his rough work. The country was carved into scarps, grooves,  channels, and craters. He arrived at the line of low cliffs overlooking  the beach, and found that these also were partly broken down by  landslips. He got down onto the sand and stood looking over the moonlit,  agitated sea, wondering how he could contrive to escape from this island  of failure.    Then he saw Earthrid’s body, lying quite close to him. It was on its  back. Both legs had been violently torn off and he could not see them  anywhere. Earthrid’s teeth were buried in the flesh of his right  forearm, indicating that the man had died in unreasoning physical agony.  The skin gleamed green in the moonlight, but it was stained by darker  discolourations, which were wounds. The sand about him was dyed by the  pool of blood which had long since filtered through.    Maskull left the corpse in dismay, and walked a long way along the  sweet-smelling shore. Sitting down on a rock, he waited for daybreak.        Chapter 16. LEEHALLFAE    At midnight, when Teargeld was in the south, throwing his shadow  straight toward the sea and making everything nearly as bright as day,  he saw a great tree floating in the water, not far out. It was thirty  feet out of the water, upright, and alive, and its roots must have been  enormously deep and wide. It was drifting along the coast, through the  heavy seas. Maskull eyed it incuriously for a few minutes. Then it  dawned on him that it might be a good thing to investigate its nature.  Without stopping to weigh the danger, he immediately swam out, caught  hold of the lowest branch, and swung himself up.    He looked aloft and saw that the main stem was thick to the very top,  terminating in a knob that somewhat resembled a human head. He made his  way toward this knob, through the multitude of boughs, which were  covered with tough, slippery, marine leaves, like seaweed. Arriving at  the crown, he found that it actually was a sort of head, for there were  membranes like rudimentary eyes all the way around it, denoting some  form of low intelligence.    At that moment the tree touched bottom, though some way from the shore,  and began to bump heavily. To steady himself, Maskull put his hand out,  and, in doing so, accidentally covered some of the membranes. The tree  sheered off the land, as if by an act of will. When it was steady again,  Maskull removed his hand; they at once drifted back to shore. He thought  a bit, and then started experimenting with the eyelike membranes. It was  as he had guessed—these eyes were stimulated by the light of the moon,  and whichever way the light came from, the tree would travel.    A rather defiant smile crossed Maskull’s face as it struck him that it  might be possible to navigate this huge plant-animal as far as  Matterplay. He lost no time in putting the conception into execution.  Tearing off some of the long, tough leaves, he bound up all the  membranes except the ones that faced the north. The tree instantly left  the island, and definitely put out to sea. It travelled due north. It  was not moving at more than a mile an hour, however, while Matterplay  was possibly forty miles distant.    The great spout waves fell against the trunk with mighty thuds; the  breaking seas hissed through the lower branches—Maskull rested high and  dry, but was more than a little apprehensive about their slow rate of  progress. Presently he sighted a current racing along toward the north-  west, and that put another idea into his head. He began to juggle with  the membranes again, and before long had succeeded in piloting his tree  into the fast-running stream. As soon as they were fairly in its rapids,  he blinded the crown entirely, and thenceforward the current acted in  the double capacity of road and steed.    Maskull made himself secure among the branches and slept for the  remainder of the night.    When his eyes opened again, the island was out of sight. Teargeld was  setting in the western sea. The sky in the east was bright with the  colours of the approaching day. The air was cool and fresh; the light  over the sea was beautiful, gleaming, and mysterious. Land—probably  Matterplay—lay ahead, a long, dark line of low cliffs, perhaps a mile  away. The current no longer ran toward the shore, but began to skirt the  coast without drawing any closer to it. As soon as Maskull realised the  fact, he manoeuvred the tree out of its channel and started drifting it  inshore. The eastern sky blazed up suddenly with violent dyes, and the  outer rim of Branchspell lifted itself above the sea. The moon had  already sunk.    The shore loomed nearer and nearer. In physical character it was like  Swaylone’s Island—the same wide sands, small cliffs, and rounded,  insignificant hills inland, without vegetation. In the early-morning  sunlight, however, it looked romantic. Maskull, hollow-eyed and morose,  cared nothing for all that, but the moment the tree grounded, clambered  swiftly down through the branches and dropped into the sea. By the time  he had swam ashore, the white, stupendous sun was high above the  horizon.    He walked along the sands toward the east for a considerable distance,  without having any special intention in his mind. He thought he would go  on until he came to some creek or valley, and then turn up it. The sun’s  rays were cheering, and began to relieve him of his oppressive night  weight. After strolling along the beach for about a mile, he was stopped  by a broad stream that flowed into the sea out of a kind of natural  gateway in the line of cliffs. Its water was of a beautiful, limpid  green, all filled with bubbles. So ice-cold, aerated, and enticing did  it look that he flung himself face downward on the ground and took a  prolonged draught. When he got up again his eyes started to play  pranks—they became alternately blurred and clear.... It may have been  pure imagination, but he fancied that Digrung was moving inside him.    He followed the bank of the stream through the gap in the cliffs, and  then for the first time saw the real Matterplay. A valley appeared, like  a jewel enveloped by naked rock. All the hill country was bare and  lifeless, but this valley lying in the heart of it was extremely  fertile; he had never seen such fertility. It wound up among the hills,  and all that he was looking at was its broad lower end. The floor of the  valley was about half a mile wide; the stream that ran down its middle  was nearly a hundred feet across, but was exceedingly shallow—in most  places not more than a few inches deep. The sides of the valley were  about seventy feet high, but very sloping; they were clothed from top to  bottom with little, bright-leaved trees—not of varied tints of one  colour, like Earth trees, but of widely diverse colours, most of which  were brilliant and positive.    The floor itself was like a magician’s garden. Densely interwoven trees,  shrubs, and parasitical climbers fought everywhere for possession of it.  The forms were strange and grotesque, and each one seemed different; the  colours of leaf, flower, sexual organs, and stem were equally  peculiar—all the different combinations of the five primary colours of  Tormance seemed to be represented, and the result, for Maskull was a  sort of eye chaos. So rank was the vegetation that he could not fight  his way through it; he was obliged to take to the riverbed. The contact  of the water created an odd tingling sensation throughout his body, like  a mild electric shock. There were no birds, but a few extraordinary-  looking winged reptiles of small size kept crossing the valley from hill  to hill. Swarms of flying insects clustered around him, threatening  mischief, but in the end it turned out that his blood was disagreeable  to them, for he was not bitten once. Repulsive crawling creatures  resembling centipedes, scorpions, snakes, and so forth were in myriads  on the banks of the stream, but they also made no attempt to use their  weapons on his bare legs and feet, as he passed through them into the  water.... Presently however, he was confronted in midstream by a hideous  monster, of the size of a pony, but resembling in shape—if it resembled  anything—a sea crustacean; and then he came to a halt. They stared at  one another, the beast with wicked eyes, Maskull with cool and wary  ones. While he was staring, a singular thing happened to him.    His eyes blurred again. But when in a minute or two this blurring passed  away and he saw clearly once more, his vision had changed in character.  He was looking right through the animal’s body and could distinguish all  its interior parts. The outer crust, however, and all the hard tissues  were misty and semi-transparent; through them a luminous network of  blood-red veins and arteries stood out in startling distinctness. The  hard parts faded away to nothingness, and the blood system alone was  left. Not even the fleshy ducts remained. The naked blood alone was  visible, flowing this way and that like a fiery, liquid skeleton, in the  shape of the monster. Then this blood began to change too. Instead of a  continuous liquid stream, Maskull perceived that it was composed of a  million individual points. The red colour had been an illusion caused by  the rapid motion of the points; he now saw clearly that they resembled  minute suns in their scintillating brightness. They seemed like a double  drift of stars, streaming through space. One drift was travelling toward  a fixed point in the centre, while the other was moving away from it. He  recognised the former as the veins of the beast, the latter as the  arteries, and the fixed point as the heart.    While he was still looking, lost in amazement, the starry network went  out suddenly like an extinguished flame. Where the crustacean had stood,  there was nothing. Yet through this “nothing” he could not see the  landscape. Something was standing there that intercepted the light,  though it possessed neither shape, colour, nor substance. And now the  object, which could no longer be perceived by vision, began to be felt  by emotion. A delightful, springlike sense of rising sap, of quickening  pulses of love, adventure, mystery, beauty, femininity—took possession  of his being, and, strangely enough, he identified it with the monster.  Why that invisible brute should cause him to feel young, sexual, and  audacious, he did not ask himself, for he was fully occupied with the  effect. But it was as if flesh, bones, and blood had been discarded, and  he were face to face with naked Life itself, which slowly passed into  his own body.    The sensations died away. There was a brief interval, and then the  streaming, starlike skeleton rose up again out of space. It changed to  the red-blood system. The hard parts of the body reappeared, with more  and more distinctness, and at the same time the network of blood grew  fainter. Presently the interior parts were entirely concealed by the  crust—the creature stood opposite Maskull in its old formidable  ugliness, hard, painted, and concrete.    Disliking something about him, the crustacean turned aside and stumbled  awkwardly away on its six legs, with laborious and repulsive movements,  toward the other bank of the stream.    Maskull’s apathy left him after this adventure. He became uneasy and  thoughtful. He imagined that he was beginning to see things through  Digrung’s eyes, and that there were strange troubles immediately ahead.  The next time his eyes started to blur, he fought it down with his will,  and nothing happened.    The valley ascended with many windings toward the hills. It narrowed  considerably, and the wooded slopes on either side grew steeper and  higher. The stream shrunk to about twenty feet across, but it was  deeper—it was alive with motion, music, and bubbles. The electric  sensations caused by its water became more pronounced, almost  disagreeably so; but there was nowhere else to walk. With its deafening  confusion of sounds from the multitude of living creatures, the little  valley resembled a vast conversation hall of Nature. The life was still  more prolific than before; every square foot of space was a tangle of  struggling wills, both animal and vegetable. For a naturalist it would  have been paradise, for no two shapes were alike, and all were  fantastic, with individual character.    It looked as if life forms were being coined so fast by Nature that  there was not physical room for all. Nevertheless it was not as on  Earth, where a hundred seeds are scattered in order that one may be  sown. Here the young forms seemed to survive, while, to find  accommodation for them, the old ones perished; everywhere he looked they  were withering and dying, without any ostensible cause—they were simply  being killed by new life.    Other creatures sported so wildly, in front of his very eyes, that they  became of different “kingdoms” altogether. For example, a fruit was  lying on the ground, of the size and shape of a lemon, but with a  tougher skin. He picked it up, intending to eat the contained pulp; but  inside it was a fully formed young tree, just on the point of bursting  its shell. Maskull threw it away upstream. It floated back toward him;  by the time he was even with it, its downward motion had stopped and it  was swimming against the current. He fished it out and discovered that  it had sprouted six rudimentary legs.    Maskull sang no paeans of praise in honour of the gloriously overcrowded  valley. On the contrary, he felt deeply cynical and depressed. He  thought that the unseen power—whether it was called Nature, Life, Will,  or God—that was so frantic to rush forward and occupy this small,  vulgar, contemptible world, could not possess very high aims and was not  worth much. How this sordid struggle for an hour or two of physical  existence could ever be regarded as a deeply earnest and important  business was beyond his comprehension The atmosphere choked him, he  longed for air and space. Thrusting his way through to the side of the  ravine, he began to climb the overhanging cliff, swinging his way up  from tree to tree.    When he arrived at the top, Branchspell beat down on him with such  brutal, white intensity that he saw that there was no staying there. He  looked around, to ascertain what part of the country he had come to. He  had travelled about ten miles from the sea, as the crow flies. The bare,  undulating wolds sloped straight down toward it; the water glittered in  the distance; and on the horizon he was just able to make out Swaylone’s  Island. Looking north, the land continued sloping upward as far as he  could see. Over the crest—that is to say, some miles away—a line of  black, fantastic-shaped rocks of quite another character showed  themselves; this was probably Threal. Behind these again, against the  sky, perhaps fifty or even a hundred miles off, were the peaks of  Lichstorm, most of them covered with greenish snow that glittered in the  sunlight.    They were stupendously high and of weird contours. Most of them were  conical to the top, but from the top, great masses of mountain balanced  themselves at what looked like impossible angles—overhanging without  apparent support. A land like that promised something new, he thought:  extraordinary inhabitants. The idea took shape in his mind to go there,  and to travel as swiftly as possible, it might even be feasible to get  there before sunset. It was less the mountains themselves that attracted  him than the country which lay beyond—the prospect of setting eyes on  the blue sun, which he judged to be the wonder of wonders in Tormance.    The direct route was over the hills, but that was out of the question,  because of the killing heat and the absence of shade. He guessed,  however, that the valley would not take him far out of his way, and  decided to keep to that for the time being, much as he hated and feared  it. Into the hotbed of life, therefore, he once more swung himself.    Once down, he continued to follow the windings of the valley for several  miles through sunlight and shadow. The path became increasingly  difficult. The cliffs closed in on either side until they were less than  a hundred yards apart, while the bed of the ravine was blocked by  boulders, great and small, so that the little stream, which was now  diminished to the proportions of a brook, had to come down where and how  it could. The forms of life grew stranger. Pure plants and pure animals  disappeared by degrees, and their place was filled by singular creatures  that seemed to partake of both characters. They had limbs, faces, will,  and intelligence, but they remained for the greater part of their time  rooted in the ground by preference, and they fed only on soil and air.  Maskull saw no sexual organs and failed to understand how the young came  into existence.    Then he witnessed an astonishing sight. A large and fully developed  plant-animal appeared suddenly in front of him, out of empty space. He  could not believe his eyes, but stared at the creature for a long time  in amazement. It went on calmly moving and burrowing before him, as  thought it had been there all its life. Giving up the puzzle, Maskull  resumed his striding from rock to rock up the gorge, and then, quietly  and without warning, the same phenomenon occurred again. No longer could  he doubt that he was seeing miracles—that Nature was precipitating its  shapes into the world without making use of the medium of parentage....  No solution of the problem presented itself.    The brook too had altered in character. A trembling radiance came up  from its green water, like some imprisoned force escaping into the air.  He had not walked in it for some time; now he did so, to test its  quality. He felt new life entering his body, from his feet upward; it  resembled a slowly moving cordial, rather than mere heat. The sensation  was quite new in his experience, yet he knew by instinct what it was.  The energy emitted by the brook was ascending his body neither as friend  nor foe but simply because it happened to be the direct road to its  objective elsewhere. But, although it had no hostile intentions, it was  likely to prove a rough traveller—he was clearly conscious that its  passage through his body threatened to bring about some physical  transformation, unless he could do something to prevent it. Leaping  quickly out of the water, he leaned against a rock, tightened his  muscles, and braced himself against the impending change. At that very  moment the blurring again attacked his sight, and, while he was guarding  against that, his forehead sprouted out into a galaxy of new eyes. He  put his hand up and counted six, in addition to his old ones.    The danger was past and Maskull laughed, congratulating himself on  having got off so easily. Then he wondered what the new organs were  for—whether they were a good or a bad thing. He had not taken a dozen  steps up the ravine before he found out. Just as he was in the act of  jumping down from the top of a boulder, his vision altered and he came  to an automatic standstill. He was perceiving two worlds simultaneously.  With his own eyes he saw the gorge as before, with its rocks, brook,  plant-animals, sunshine, and shadows. But with his acquired eyes he saw  differently. All the details of the valley were visible, but the light  seemed turned down, and everything appeared faint, hard, and uncoloured.  The sun was obscured by masses of cloud which filled the whole sky. This  vapour was in violent and almost living motion. It was thick in  extension, but thin in texture; some parts, however, were far denser  than others, as the particles were crushed together or swept apart by  the motion. The green sparks from the brook, when closely watched, could  be distinguished individually, each one wavering up toward the clouds,  but the moment they got within them a fearful struggle seemed to begin.  The spark endeavoured to escape through to the upper air, while the  clouds concentrated around it whichever way it darted, trying to create  so dense a prison that further movement would be impossible. As far as  Maskull could detect, most of the sparks succeeded eventually in finding  their way out after frantic efforts; but one that he was looking at was  caught, and what happened was this. A complete ring of cloud surrounded  it, and, in spite of its furious leaps and flashes in all directions—as  if it were a live, savage creature caught in a net—nowhere could it find  an opening, but it dragged the enveloping cloud stuff with it, wherever  it went. The vapours continued to thicken around it, until they  resembled the black, heavy, compressed sky masses seen before a bad  thunderstorm. Then the green spark, which was still visible in the  interior, ceased its efforts, and remained for a time quite quiescent.  The cloud shape went on consolidating itself, and became nearly  spherical; as it grew heavier and stiller, it started slowly to descend  toward the valley floor. When it was directly opposite Maskull, with its  lower end only a few feet off the ground, its motion stopped altogether  and there was a complete pause for at least two minutes. Suddenly, like  a stab of forked lightning, the great cloud shot together, became small,  indented, and coloured, and as a plant-animal started walking around on  legs and rooting up the ground in search of food. The concluding stage  of the phenomenon he witnessed with his normal eyesight. It showed him  the creature’s appearing miraculously out of nowhere.    Maskull was shaken. His cynicism dropped from him and gave place to  curiosity and awe. “That was exactly like the birth of a thought,” he  said to himself, “but who was the thinker? Some great Living Mind is at  work in this spot. He has intelligence, for all his shapes are  different, and he has character, for all belong to the same general  type.... If I’m not wrong, and if it’s the force called Shaping or  Crystalman, I’ve seen enough to make me want to find out something more  about him.... It would be ridiculous to go on to other riddles before I  have solved these.”    A voice called out to him from behind, and, turning around, he saw a  human figure hastening toward him from some distance down the ravine. It  looked more like a man than a woman. He was rather tall, but nimble, and  was clothed in a dark, frocklike garment that reached from the neck to  below the knees. Around his head was rolled a turban. Maskull waited for  him, and when he was nearer went a little way to meet him.    Then he experienced another surprise, for this person, although clearly  a human being, was neither man nor woman, nor anything between the two,  but was unmistakably of a third positive sex, which was remarkable to  behold and difficult to understand. In order to translate into words the  sexual impression produced in Maskull’s mind by the stranger’s physical  aspect, it is necessary to coin a new pronoun, for none in earthly use  would be applicable. Instead of “he,” “she,” or “it,” therefore “ae”  will be used.    He found himself incapable of grasping at first why the bodily  peculiarities of this being should strike him as springing from sex, and  not from race, and yet there was no doubt about the fact itself. Body,  face, and eyes were absolutely neither male nor female, but something  quite different. Just as one can distinguish a man from a woman at the  first glance by some indefinable difference of expression and  atmospheres altogether apart from the contour of the figure, so the  stranger was separated in appearance from both. As with men and women,  the whole person expressed a latent sensuality, which gave body and face  alike their peculiar character.... Maskull decided that it was love—but  what love—love for whom? It was neither the shame-carrying passion of a  male, nor the deep-rooted instinct of a female to obey her destiny. It  was as real and irresistible as these, but quite different.    As he continued staring into those strange, archaic eyes, he had an  intuitive feeling that aer lover was no other than Shaping himself. It  came to him that the design of this love was not the continuance of the  race but the immortality on earth of the individual. No children were  produced by the act; the lover aerself was the eternal child. Further,  ae sought like a man, but received like a woman. All these things were  dimly and confusedly expressed by this extraordinary being, who seemed  to have dropped out of another age, when creation was different.    Of all the weird personalities Maskull had so far met in Tormance, this  one struck him as infinitely the most foreign—that is, the farthest  removed from him in spiritual structure. If they were to live together  for a hundred years, they could never be companions.    Maskull pulled himself out of his trancelike meditations and, viewing  the newcomer in greater detail, tried with his understanding to account  for the marvellous things told him by his intuitions. Ae possessed broad  shoulders and big bones, and was without female breasts, and so far ae  resembled a man. But the bones were so flat and angular that aer flesh  presented something of the character of a crystal, having plane surfaces  in place of curves. The body looked as if it had not been ground down by  the sea of ages into smooth and rounded regularity but had sprung  together in angles and facets as the result of a single, sudden idea.  The face too was broken and irregular. With his racial prejudices,  Maskull found little beauty in it, yet beauty there was, though neither  of a masculine nor of a feminine type, for it had the three essentials  of beauty: character, intelligence, and repose. The skin was copper-  coloured and strangely luminous, as if lighted from within. The face was  beardless, but the hair of the head was as long as a woman’s, and,  dressed in a single plait, fell down behind as far as the ankles. Ae  possessed only two eyes. That part of the turban which went across the  forehead protruded so far in front that it evidently concealed some  organ.    Maskull found it impossible to compute aer age. The frame appeared  active, vigorous, and healthy, the skin was clear and glowing; the eyes  were powerful and alert—ae might well be in early youth. Nevertheless,  the longer Maskull gazed, the more an impression of unbelievable  ancientness came upon him—aer real youth seemed as far away as the view  observed through a reversed telescope.    At last he addressed the stranger, though it was just as if he were  conversing with a dream. “To what sex do you belong?” he asked.    The voice in which the reply came was neither manly nor womanly, but was  oddly suggestive of a mystical forest horn, heard from a great distance.    “Nowadays there are men and women, but in the olden times the world was  peopled by ‘phaens.’ I think I am the only survivor of all those beings  who were then passing through Faceny’s mind.”    “Faceny?”    “Who is now miscalled Shaping or Crystalman. The superficial names  invented by a race of superficial creatures.”    “What’s your own name?”    “Leehallfae.”    “What?”    “Leehallfae. And yours is Maskull. I read in your mind that you have  just come through some wonderful adventures. You seem to possess  extraordinary luck. If it lasts long enough, perhaps I can make use of  it.”    “Do you think that my luck exists for your benefit?... But never mind  that now. It is your _sex_ that interests me. How do you satisfy your  desires?”    Leehallfae pointed to the concealed organ on her brow. “With that I  gather life from the streams that flow in all the hundred Matterplay  valleys. The streams spring direct from Faceny. My whole life has been  spent trying to find Faceny himself. I’ve hunted so long that if I were  to state the number of years you would believe I lied.”    Maskull looked at the phaen slowly. “In Ifdawn I met someone else from  Matterplay—a young man called Digrung. I absorbed him.”    “You can’t be telling me this out of vanity.”    “It was a fearful crime. What will come of it?”    Leehallfae gave a curious, wrinkled smile. “In Matterplay he will stir  inside you, for he smells the air. Already you have his eyes.... I knew  him.... Take care of yourself, or something more startling may happen.  Keep out of the water.”    “This seems to me a terrible valley, in which anything may happen.”    “Don’t torment yourself about Digrung. The valleys belong by right to  the phaens—the men here are interlopers. It is a good work to remove  them.”    Maskull continued thoughtful. “I say no more, but I see I will have to  be cautious. What did you mean about my helping you with my luck?”    “Your luck is fast weakening, but it may still be strong enough to serve  me. Together we will search for Threal.”    “Search for Threal—why, is it so hard to find?”    “I have told you that my whole life has been spent in the quest.”    “You said Faceny, Leehallfae.”    The phaen gazed at him with queer, ancient eyes, and smiled again. “This  stream, Maskull, like every other life stream in Matterplay, has its  source in Faceny. But as all these streams issue out from Threal, it is  in Threal that we must look for Faceny.”    “But what’s to prevent your finding Threal? Surely it’s a well-known  country?”    “It lies underground. Its communications with the upper world are few,  and where they are, no one that I have ever spoken to knows. I have  scoured the valleys and the hills. I have been to the very gates of  Lichstorm. I am old, so that your aged men would appear newborn infants  beside me, but I am as far from Threal as when I was a green youth,  dwelling among a throng of fellow phaens.”    “Then, if my luck is good, yours is very bad.... But when you have found  Faceny, what do you gain?”    Leehallfae looked at him in silence. The smile faded from aer face, and  its place was taken by such a look of unearthly pain and sorrow that  Maskull had no need to press his question. Ae was consumed by the grief  and yearning of a lover eternally separated from the loved one, the  scents and traces of whose person were always present. This passion  stamped aer features at that moment with a wild, stern, spiritual  beauty, far transcending any beauty of woman or man.    But the expression vanished suddenly, and then the abrupt contrast  showed Maskull the real Leehallfae. Aer sensuality was solitary, but  vulgar—it was like the heroism of a lonely nature, pursuing animal aims  with untiring persistence.    He looked at the phaen askance, and drummed his fingers against his  thigh. “Well, we will go together. We may find something, and in any  case I shan’t be sorry to converse with such a singular individual as  yourself.”    “But I should warn you, Maskull. You and I are of different creations. A  phaen’s body contains the whole of life, a man’s body contains only the  half of life—the other half is in woman. Faceny may be too strong a  draught for your body to endure.... Do you not feel this?”    “I am dull with my different feelings. I must take what precautions I  can, and chance the rest.” He bent down, and, taking hold of the phaen’s  thin and ragged robe, tore off a broad strip, which he proceeded to  swathe in folds around his forehead. “I’m not forgetting your advice,  Leehallfae. I would not like to start the walk as Maskull and finish it  as Digrung.”    The phaen gave a twisted grin, and they began to move upstream. The road  was difficult. They had to stride from boulder to boulder, and found it  warm work. Occasionally a worse obstacle presented itself, which they  could surmount only by climbing. There was no more conversation for a  long time. Maskull, as far as possible, adopted his companion’s counsel  to avoid the water, but here and there he was forced to set foot in it.  The second or third time he did so, he felt a sudden agony in his arm,  where it had been wounded by Krag. His eyes grew joyful; his fears  vanished; and he began deliberately to tread the stream.    Leehallfae stroked aer chin and watched him with screwed-up eyes, trying  to comprehend what had happened. “Is your luck speaking to you, Maskull,  or what is the matter?”    “Listen. You are a being of antique experience, and ought to know, if  anyone does. What is Muspel?”    The phaen’s face was blank. “I don’t know the name.”    “It is another world of some sort.”    “That cannot be. There is only this one world—Faceny’s.”    Maskull came up to aer, linked arms, and began to talk. “I’m glad I fell  in with you, Leehallfae, for this valley and everything connected with  it need a lot of explaining. For example, in this spot there are hardly  any organic forms left—why have they all disappeared? You call this  brook a ‘life stream,’ yet the nearer its source we get, the less life  it produces. A mile or two lower down we had those spontaneous plant-  animals appearing out of nowhere, while right down by the sea, plants  and animals were tumbling over one another. Now, if all this is  connected in some mysterious way or other with your Faceny, it seems to  me he must have a most paradoxical nature. His essence doesn’t start  creating shapes until it has become thoroughly weakened and watered....  But perhaps both of us are talking nonsense.”    Leehallfae shook aer head. “Everything hangs together. The stream is  life, and it is throwing off sparks of life all the time. When these  sparks are caught and imprisoned by matter, they become living shapes.  The nearer the stream is to its source, the more terrible and vigorous  is its life. You’ll see for yourself when we reach the head of the  valley that there are no living shapes there at all. That means that  there is no kind of matter tough enough to capture and hold the terrible  sparks that are to be found there. Lower down the stream, most of the  sparks are vigorous enough to escape to the upper air, but some are held  when they are a little way up, and these burst suddenly into shapes. I  myself am of this nature. Lower down still, toward the sea, the stream  has lost a great part of its vital power and the sparks are lazy and  sluggish. They spread out, rather than rise into the air. There is  hardly any kind of matter, however delicate, that is incapable of  capturing these feeble sparks, and they are captured in multitudes—that  accounts for the innumerable living shapes you see there. But not only  that—the sparks are passed from one body to another by way of  generation, and can never hope to cease being so until they are worn out  by decay. Lowest of all, you have the Sinking Sea itself. There the  degenerate and enfeebled life of the Matterplay streams has for its body  the whole sea. So weak is it’s power that it can’t succeed in creating  any shapes at all but you can see its ceaseless, futile attempts to do  so, in those spouts.”    “So the slow development of men and women is due to the feebleness of  the life germ in their case?”    “Exactly. It can’t attain all its desires at once. And now you can see  how immeasurably superior are the phaens, who spring spontaneously from  the more electric and vigorous sparks.”    “But where does the matter come from that imprisons these sparks?”    “When life dies, it becomes matter. Matter itself dies, but its place is  constantly taken by new matter.”    “But if life comes from Faceny, how can it die at all?”    “Life is the thoughts of Faceny, and once these thoughts have left his  brain they are nothing—mere dying embers.”    “This is a cheerless philosophy,” said Maskull. “But who is Faceny  himself, then, and why does he think at all?”    Leehallfae gave another wrinkled smile. “That I’ll explain too. Faceny  is of this nature. He faces Nothingness in all directions. He has no  back and no sides, but is all face; and this face is his shape. It must  necessarily be so, for nothing else can exist between him and  Nothingness. His face is all eyes, for he eternally contemplates  Nothingness. He draws his inspirations from it; in no other way could he  feel himself. For the same reason, phaens and even men love to be in  empty places and vast solitudes, for each one is a little Faceny.”    “That rings true,” said Maskull.    “Thoughts flow perpetually from Faceny’s face backward. Since his face  is on all sides, however, they flow into his interior. A draught of  thought thus continuously flows from Nothingness to the inside of  Faceny, which is the world. The thoughts become shapes, and people the  world. This outer world, therefore, which is lying all around us, is not  outside at all, as it happens, but inside. The visible universe is like  a gigantic stomach, and the real outside of the world we shall never  see.”    Maskull pondered deeply for a while.    “Leehallfae, I fail to see what you personally have to hope for, since  you are nothing more than a discarded, dying thought.”    “Have you never loved a woman?” asked the phaen, regarding him fixedly.    “Perhaps I have.”    “When you loved, did you have no high moments?”    “That’s asking the same question in other words.”    “In those moments you were approaching Faceny. If you could have drawn  nearer still, would you not have done so?”    “I would, regardless of the consequences.”    “Even if you personally had nothing to hope for?”    “But I would have that to hope for.”    Leehallfae walked on in silence.    “A man is the half of Life,” ae broke out suddenly. “A woman is the  other half of life, but a phaen is the whole of life. Moreover, when  life becomes split into halves, something else has dropped out of  it—something that belongs only to the whole. Between your love and mine  there is no comparison. If even your sluggish blood is drawn to Faceny,  without stopping to ask what will come of it, how do you suppose it is  with me?”    “I don’t question the genuineness of your passion,” replied Maskull,  “but it’s a pity you can’t see your way to carry it forward into the  next world.”    Leehallfae gave a distorted grin, expressing heaven knows what emotion.  “Men think what they like, but phaens are so made that they can see the  world only as it really is.”    That ended the conversation.    The sun was high in the sky, and they appeared to be approaching the  head of the ravine. Its walls had still further closed in and, except at  those moments when Branchspell was directly behind them, they strode  along all the time in deep shade; but still it was disagreeably hot and  relaxing. All life had ceased. A beautiful, fantastic spectacle was  presented by the cliff faces, the rocky ground, and the boulders that  choked the entire width of the gorge. They were of a snow-white  crystalline limestone, heavily scored by veins of bright, gleaming blue.  The rivulet was no longer green, but a clear, transparent crystal. Its  noise was musical, and altogether it looked most romantic and charming,  but Leehallfae seemed to find something else in it—aer features grew  more and more set and tortured.    About half an hour after all the other life forms had vanished, another  plant-animal was precipitated out of space, in front of their eyes. It  was as tall as Maskull himself, and had a brilliant and vigorous  appearance, as befitted a creature just out of Nature’s mint. It started  to walk about; but hardly had it done so when it burst silently asunder.  Nothing remained of it—the whole body disappeared instantaneously into  the same invisible mist from which it had sprung.    “That bears out what you said,” commented Maskull, turning rather pale.    “Yes,” answered Leehallfae, “we have now come to the region of terrible  life.”    “Then, since you’re right in this, I must believe all that you’ve been  telling me.”    As he uttered the words, they were just turning a bend of the ravine.  There now loomed up straight ahead a perpendicular cliff about three  hundred feet in height, composed of white, marbled rock. It was the head  of the valley, and beyond it they could not proceed.    “In return for my wisdom,” said the phaen, “you will now lend me your  luck.”    They walked up to the base of the cliff, and Maskull looked at it  reflectively. It was possible to climb it, but the ascent would be  difficult. The now tiny brook issued from a hole in the rock only a few  feet up. Apart from its musical running, not a sound was to be heard.  The floor of the gorge was in shadow, but about halfway up the precipice  the sun was shining.    “What do you want me to do?” demanded Maskull. “Everything is now in  your hands, and I have no suggestions to make. Now it’s your luck that  must help us.”    Maskull continued gazing up a little while longer. “We had better wait  till the afternoon, Leehallfae. I’ll probably have to climb to the top,  but it’s too hot at present—and besides, I’m tired. I’ll snatch a few  hours’ sleep. After that, we’ll see.”    Leehallfae seemed annoyed, but raised no opposition.        Chapter 17. CORPANG    Maskull did not awaken till long after Blodsombre. Leehallfae was  standing by his side, looking down at him. It was doubtful whether ae  had slept at all.    “What time is it?” Maskull asked, rubbing his eyes and sitting up.    “The day is passing,” was the vague reply.    Maskull got on to his feet, and gazed up at the cliff. “Now I’m going to  climb that. No need for both of us to risk our necks, so you wait here,  and if I find anything on top I’ll call you.”    A phaen glanced at him strangely. “There’s nothing up there except a  bare hillside. I’ve been there often. Have you anything special in  mind?”    “Heights often bring me inspiration. Sit down, and wait.”    Refreshed by his sleep, Maskull immediately attacked the face of the  cliff, and took the first twenty feet at a single rush. Then it grew  precipitous, and the ascent demanded greater circumspection and  intelligence. There were few hand- or footholds: he had to reflect  before every step. On the other hand, it was sound rock, and he was no  novice at the sport. Branchspell glared full on the wall, so that it  half blinded him with its glittering whiteness.    After many doubts and pauses he drew near the top. He was hot, sweating  copiously, and rather dizzy. To reach a ledge he caught hold of two  projecting rocks, one with each hand, at the same time scrambling  upward, his legs between the rocks. The left-hand rock, which was the  larger of the two, became dislodged by his weight, and, flying like a  huge, dark shadow past his head, crashed down with a terrifying sound to  the foot of the precipice, followed by an avalanche of smaller stones.  Maskull steadied himself as well as he could, but it was some moments  before he dared to look down behind him.    At first he could not distinguish Leehallfae. Then he caught sight of  legs and hindquarters a few feet up the cliff from the bottom. He  perceived that the phaen had aer head in a cavity and was scrutinising  something, and waited for aer to reappear.    Ae emerged, looked up to Maskull, and called out in aer hornlike voice,  “The entrance is here!”    “I’m coming down!” roared Maskull. “Wait for me!”    He descended swiftly—without taking too much care, for he thought he  recognised his “luck” in this discovery—and within twenty minutes was  standing beside the phaen.    “What happened?”    “The rock you dislodged struck this other rock just above the spring. It  tore it out of its bed. See—now there’s room for us to get in!”    “Don’t get excited!” said Maskull. “It’s a remarkable accident, but we  have plenty of time. Let me look.”    He peered into the hole, which was large enough to admit a big man  without stooping. Contrasted with the daylight outside it was dark, yet  a peculiar glow pervaded the place, and he could see well enough. A rock  tunnel went straight forward into the bowels of the hill, out of sight.  The valley brook did not flow along the floor of this tunnel, as he had  expected, but came up as a spring just inside the entrance.    “Well Leehallfae, not much need to deliberate, eh? Still, observe that  your stream parts company with us here.”    As he turned around for an answer he noticed that his companion was  trembling from head to foot.    “Why, what’s the matter?”    Leehallfae pressed a hand to aer heart. “The stream leaves us, but what  makes the stream what it is continues with us. Faceny is there.”    “But surely you don’t expect to see him in person? Why are you shaking?”    “Perhaps it will be too much for me after all.”    “Why? How is it affecting you?”    The phaen took him by the shoulder and held him at arm’s length,  endeavouring to study him with aer unsteady eyes. “Faceny’s thoughts are  obscure. I am his lover, you are a lover of women, yet he grants to you  what he denies to me.”    “What does he grant to me?”    “To see him, and go on living. I shall die. But it’s immaterial.  Tomorrow both of us will be dead.”    Maskull impatiently shook himself free. “Your sensations may be reliable  in your own case, but how do you know I shall die?”    “Life is flaming up inside you,” replied Leehallfae, shaking aer head.  “But after it has reached its climax—perhaps tonight—it will sink  rapidly and you’ll die tomorrow. As for me, if I enter Threal I shan’t  come out again. A smell of death is being wafted to me out of this  hole.”    “You talk like a frightened man. I smell nothing.”    “I am not frightened,” said Leehallfae quietly—ae had been gradually  recovering aer tranquillity—“but when one has lived as long as I have,  it is a serious matter to die. Every year one puts out new roots.”    “Decide what you’re going to do,” said Maskull with a touch of contempt,  “for I’m going in at once.”    The phaen gave an odd, meditative stare down the ravine, and after that  walked into the cavern without another word. Maskull, scratching his  head, followed close at aer heels.    The moment they stepped across the bubbling spring, the atmosphere  altered. Without becoming stale or unpleasant, it grew cold, clear and  refined, and somehow suggested austere and tomblike thoughts. The  daylight disappeared at the first bend in the tunnel. After that,  Maskull could not say where the light came from. The air itself must  have been luminous, for though it was as light as full moon on Earth,  neither he nor Leehallfae cast a shadow. Another peculiarity of the  light was that both the walls of the tunnel and their own bodies  appeared colourless. Everything was black and white, like a lunar  landscape. This intensified the solemn, funereal feelings created by the  atmosphere.    After they had proceeded for about ten minutes, the tunnel began to  widen out. The roof was high above their heads, and six men could have  walked side by side. Leehallfae was visibly weakening. Ae dragged  aerself along slowly and painfully, with sunken head.    Maskull caught hold of aer. “You can’t go on like that. Better let me  take you back.”    The phaen smiled, and staggered. “I’m dying.”    “Don’t talk like that. It’s only a passing indisposition. Let me take  you back to the daylight.”    “No, help me forward. I wish to see Faceny.”    “The sick must have their way,” said Maskull. Lifting aer bodily in his  arms, he walked quickly along for another hundred yards or so. They then  emerged from the tunnel and faced a world the parallel of which he had  never set eyes upon before.    “Set me down!” directed Leehallfae feebly. “Here I’ll die.”    Maskull obeyed, and laid aer down at full length on the rocky ground.  The phaen raised aerself with difficulty on one arm, and stared with  fast-glazing eyes at the mystic landscape.    Maskull looked too, and what he saw was a vast, undulating plain,  lighted as if by the moon—but there was of course no moon, and there  were no shadows. He made out running streams in the distance. Beside  them were trees of a peculiar kind; they were rooted in the ground, but  the branches also were aerial roots, and there were no leaves. No other  plants could be seen. The soil was soft, porous rock, resembling pumice.  Beyond a mile or two in any direction the light merged into obscurity.  At their back a great rocky wall extended on either hand; but it was not  square like a wall, but full of bays and promontories like an indented  line of sea cliffs. The roof of this huge underworld was out of sight.  Here and there a mighty shaft of naked rock, fantastically weathered,  towered aloft into the gloom, doubtless serving to support the roof.  There were no colours—every detail of the landscape was black, white, or  grey. The scene appeared so still, so solemn and religious, that all his  feelings quieted down to absolute tranquillity.    Leehallfae fell back suddenly. Maskull dropped on his knees, and  helplessly watched the last flickerings of aer spirit, going out like a  candle in foul air. Death came.... He closed the eyes. The awful grin of  Crystalman immediately fastened upon the phaen’s dead features.    While Maskull was still kneeling, he became conscious of someone  standing beside him. He looked up quickly and saw a man, but did not at  once rise.    “Another phaen dead,” said the newcomer in a grave, toneless, and  intellectual voice.    Maskull got up.    The man was short and thickset but emaciated. His forehead was not  disfigured by any organs. He was middle-aged. The features were  energetic and rather coarse—yet it seemed to Maskull as though a pure,  hard life had done something toward refining them. His sanguine eyes  carried a twisted, puzzled look; some unanswerable problem was  apparently in the forefront of his brain. His face was hairless; the  hair of his head was short and manly; his brow was wide. He was clothed  in a black, sleeveless robe, and bore a long staff in his hand. There  was an air of cleanness and austerity about the whole man that was  attractive.    He went on speaking dispassionately to Maskull, and, while doing so,  kept passing his hand reflectively over his cheeks and chin. “They all  find their way here to die. They come from Matterplay. There they live  to an incredible age. Partly on that account, and partly because of  their spontaneous origin, they regard themselves as the favoured  children of Faceny. But when they come here to find him, they die at  once.”    “I think this one is the last of the race. But whom do I speak to?”    “I am Corpang. Who are you, where do you come from, and what are you  doing here?”    “My name is Maskull. My home is on the other side of the universe. As  for what I am doing here—I accompanied Leehallfae, that phaen, from  Matterplay.”    “But a man doesn’t accompany a phaen out of friendship. What do you want  in Threal?”    “Then this is Threal?”    “Yes.”    Maskull remained silent.    Corpang studied his face with rough, curious eyes. “Are you ignorant, or  merely reticent, Maskull?”    “I came here to ask questions, and not to answer them.”    The stillness of the place was almost oppressive. Not a breeze stirred,  and not a sound came through the air. Their voices had been lowered, as  though they were in a cathedral.    “Then do you want my society, or not?” asked Corpang.    “Yes, if you can fit in with my mood, which is—not to talk about  myself.”    “But you must at least tell me where you want to go to.”    “I want to see what is to be seen here, and then go on to Lichstorm.”    “I can guide you through, if that’s all you want. Come, let us start.”    “First let’s do our duty and bury the dead, if possible.”    “Turn around,” directed Corpang.    Maskull looked around quickly. Leehallfae’s body had disappeared.    “What does this mean—what has happened?”    “The body has returned to whence it came. There was nowhere here for it  to be, so it has vanished. No burial will be required.”    “Was the phaen an illusion, then?”    “In no sense.”    “Well, explain quickly, then, what has taken place. I seem to be going  mad.”    “There’s nothing unintelligible in it, if you’ll only listen calmly. The  phaen belonged, body and soul, to the outside, visible world—to Faceny.  This underworld is not Faceny’s world, but Thire’s, and Faceny’s  creatures cannot breathe its atmosphere. As this applies not only to  whole bodies, but even to the last particles of bodies, the phaen has  dissolved into Nothingness.”    “But don’t you and I belong to the outside world too?”    “We belong to all three worlds.”    “What three worlds—what do you mean?”    “There are three worlds,” said Corpang composedly. “The first is  Faceny’s, the second is Amfuse’s, the third is Thire’s. From him Threal  gets its name.”    “But this is mere nomenclature. In what sense are there three worlds?”    Corpang passed his hand over his forehead. “All this we can discuss as  we go along. It’s a torment to me to be standing still.”    Maskull stared again at the spot where Leehallfae’s body had lain, quite  bewildered at the extraordinary disappearance. He could scarcely tear  himself away from the place, so mysterious was it. Not until Corpang  called to him a second time did he make up his mind to follow him.    They set off from the rock wall straight across the airlit plain,  directing their course toward the nearest trees. The subdued light, the  absence of shadows, the massive shafts, springing grey-white out of the  jetlike ground, the fantastic trees, the absence of a sky, the deathly  silence, the knowledge that he was underground—the combination of all  these things predisposed Maskull’s mind to mysticism, and he prepared  himself with some anxiety to hear Corpang’s explanation of the land and  its wonders. He already began to grasp that the reality of the outside  world and the reality of this world were two quite different things.    “In what sense are there three worlds?” he demanded, repeating his  former question.    Corpang smote the end of his staff on the ground. “First of all,  Maskull, what is your motive for asking? If it’s mere intellectual  curiosity, tell me, for we mustn’t play with awful matters.”    “No, it isn’t that,” said Maskull slowly. “I’m not a student. My journey  is no holiday tour.”    “Isn’t there blood on your soul?” asked Corpang, eying him intently.    The blood rose steadily to Maskull’s face, but in that light it caused  it to appear black.    “Unfortunately there is, and not a little.”    The other’s face was all wrinkles, but he made no comment.    “And so you see,” went on Maskull, with a short laugh, “I’m in the very  best condition for receiving your instruction.”    Corpang still paused. “Underneath your crimes I see a man,” he said,  after a few minutes. “On that account, and because we are commanded to  help one another, I won’t leave you at present, though I little thought  to be walking with a murderer.... Now to your question.... Whatever a  man sees with his eyes, Maskull, he sees in three ways—length, breadth,  depth. Length is existence, breadth is relation, depth is feeling.”    “Something of the sort was told me by Earthrid, the musician, who came  from Threal.”    “I don’t know him. What else did he tell you?”    “He went on to apply it to music. Continue, and pardon the  interruption.”    “These three states of perception are the three worlds. Existence is  Faceny’s world, relation is Amfuse’s world, feeling is Thire’s world.”    “Can’t we come down to hard facts?” said Maskull, frowning. “I  understand no more than I did before what you mean by three worlds.”    “There are no harder facts than the ones I am giving you. The first  world is visible, tangible Nature. It was created by Faceny out of  nothingness, and therefore we call it Existence.”    “That I understand.”    “The second world is Love—by which I don’t mean lust. Without love,  every individual would be entirely self-centred and unable deliberately  to act on others. Without love, there would be no sympathy—not even  hatred, anger, or revenge would be possible. These are all imperfect and  distorted forms of pure love. Interpenetrating Faceny’s world of Nature,  therefore, we have Amfuse’s world of Love, or Relation.”    “What grounds have you for assuming that this so-called second world is  not contained in the first?”    “They are contradictory. A natural man lives for himself; a lover lives  for others.”    “It may be so. It’s rather mystical. But go on—who is Thire?”    “Length and breadth together without depth give flatness. Life and love  without feeling produce shallow, superficial natures. Feeling is the  need of men to stretch out toward their creator.”    “You mean prayer and worship?”    “I mean intimacy with Thire. This feeling is not to be found in either  the first or second world, therefore it is a third world. Just as depth  is the line between object and subject, feeling is the line between  Thire and man.”    “But what is Thire himself?”    “Thire is the afterworld.”    “I still don’t understand,” said Maskull. “Do you believe in three  separate gods, or are these merely three ways of regarding one God?”    “There are three gods, for they are mutually antagonistic. Yet they are  somehow united.”    Maskull reflected a while. “How have you arrived at these conclusions?”    “None other are possible in Threal, Maskull.”    “Why in Threal—what is there peculiar here?”    “I will show you presently.”    They walked on for above a mile in silence, while Maskull digested what  had been said. When they came to the first trees, which grew along the  banks of a small stream of transparent water, Corpang halted.    “That bandage around your forehead has long been unnecessary,” he  remarked.    Maskull removed it. He found that the line of his brow was smooth and  uninterrupted, as it had never yet been since his arrival in Tormance.    “How has this come about—and how did you know it?”    “They were Faceny’s organs. They have vanished, just as the phaen’s body  vanished.”    Maskull kept rubbing his forehead. “I feel more human without them. But  why isn’t the rest of my body affected?”    “Because its living will contains the element of Thire.”    “Why are we stopping here?”    Corpang broke off the tip of one of the aerial roots of a tree, and  proffered it to him. “Eat this, Maskull.”    “For food, or something else?”    “Food for body and soul.”    Maskull bit into the root. It was white and hard; its white sap was  bleeding. It had no taste, but after eating it, he experienced a change  of perception. The landscape, without alteration of light or outline,  became several degrees more stern and sacred. When he looked at Corpang  he was impressed by his aspect of Gothic awfulness, but the perplexed  expression was still in his eyes.    “Do you spend all your time here, Corpang?”    “Occasionally I go above, but not often.”    “What fastens you to this gloomy world?”    “The search for Thire.”    “Then it’s still a search?”    “Let us walk on.”    As they resumed their journey across the dim, gradually rising plain,  the conversation became even more earnest in character than before.  “Although I was not born here,” proceeded Corpang, “I’ve lived here for  twenty-five years, and during all that time I have been drawing nearer  to Thire, as I hope. But there is this peculiarity about it—the first  stages are richer in fruit and more promising than the later ones. The  longer a man seeks Thire, the more he seems to absent himself. In the  beginning he is felt and known, sometimes as a shape, sometimes as a  voice, sometimes an overpowering emotion. Later on all is dry, dark, and  harsh in the soul. Then you would think that Thire was a million miles  off.”    “How do you explain that?”    “When everything is darkest, he may be nearest, Maskull.”    “But this is troubling you?”    “My days are spent in torture.”    “You still persist, though? This day darkness can’t be the ultimate  state?”    “My questions will be answered.”    A silence ensued.    “What do you propose to show me?” asked Maskull.    “The land is about to grow wilder. I am taking you to the Three Figures,  which were carved and erected by an earlier race of men. There, we will  pray.”    “And what then?”    “If you are truehearted, you will see things you will not easily  forget.”    They had been walking slightly uphill in a sort of trough between two  parallel, gently sloping downs. The trough now deepened, while the hills  on either side grew steeper. They were in an ascending valley and, as it  curved this way and that, the landscape was shut off from view. They  came to a little spring, bubbling up from the ground. It formed a  trickling brook, which was unlike all other brooks in that it was  flowing up the valley instead of down. Before long it was joined by  other miniature rivulets, so that in the end it became a fair-sized  stream. Maskull kept looking at it, and puckering his forehead.    “Nature has other laws here, it seems?”    “Nothing can exist here that is not a compound of the three worlds.”    “Yet the water is flowing somewhere.”    “I can’t explain it, but there are three wills in it.”    “Is there no such thing as pure Thire-matter?”    “Thire cannot exist without Amfuse, and Amfuse cannot exist without  Faceny.”    Maskull thought this over for some minutes. “That must be so,” he said  at last. “Without life there can be no love, and without love there can  be no religious feeling.”    In the half light of the land, the tops of the hills containing the  valley presently attained such a height that they could not be seen. The  sides were steep and craggy, while the bed of the valley grew narrower  at every step. Not a living organism was visible. All was unnatural and  sepulchral.    Maskull said, “I feel as if I were dead, and walking in another world.”    “I still do not know what you are doing here,” answered Corpang.    “Why should I go on making a mystery of it? I came to find Surtur.”    “That name I’ve heard—but under what circumstances?”    “You forget?”    Corpang walked along, his eyes fixed on the ground, obviously troubled.  “Who is Surtur?”    Maskull shook his head, and said nothing.    The valley shortly afterward narrowed, so that the two men, touching  fingertips in the middle, could have placed their free hands on the rock  walls on either side. It threatened to terminate in a cul-de-sac, but  just when the road seemed least promising, and they were shut in by  cliffs on all sides, a hitherto unperceived bend brought them suddenly  into the open. They emerged through a mere crack in the line of  precipices.    A sort of huge natural corridor was running along at right angles to the  way they had come; both ends faded into obscurity after a few hundred  yards. Right down the centre of this corridor ran a chasm with  perpendicular sides; its width varied from thirty to a hundred feet, but  its bottom could not be seen. On both sides of the chasm, facing one  another, were platforms of rock, twenty feet or so in width; they too  proceeded in both directions out of sight. Maskull and Corpang emerged  onto one of these platforms. The shelf opposite was a few feet higher  than that on which they stood. The platforms were backed by a double  line of lofty and unclimbable cliffs, whose tops were invisible.    The stream, which had accompanied them through the gap, went straight  forward, but, instead of descending the wall of the chasm as a  waterfall, it crossed from side to side like a liquid bridge. It then  disappeared through a cleft in the cliffs on the opposite side.    To Maskull’s mind, however, even more wonderful than this unnatural  phenomenon was the absence of shadows, which was more noticeable here  than on the open plain. It made the place look like a hall of phantoms.    Corpang, without delay, led the way along the shelf to the left. When  they had walked about a mile, the gulf widened to two hundred feet.  Three large rocks loomed up on the ledge opposite; they resembled three  upright giants, standing motionless side by side on the extreme edge of  the chasm. Corpang and Maskull drew nearer, and then Maskull saw that  they were statues. Each was about thirty feet high, and the workmanship  was of the rudest. They represented naked men, but the limbs and trunks  had been barely chipped into shape—the faces alone had had care bestowed  on them, and even these faces were merely generalised. It was obviously  the work of primitive artists. The statues stood erect with knees closed  and arms hanging straight down their sides. All three were exactly  alike.    As soon as they were directly opposite, Corpang halted.    “Is this a representation of your three Beings?” asked Maskull, awed by  the spectacle in spite of his constitutional audacity.    “Ask no questions, but kneel,” replied Corpang. He dropped onto his own  knees, but Maskull remained standing.    Corpang covered his eyes with one hand, and prayed silently. After a few  minutes the light sensibly faded. Then Maskull knelt as well, but he  continued looking.    It grew darker and darker, until all was like the blackest night. Sight  and sound no longer existed; he was alone with his own spirit.    Then one of the three Colossi came slowly into sight again. But it had  ceased to be a statue—it was a living person. Out of the blackness of  space a gigantic head and chest emerged, illuminated by a mystic, rosy  glow, like a mountain peak bathed by the rising sun. As the light grew  stronger Maskull saw that the flesh was translucent and that the glow  came from within. The limbs of the apparition were wreathed in mist.    Before long the features of the face stood out distinctly. It was that  of a beardless youth of twenty years. It possessed the beauty of a girl  and the daring force of a man; it bore a mocking, cryptic smile. Maskull  felt the fresh, mysterious thrill of mingled pain and rapture of one who  awakes from a deep sleep in midwinter and sees the gleaming, dark,  delicate colours of the half-dawn. The vision smiled, kept still, and  looked beyond him. He began to shudder, with delight—and many emotions.  As he gazed, his poetic sensibility acquired such a nervous and  indefinable character that he could endure it no more; he burst into  tears.    When he looked up again the image had nearly disappeared, and in a few  moments more he was plunged back into total darkness.    Shortly afterward a second statue reappeared. It too was transfigured  into a living form, but Maskull was unable to see the details of its  face and body, because of the brightness of the light that radiated from  them. This light, which started as pale gold, ended as flaming golden  fire. It illumined the whole underground landscape. The rock ledges, the  cliffs, himself and Corpang on their knees, the two unlighted  statues—all appeared as if in sunlight, and the shadows were black and  strongly defined. The light carried heat with it, but a singular heat.  Maskull was unaware of any rise in temperature, but he felt his heart  melting to womanish softness. His male arrogance and egotism faded  imperceptibly away; his personality seemed to disappear. What was left  behind was not freedom of spirit or lightheartedness, but a passionate  and nearly savage mental state of pity and distress. He felt a  tormenting desire to serve. All this came from the heat of the statue,  and was without an object. He glanced anxiously around him, and fastened  his eyes on Corpang. He put a hand on his shoulder and aroused him from  his praying.    “You must know what I am feeling, Corpang.”    Corpang smiled sweetly, but said nothing.    “I care nothing for my own affairs any more. How can I help you?”    “So much the better for you, Maskull, if you respond so quickly to the  invisible worlds.”    As soon as he had spoken, the figure began to vanish, and the light to  die away from the landscape. Maskull’s emotion slowly subsided, but it  was not until he was once more in complete darkness that he became  master of himself again. Then he felt ashamed of his boyish exhibition  of enthusiasm, and thought ruefully that there must be something wanting  in his character. He got up onto his feet.    The very moment that he arose, a man’s voice sounded, not a yard from  his ear. It was hardly raised above a whisper, but he could distinguish  that it was not Corpang’s. As he listened he was unable to prevent  himself from physically trembling.    “Maskull, you are to die,” said the unseen speaker.    “Who is speaking?”    “You have only a few hours of life left. Don’t trifle the time away.”    Maskull could bring nothing out.    “You have despised life,” went on the low-toned voice. “Do you really  imagine that this mighty world has no meaning, and that life is a joke?”    “What must I do?”    “Repent your murders, commit no fresh ones, pay honour to...”    The voice died away. Maskull waited in silence for it to speak again.  All remained still, however, and the speaker appeared to have taken his  departure. Supernatural horror seized him; he fell into a sort of  catalepsy.    At that moment he saw one of the statues fading away, from a pale, white  glow to darkness. He had not previously seen it shining.    In a few more minutes the normal light of the land returned. Corpang got  up, and shook him out of his trance.    Maskull looked around, but saw no third person. “Whose statue was the  last?” he demanded.    “Thire’s.”    “Did you hear me speaking?”    “I heard your voice, but no one else’s.”    “I’ve just had my death foretold, so I suppose I have not long to live.  Leehallfae prophesied the same thing.”    Corpang shook his head. “What value do you set on life?” he asked.    “Very little. But it’s a fearful thing all the same.”    “Your death is?”    “No, but this warning.”    They stopped talking. A profound silence reigned. Neither of the two men  seemed to know what to do next, or where to go. Then both of them heard  the sound of drumming. It was slow, emphatic, and impressive, a long way  off and not loud, but against the background of quietness, very marked.  It appeared to come from some point out of sight, to the left of where  they were standing, but on the same rock shelf. Maskull’s heart beat  quickly.    “What can that sound be?” asked Corpang, peering into the obscurity.    “It is Surtur.”    “Once again, who is Surtur?”    Maskull clutched his arm and pressed him to silence. A strange radiance  was in the air, in the direction of the drumming. It increased in  intensity and gradually occupied the whole scene. Things were no longer  seen by Their’s light, but by this new light. It cast no shadows.    Corpang’s nostrils swelled, and he held himself more proudly. “What fire  is that?”    “It is Muspel-light.”    They both glanced instinctively at the three statues. In the strange  glow they had undergone a change. The face of each figure was clothed in  the sordid and horrible Crystalman mask.    Corpang cried out and put his hand over his eyes. “What can this mean?”  he asked a minute later.    “It must mean that life is wrong, and the creator of life too, whether  he is one person or three.”    Corpang looked again, like a man trying to accustom himself to a  shocking sight. “Dare we believe this?”    “You must,” replied Maskull. “You have always served the highest, and  you must continue to do so. It has simply turned out that Thire is not  the highest.”    Corpang’s face became swollen with a kind of coarse anger. “Life is  clearly false—I have been seeking Thire for a lifetime, and now I  find—this.”    “You have nothing to reproach yourself with. Crystalman has had eternity  to practice his cunning in, so it’s no wonder if a man can’t see  straight, even with the best intentions. What have you decided to do?”    “The drumming seems to be moving away. Will you follow it, Maskull?”    “Yes.”    “But where will it take us?”    “Perhaps out of Threal altogether.”    “It sounds to me more real than reality,” said Corpang. “Tell me, who is  Surtur?”    “Surtur’s world, or Muspel, we are told, is the original of which this  world is a distorted copy. Crystalman is life, but Surtur is other than  life.”    “How do you know this?”    “It has sprung together somehow—from inspiration, from experience, from  conversation with the wise men of your planet. Every hour it grows truer  for me and takes a more definite shape.”    Corpang stood up squarely, facing the three Figures with a harsh,  energetic countenance, stamped all over with resolution. “I believe you,  Maskull. No better proof is required than that. Thire is not the  highest; he is even in a certain sense the lowest. Nothing but the  thoroughly false and base could stoop to such deceits.... I am coming  with you—but don’t play the traitor. These signs may be for you, and not  for me at all, and if you leave me—”    “I make no promises. I don’t ask you to come with me. If you prefer to  stay in your little world, or if you have any doubts about it, you had  better not come.”    “Don’t talk like that. I shall never forget your service to me... Let us  make haste, or we shall lose the sound.”    Corpang started off more eagerly than Maskull. They walked fast in the  direction of the drumming. For upward of two miles the path went along  the ledge without any change of level. The mysterious radiance gradually  departed, and was replaced by the normal light of Threal. The rhythmical  beats continued, but a very long way ahead—neither was able to diminish  the distance.    “What kind of man are you?” Corpang suddenly broke out.    “In what respect?”    “How do you come to be on such terms with the Invisible? How is it that  I’ve never had this experience before I met you, in spite of my never-  ending prayers and mortifications? In what way are you superior to me?”    “To hear voices perhaps can’t be made a profession,” replied Maskull. “I  have a simple and unoccupied mind—that may be why I sometimes hear  things that up to the present you have not been able to.”    Corpang darkened, and kept silent; and then Maskull saw through to his  pride.    The ledge presently began to rise. They were high above the platform on  the opposite side of the gulf. The road then curved sharply to the  right, and they passed over the abyss and the other ledge as by a  bridge, coming out upon the top of the opposite cliffs. A new line of  precipices immediately confronted them. They followed the drumming along  the base of these heights, but as they were passing the mouth of a large  cave the sound came from its recesses, and they turned their steps  inward.    “This leads to the outer world,” remarked Corpang. “I’ve occasionally  been there by this passage.”    “Then that’s where it is taking us, no doubt. I confess I shan’t be  sorry to see sunlight once more.”    “Can you find time to think of sunlight?” asked Corpang with a rough  smile.    “I love the sun, and perhaps I’m rather lacking in the spirit of a  zealot.”    “Yet, for all that, you may get there before me.”    “Don’t be bitter,” said Maskull. “I’ll tell you another thing. Muspel  can’t be willed, for the simple reason that Muspel does not concern the  will. To will is a property of this world.”    “Then what is your journey for?”    “It’s one thing to walk to a destination, and to linger over the walk,  and quite another to run there at top speed.”    “Perhaps I’m not so easily deceived as you think,” said Corpang with  another smile.    The light persisted in the cave. The path narrowed and became a steep  ascent. Then the angle became one of forty-five degrees, and they had to  climb. The tunnel grew so confined that Maskull was reminded of the  confined dreams of his childhood.    Not long afterward, daylight appeared. They hastened to complete the  last stage. Maskull rushed out first into the world of colours and, all  dirty and bleeding from numerous scratches, stood blinking on a  hillside, bathed in the brilliant late-afternoon sunshine. Corpang  followed closely at his heels. He was obliged to shield his eyes with  his hands for a few minutes, so unaccustomed was he to Branchspell’s  blinding rays.    “The drum beats have stopped!” he exclaimed suddenly.    “You can’t expect music all the time,” answered Maskull dryly. “We  mustn’t be luxurious.”    “But now we have no guide. We’re no better off than before.”    “Well, Tormance is a big place. But I have an infallible rule, Corpang.  As I come from the south, I always go due north.”    “That will take us to Lichstorm.”    Maskull gazed at the fantastically piled rocks all around them. “I saw  these rocks from Matterplay. The mountains look as far off now as they  did then, and there’s not much of the day left. How far is Lichstorm  from here?”    Corpang looked away to the distant range. “I don’t know, but unless a  miracle happens we shan’t get there tonight.”    “I have a feeling,” said Maskull, “that we shall not only get there  tonight, but that tonight will be the most important in my life.”    And he sat down passively to rest.        Chapter 18. HAUNTE    While Maskull sat, Corpang walked restlessly to and fro, swinging his  arms. He had lost his staff. His face was inflamed with suppressed  impatience, which accentuated its natural coarseness. At last he stopped  short in front of Maskull and looked down at him. “What do you intend to  do?”    Maskull glanced up and idly waved his hand toward the distant mountains.  “Since we can’t walk, we must wait.”    “For what?”    “I don’t know... How’s this, though? Those peaks have changed colour,  from red to green.”    “Yes, the lich wind is travelling this way.”    “The lich wind?”    “It’s the atmosphere of Lichstorm. It always clings to the mountains,  but when the wind blows from the north it comes as far as Threal.”    “It’s a sort of fog, then?”    “A peculiar sort, for they say it excites the sexual passions.”    “So we are to have lovemaking,” said Maskull, laughing.    “Perhaps you won’t find it so joyous,” replied Corpang a little grimly.    “But tell me—these peaks, how do they preserve their balance?”    Corpang gazed at the distant, overhanging summits, which were fast  fading into obscurity.    “Passion keeps them from falling.”    Maskull laughed again; he was feeling a strange disturbance of spirit.  “What, the love of rock for rock?”    “It is comical, but true.”    “We’ll take a closer peep at them presently. Beyond the mountains is  Barey, is it not?”    “Yes.”    “And then the Ocean. But what is the name of that Ocean?”    “That is told only to those who die beside it.”    “Is the secret so precious, Corpang?”    Branchspell was nearing the horizon in the west; there were more than  two hours of daylight remaining. The air all around them became murky.  It was a thin mist, neither damp nor cold. The Lichstorm Range now  appeared only as a blur on the sky. The air was electric and tingling,  and was exciting in its effect. Maskull felt a sort of emotional  inflammation, as though a very slight external cause would serve to  overturn his self-control. Corpang stood silent with a mouth like iron.    Maskull kept looking toward a high pile of rocks in the vicinity.    “That seems to me a good watchtower. Perhaps we shall see something from  the top.”    Without waiting for his companion’s opinion, he began to scramble up the  tor, and in a few minutes was standing on the summit. Corpang joined  him.    From their viewpoint they saw the whole countryside sloping down to the  sea, which appeared as a mere flash of far-off, glittering water.  Leaving all that, however, Maskull’s eyes immediately fastened  themselves on a small, boat-shaped object, about two miles away, which  was travelling rapidly toward them, suspended only a few feet in the  air.    “What do you make of that?” he asked in a tone of astonishment.    Corpang shook his head and said nothing.    Within two minutes the flying object, whatever it was, had diminished  the distance between them by one half. It resembled a boat more and  more, but its flight was erratic, rather than smooth; its nose was  continually jerking upward and downward, and from side to side. Maskull  now made out a man sitting in the stern, and what looked like a large  dead animal lying amidships. As the aerial craft drew nearer, he  observed a thick, blue haze underneath it, and a similar haze behind,  but the front, facing them, was clear.    “Here must be what we are waiting for, Corpang. But what on earth  carries it?”    He stroked his beard contemplatively, and then, fearing that they had  not been seen, stepped onto the highest rock, bellowed loudly, and made  wild motions with his arm. The flying-boat, which was only a few hundred  yards distant, slightly altered its course, now heading toward them in a  way that left no doubt that the steersman had detected their presence.    The boat slackened speed until it was travelling no faster than a  walking man, but the irregularity of its movements continued. It was  shaped rather queerly. About twenty feet long, its straight sides  tapered off from a flat bow, four feet broad, to a sharp-angled stern.  The flat bottom was not above ten feet from the ground. It was undecked,  and carried only one living occupant; the other object they had  distinguished was really the carcass of an animal, of about the size of  a large sheep. The blue haze trailing behind the boat appeared to  emanate from the glittering point of a short upright pole fastened in  the stern. When the craft was within a few feet of them, and they were  looking down at it in wonder from above, the man removed this pole and  covered the brightly shining tip with a cap. The forward motion then  ceased altogether, and the boat began to drift hither and thither, but  still it remained suspended in the air, while the haze underneath  persisted. Finally the broad side came gently up against the pile of  rocks on which they were standing. The steersman jumped ashore and  immediately clambered up to meet them.    Maskull offered him a hand, but he refused it disdainfully. He was a  young man, of middle height. He wore a close-fitting fur garment. His  limbs were quite ordinary, but his trunk was disproportionately long,  and he had the biggest and deepest chest that Maskull had ever seen in a  man. His hairless face was sharp, pointed, and ugly, with protruding  teeth, and a spiteful, grinning expression. His eyes and brows sloped  upward. On his forehead was an organ which looked as though it had been  mutilated—it was a mere disagreeable stump of flesh. His hair was short  and thin. Maskull could not name the colour of his skin, but it seemed  to stand in the same relation to jale as green to red.    Once up, the stranger stood for a minute or two, scrutinising the two  companions through half-closed lids, all the time smiling insolently.  Maskull was all eagerness to exchange words, but did not care to be the  first to speak. Corpang stood moodily, a little in the background.    “What men are you?” demanded the aerial navigator at last. His voice was  extremely loud, and possessed a most unpleasant timbre. It sounded to  Maskull like a large volume of air trying to force its way through a  narrow orifice.    “I am Maskull; my friend is Corpang. He comes from Threal, but where I  come from, don’t ask.”    “I am Haunte, from Sarclash.”    “Where may that be?”    “Half an hour ago I could have shown it to you, but now it has got too  murky. It is a mountain in Lichstorm.”    “Are you returning there now?”    “Yes.”    “And how long will it take to get there in that boat?”    “Two—three hours.”    “Will it accommodate us too?”    “What, are you for Lichstorm as well? What can you want there?”    “To see the sights,” responded Maskull with twinkling eyes. “But first  of all, to dine. I can’t remember having eaten all day. You seem to have  been hunting to some purpose, so we won’t lack for food.”    Haunte eyed him quizzically. “You certainly don’t lack impudence.  However, I’m a man of that sort myself, and it is the sort I prefer.  Your friend, now, would probably rather starve than ask a meal of a  stranger. He looks to me just like a bewildered toad dragged up out of a  dark hole.”    Maskull took Corpang’s arm, and constrained him to silence.    “Where have you been hunting, Haunte?”    “Matterplay. I had the worst luck—I speared one wold horse, and there it  lies.”    “What is Lichstorm like?”    “There are men there, and there are women there, but there are no men-  women, as with you.”    “What do you call men-women?”    “Persons of mixed sex, like yourself. In Lichstorm the sexes are pure.”    “I have always regarded myself as a man.”    “Very likely you have; but the test is, do you hate and fear women?”    “Why, do you?”    Haunte grinned and showed his teeth. “Things are different in  Lichstorm.... So you want to see the sights?”    “I confess I am curious to see your women, for example, after what you  say.”    “Then I’ll introduce you to Sullenbode.”    He paused a moment after making this remark, and then suddenly uttered a  great, bass laugh, so that his chest shook.    “Let us share the joke,” said Maskull.    “Oh, you’ll understand it later.”    “If you play pranks with me, I won’t stand on ceremony with you.”    Haunte laughed again. “I won’t be the one to play pranks. Sullenbode  will be deeply obliged to me. If I don’t visit her myself as often as  she would like, I’m always glad to serve her in other ways.... Well, you  shall have your boat ride.”    Maskull rubbed his nose doubtfully. “If the sexes hate one another in  your land, is it because passion is weaker, or stronger?”    “In other parts of the world there is soft passion, but in Lichstorm  there is hard passion.”    “But what do you call hard passion?”    “Where men are called to women by pain, and not pleasure.”    “I intend to understand, before I’ve finished.”    “Yes,” answered Haunte, with a taunting look, “it would be a pity to let  the chance slip, since you’re going to Lichstorm.”    It was now Corpang’s turn to take Maskull by the arm. “This journey will  end badly.”    “Why so?”    “Your goal was Muspel a short while ago; now it is women.”    “Let me alone,” said Maskull. “Give luck a slack rein. What brought this  boat here?”    “What is this talk about Muspel?” demanded Haunte.    Corpang caught his shoulder roughly, and stared straight into his eyes.  “What do you know?”    “Not much, but something, perhaps. Ask me at supper. Now it is high time  to start. Navigating the mountains by night isn’t child’s play, let me  tell you.”    “I shall not forget,” said Corpang.    Maskull gazed down at the boat. “Are we to get in?”    “Gently, my friend. It’s only canework and skin.”    “First of all, you might enlighten me as to how you have contrived to  dispense with the laws of gravitation.”    Haunte smiled sarcastically. “A secret in your ear, Maskull. All laws  are female. A true male is an outlaw—outside the law.”    “I don’t understand.”    “The great body of the earth is continually giving out female particles,  and the male parts of rocks and living bodies are equally continually  trying to reach them. That’s gravitation.”    “Then how do you manage with your boat?”    “My two male stones do the work. The one underneath the boat prevents it  from falling to the ground; the one in the stern shuts it off from solid  objects in the rear. The only part of the boat attracted by any part of  the earth is the bow, for that’s the only part the light of the male  stones does not fall on. So in that direction the boat travels.”    “And what are these wondrous male stones?”    “They really are male stones. There is nothing female in them; they are  showering out male sparks all the time. These sparks devour all the  female particles rising from the earth. No female particles are left  over to attract the male parts of the boat, and so they are not in the  least attracted in that direction.”    Maskull ruminated for a minute.    “With your hunting, and boatbuilding, and science, you seem a very  handy, skilful fellow, Haunte.... But the sun’s sinking, and we’d better  start.”    “Get down first, then, and shift that carcass farther forward. Then you  and your gloomy friend can sit amidships.”    Maskull immediately climbed down, and dropped himself into the boat; but  then he received a surprise. The moment he stood on the frail bottom,  still clinging to the rock, not only did his weight entirely disappear,  as though he were floating in some heavy medium, like salt water, but  the rock he held onto drew him, as by a mild current of electricity, and  he was able to withdraw his hands only with difficulty.    After the first moment’s shock, he quietly accepted the new order of  things, and set about shifting the carcass. Since there was no weight in  the boat this was effected without any great labour. Corpang then  descended. The astonishing physical change had no power to disturb his  settled composure, which was founded on moral ideas. Haunte came last;  grasping the staff which held the upper male stone, he proceeded to  erect it, after removing the cap. Maskull then obtained his first near  view of the mysterious light, which, by counteracting the forces of  Nature, acted indirectly not only as elevator but as motive force. In  the last ruddy gleams of the great sun, its rays were obscured, and it  looked little more impressive than an extremely brilliant, scintillating  blue-white jewel, but its power could be gauged by the visible, coloured  mist that it threw out for many yards around.    The steering was effected by means of a shutter attached by a cord to  the top of the staff, which could be so manipulated that any segment of  the male stone’s rays, or all the rays, or none at all, could be shut  off at will. No sooner was the staff raised than the aerial vessel  quietly detached itself from the rock to which it had been drawn, and  passed slowly forward in the direction of the mountains. Branchspell  sank below the horizon. The gathering mist blotted out everything  outside a radius of a few miles. The air grew cool and fresh.    Soon the rock masses ceased on the great, rising plain. Haunte withdrew  the shutter entirely, and the boat gathered full speed.    “You say that navigation among the mountains is difficult at night,”  exclaimed Maskull. “I would have thought it impossible.”    Haunte grunted. “You will have to take risks, and think yourself  fortunate if you come off with nothing worse than a cracked skull. But  one thing I can tell you—if you go on disturbing me with your chitchat  we shan’t get as far as the mountains.”    Thereafter Maskull was silent.    The twilight deepened; the murk grew denser. There was little to look  at, but much to feel. The motion of the boat, which was due to the  never-ending struggle between the male stones and the force of  gravitation, resembled in an exaggerated fashion the violent tossing of  a small craft on a choppy sea. The two passengers became unhappy.  Haunte, from his seat in the stern, gazed at them sardonically with one  eye. The darkness now came on rapidly.    About ninety minutes after the commencement of the voyage they arrived  at the foothills of Lichstorm. They began to mount. There was no  daylight left to see by. Beneath them, however, on both sides of them  and in the rear, the landscape was lighted up for a considerable  distance by the now vivid blue rays of the twin male stones. Ahead,  where these rays did not shine, Haunte was guided by the self-luminous  nature of the rocks, grass, and trees. These were faintly  phosphorescent; the vegetation shone out more strongly than the soil.    The moon was not shining and there were no stars; Maskull therefore  inferred that the upper atmosphere was dense with mist. Once or twice,  from his sensations of choking, he thought that they were entering a  fogbank, but it was a strange kind of fog, for it had the effect of  doubling the intensity of every light in front of them. Whenever this  happened, nightmare feelings attacked him; he experienced transitory,  unreasoning fright and horror.    Now they passed high above the valley that separated the foothills from  the mountains themselves. The boat began an ascent of many thousands of  feet and, as the cliffs were near, Haunte had to manoeuvre carefully  with the rear light in order to keep clear of them. Maskull watched the  delicacy of his movements, not without admiration. A long time went by.  It grew much colder; the air was damp and drafty. The fog began to  deposit something like snow on their persons. Maskull kept sweating with  terror, not because of the danger they were in, but because of the cloud  banks that continued to envelop them.    They cleared the first line of precipices. Still mounting, but this time  with a forward motion, as could be seen by the vapours illuminated by  the male stones through which they passed, they were soon altogether out  of sight of solid ground. Suddenly and quite unexpectedly the moon broke  through. In the upper atmosphere thick masses of fog were seen crawling  hither and thither, broken in many places by thin rifts of sky, through  one of which Teargeld was shining. Below them, to their left, a gigantic  peak, glittering with green ice, showed itself for a few seconds, and  was then swallowed up again. All the rest of the world was hidden by the  mist. The moon went in again. Maskull had seen quite enough to make him  long for the aerial voyage to end.    The light from the male stones presently illuminated the face of a new  cliff. It was grand, rugged, and perpendicular. Upward, downward, and on  both sides, it faded imperceptibly into the night. After coasting it a  little way, they observed a shelf of rock jutting out. It was square,  measuring about a dozen feet each way. Green snow covered it to a depth  of some inches. Immediately behind it was a dark slit in the rock, which  promised to be the mouth of a cave.    Haunte skilfully landed the boat on this platform. Standing up, he  raised the staff bearing the keel light and lowered the other; then  removed both male stones, which he continued to hold in his hand. His  face was thrown into strong relief by the vivid, sparkling blue-white  rays. It looked rather surly.    “Do we get out?” inquired Maskull.    “Yes. I live here.”    “Thanks for the successful end of a dangerous journey.”    “Yes, it has been touch-and-go.”    Corpang jumped onto the platform. He was smiling coarsely. “There has  been no danger, for our destinies lie elsewhere. You are merely a  ferryman, Haunte.”    “Is that so?” returned Haunte, with a most unpleasant laugh. “I thought  I was carrying men, not gods.”    “Where are we?” asked Maskull. As he spoke, he got out, but Haunte  remained standing a minute in the boat.    “This is Sarclash—the second highest mountain in the land.”    “Which is the highest, then?”    “Adage. Between Sarclash and Adage there is a long ridge—very difficult  in places. About halfway along the ridge, at the lowest point, lies the  top of the Mornstab Pass, which goes through to Barey. Now you know the  lay of the land.”    “Does the woman Sullenbode live near here?”    “Near enough.” Haunte grinned.    He leaped out of the boat and, pushing past the others without ceremony,  walked straight into the cave.    Maskull followed, with Corpang at his heels. A few stone steps led to a  doorway, curtained by the skin of some large beast. Their host pushed  his way in, never offering to hold the skin aside for them. Maskull made  no comment, but grabbed it with his fist and tugged it away from its  fastenings to the ground. Haunte looked at the skin, and then stared  hard at Maskull with his disagreeable smile, but neither said anything.    The place in which they found themselves was a large oblong cavern, with  walls, floor, and ceiling of natural rock. There were two doorways: that  by which they had entered, and another of smaller size directly  opposite. The cave was cold and cheerless; a damp draft passed from door  to door. Many skins of wild animals lay scattered on the ground. A  number of lumps of sun-dried flesh were hanging on a string along the  wall, and a few bulging liquor skins reposed in a corner. There were  tusks, horns, and bones everywhere. Resting against the wall were two  short hunting spears, having beautiful crystal heads.    Haunte set down the two male stones on the ground, near the farther  door; thire light illuminated the whole cave. He then walked over to the  meat and, snatching a large piece, began to gnaw it ravenously.    “Are we invited to the feast?” asked Maskull.    Haunte pointed to the hanging flesh and to the liquor skins, but did not  pause in his chewing.    “Where’s a cup?” inquired Maskull, lifting one of the skins.    Haunte indicated a clay goblet lying on the floor. Maskull picked it up,  undid the neck of the skin, and, resting it under his arm, filled the  cup. Tasting the liquor, he discovered it to be raw spirit. He tossed  off the draught, and then felt much better.    The second cupful he proffered to Corpang. The latter took a single sip,  swallowed it, and then passed the cup back without a word. He refused to  drink again, as long as they were in the cave. Maskull finished the cup,  and began to throw off care.    Going to the meat line, he took down a large double handful, and sat  down on a pile of skins to eat at his ease. The flesh was tough and  coarse, but he had never tasted anything sweeter. He could not  understand the flavour, which was not surprising in a world of strange  animals. The meal proceeded in silence. Corpang ate sparingly, standing  up, and afterward lay down on a bundle of furs. His bold eyes watched  all the movements of the other two. Haunte had not drunk as yet.    At last Maskull concluded his meal. He emptied another cup, sighed  pleasantly, and prepared to talk.    “Now explain further about your women, Haunte.”    Haunte fetched another skin of liquor and a second cup. He tore off the  string with his teeth, and poured out and drank cup after cup in quick  succession. Then he sat down, crossed his legs, and turned to Maskull.    “Well?”    “So they are objectionable?”    “They are deadly.”    “Deadly? In what way can they possibly be deadly?”    “You will learn. I was watching you in the boat, Maskull. You had some  bad feelings, eh?”    “I don’t conceal it. There were times when I felt as if I were  struggling with a nightmare. What caused it?”    “The female atmosphere of Lichstorm. Sexual passion.”    “I had no passion.”    “That was passion—the first stage. Nature tickles your people into  marriage, but it tortures us. Wait till you get outside. You’ll have a  return of those sensations—only ten times worse. The drink you’ve had  will see to that.... How do you suppose it will all end?”    “If I knew, I wouldn’t be asking you questions.”    Haunte laughed loudly. “Sullenbode.”    “You mean it will end in my seeking Sullenbode?”    “But what will come of it, Maskull? What will she give you? Sweet,  fainting, white-armed, feminine voluptuousness?”    Maskull coolly drank another cup. “And why should she give all that to a  passerby?”    “Well, as a matter of fact, she hasn’t it to give. No, what she will  give you, and what you’ll accept from her, because you can’t help it,  is—anguish, insanity, possibly death.”    “You may be talking sense, but it sounds like raving to me. Why should I  accept insanity and death?”    “Because your passion will force you to.”    “What about yourself?” Maskull asked, biting his nails.    “Oh, I have my male stones. I am immune.”    “Is that all that prevents you from being like other men?”    “Yes, but don’t attempt any tricks, Maskull.”    Maskull went on drinking steadily, and said nothing for a time. “So men  and women here are hostile to each other, and love is unknown?” he  proceeded at last.    “That magic word.... Shall I tell you what love is, Maskull? Love  between male and female is impossible. When Maskull loves a woman, it is  Maskull’s female ancestors who are loving her. But here in this land the  men are pure males. They have drawn nothing from the female side.”    “Where do the male stones come from?”    “Oh, they are not freaks. There must be whole beds of the stuff  somewhere. It is all that prevents the world from being a pure female  world. It would be one big mass of heavy sweetness, without individual  shapes.”    “Yet this same sweetness is torturing to men?”    “The life of an absolute male is fierce. An excess of life is dangerous  to the body. How can it be anything else than torturing?”    Corpang now sat up suddenly, and addressed Haunte. “I remind you of your  promise to tell about Muspel.”    Haunte regarded him with a malevolent smile. “Ha! The underground man  has come to life.”    “Yes, tell us,” put in Maskull carelessly.    Haunte drank, and laughed a little. “Well, the tale’s short, and hardly  worth telling, but since you’re interested.... A stranger came here five  years ago, inquiring after Muspel-light. His name was Lodd. He came from  the east. He came up to me one bright morning in summer, outside this  very cave. If you ask me to describe him—I can’t imagine a second man  like him. He looked so proud, noble, superior, that I felt my own blood  to be dirty by comparison. You can guess I don’t have this feeling for  everyone. Now that I am recalling him, he was not so much superior as  different. I was so impressed that I rose and talked to him standing. He  inquired the direction of the mountain Adage. He went on to say, ‘They  say Muspel-light is sometimes seen there. What do you know of such a  thing?’ I told him the truth—that I knew nothing about it, and then he  went on, ‘Well, I am going to Adage. And tell those who come after me on  the same errand that they had better do the same thing.’ That was the  whole conversation. He started on his way, and I’ve never seen him or  heard of him since.”    “So you didn’t have the curiosity to follow him?”    “No, because the moment he had turned his back all my interest in the  man somehow seemed to vanish.”    “Probably because he was useless to you.”    Corpang glanced at Maskull. “Our road is marked out for us.”    “So it would appear,” said Maskull indifferently.    The talk flagged for a time. Maskull felt the silence oppressive, and  grew restless.    “What do you call the colour of your skin, Haunte, as I saw it in  daylight? It struck me as strange.”    “Dolm,” said Haunte.    “A compound of ulfire and blue,” explained Corpang.    “Now I know. These colours are puzzling for a stranger.”    “What colours have you in your world?” asked Corpang.    “Only three primary ones, but here you seem to have five, though how it  comes about I can’t imagine.”    “There are two sets of three primary colours here,” said Corpang, “but  as one of the colours—blue—is identical in both sets, altogether there  are five primary colours.”    “Why two sets?”    “Produced by the two suns. Branchspell produces blue, yellow, and red;  Alppain, ulfire, blue, and jale.”    “It’s remarkable that explanation has never occurred to me before.”    “So here you have another illustration of the necessary trinity of  nature. Blue is existence. It is darkness seen through light; a  contrasting of existence and nothingness. Yellow is relation. In yellow  light we see the relation of objects in the clearest way. Red is  feeling. When we see red, we are thrown back on our personal  feelings.... As regards the Alppain colours, blue stands in the middle  and is therefore not existence, but relation. Ulfire is existence; so it  must be a different sort of existence.”    Haunte yawned. “There are marvellous philosophers in your underground  hole.”    Maskull got up and looked about him.    “Where does that other door lead to?”    “Better explore,” said Haunte.    Maskull took him at his word, and strolled across the cave, flinging the  curtain aside and disappearing into the night. Haunte rose abruptly and  hurried after him.    Corpang too got to his feet. He went over to the untouched spirit skins,  untied the necks, and allowed the contents to gush out on to the floor.  Next he took the hunting spears, and snapped off the points between his  hands. Before he had time to resume his seat, Haunte and Maskull  reappeared. The host’s quick, shifty eyes at once took in what had  happened. He smiled, and turned pale.    “You haven’t been idle, friend.”    Corpang fixed Haunte with his bold, heavy gaze. “I thought it well to  draw your teeth.”    Maskull burst out laughing. “The toad’s come into the light to some  purpose, Haunte. Who would have expected it?”    Haunte, after staring hard at Corpang for two or three minutes, suddenly  uttered a strange cry, like an evil spirit, and flung himself upon him.  The two men began to wrestle like wildcats. They were as often on the  floor as on their legs, and Maskull could not see who was getting the  better of it. He made no attempt to separate them. A thought came into  his head and, snatching up the two male stones, he ran with them,  laughing, through the upper doorway, into the open night air.    The door overlooked an abyss on another face of the mountain. A narrow  ledge, sprinkled with green snow, wound along the cliff to the right; it  was the only available path. He pitched the pebbles over the edge of the  chasm. Although hard and heavy in his hand, they sank more like feathers  than stones, and left a long trail of vapour behind. While Maskull was  still watching them disappear, Haunte came rushing out of the cavern,  followed by Corpang. He gripped Maskull’s arm excitedly.    “What in Krag’s name have you done?”    “Overboard they have gone,” replied Maskull, renewing his laughter.    “You accursed madman!”    Haunte’s luminous colour came and went, just as though his internal  light were breathing. Then he grew suddenly calm, by a supreme exertion  of his will.    “You know this kills me?”    “Haven’t you been doing your best this last hour to make me ripe for  Sullenbode? Well then, cheer up, and join the pleasure party!”    “You say it as a joke, but it is the miserable truth.”    Haunte’s jeering malevolence had completely vanished. He looked a sick  man—yet somehow his face had become nobler.    “I would be very sorry for you, Haunte, if it did not entail my being  also very sorry for myself. We are now all three together on the same  errand—which doesn’t appear to have struck you yet.”    “But why this errand at all?” asked Corpang quietly. “Can’t you men  exercise self-control till you have arrived out of danger?”    Haunte fixed him with wild eyes. “No. The phantoms come trooping in on  me already.”    He sat down moodily, but the next minute was up again.    “And I cannot wait.... the game is started.”    Soon afterward, by silent consent, they began to walk the ledge, Haunte  in front. It was narrow, ascending, and slippery, so that extreme  caution was demanded. The way was lighted by the self-luminous snow and  rocks.    When they had covered about half a mile, Maskull, who went second of the  party, staggered, caught the cliff, and finally sat down.    “The drink works. My old sensations are returning, but worse.”    Haunte turned back. “Then you are a doomed man.”    Maskull, though fully conscious of his companions and situation,  imagined that he was being oppressed by a black, shapeless, supernatural  being, who was trying to clasp him. He was filled with horror, trembled  violently, yet could not move a limb. Sweat tumbled off his face in  great drops. The waking nightmare lasted a long time, but during that  space it kept coming and going. At one moment the vision seemed on the  point of departing; the next it almost took shape—which he knew would be  his death. Suddenly it vanished altogether—he was free. A fresh spring  breeze fanned his face; he heard the slow, solitary singing of a sweet  bird; and it seemed to him as if a poem had shot together in his soul.  Such flashing, heartbreaking joy he had never experienced before in all  his life! Almost immediately that too vanished.    Sitting up, he passed his hand across his eyes and swayed quietly, like  one who has been visited by an angel.    “Your colour changed to white,” said Corpang. “What happened?”    “I passed through torture to love,” replied Maskull simply.    He stood up. Haunte gazed at him sombrely. “Will you not describe that  passage?”    Maskull answered slowly and thoughtfully. “When I was in Matterplay, I  saw heavy clouds discharge themselves and change to coloured, living  animals. In the same way, my black, chaotic pangs just now seemed to  consolidate themselves and spring together as a new sort of joy. The joy  would not have been possible without the preliminary nightmare. It is  not accidental; Nature intends it so. The truth has just flashed through  my brain.... You men of Lichstorm don’t go far enough. You stop at the  pangs, without realising that they are birth pangs.”    “If this is true, you are a great pioneer,” muttered Haunte.    “How does this sensation differ from common love?” interrogated Corpang.    “This was all that love is, multiplied by wildness.”    Corpang fingered his chin awhile. “The Lichstorm men, however, will  never reach this stage, for they are too masculine.”    Haunte turned pale. “Why should we alone suffer?”    “Nature is freakish and cruel, and doesn’t act according to justice....  Follow us, Haunte, and escape from it all.”    “I’ll see,” muttered Haunte. “Perhaps I will.”    “Have we far to go, to Sullenbode?” inquired Maskull.    “No, her home’s under the hanging cap of Sarclash.”    “What is to happen tonight?” Maskull spoke to himself, but Haunte  answered him.    “Don’t expect anything pleasant, in spite of what has just occurred. She  is not a woman, but a mass of pure sex. Your passion will draw her out  into human shape, but only for a moment. If the change were permanent,  you would have endowed her with a soul.”    “Perhaps the change might be made permanent.”    “To do that, it is not enough to desire her; she must desire you as  well. But why should she desire you?”    “Nothing turns out as one expects,” said Maskull, shaking his head. “We  had better get on again.”    They resumed the journey. The ledge still rose, but, on turning a corner  of the cliff, Haunte quitted it and began to climb a steep gully, which  mounted directly to the upper heights. Here they were compelled to use  both hands and feet. Maskull thought all the while of nothing but the  overwhelming sweetness he had just experienced.    The flat ground on top was dry and springy. There was no more snow, and  bright plants appeared. Haunte turned sharply to the left.    “This must be under the cap,” said Maskull.    “It is; and within five minutes you will see Sullenbode.”    When he spoke his words, Maskull’s lips surprised him by their tender  sensitiveness. Their action against each other sent thrills throughout  his body.    The grass shone dimly. A huge tree, with glowing branches, came into  sight. It bore a multitude of red fruit, like hanging lanterns, but no  leaves. Underneath this tree Sullenbode was sitting. Her beautiful  light—a mingling of jale and white—gleamed softly through the darkness.  She sat erect, on crossed legs, asleep. She was clothed in a singular  skin garment, which started as a cloak thrown over one shoulder, and  ended as loose breeches terminating above the knees. Her forearms were  lightly folded, and in one hand she held a half-eaten fruit.    Maskull stood over her and looked down, deeply interested. He thought he  had never seen anything half so feminine. Her flesh was almost melting  in its softness. So undeveloped were the facial organs that they looked  scarcely human; only the lips were full, pouting, and expressive. In  their richness, these lips seemed like a splash of vivid will on a  background of slumbering protoplasm. Her hair was undressed. Its colour  could not be distinguished. It was long and tangled, and had been tucked  into her garment behind, for convenience.    Corpang looked calm and sullen, but both the others were visibly  agitated. Maskull’s heart was hammering away under his chest. Haunte  pulled him, and said, “My head feels as if it were being torn from my  shoulders.”    “What can that mean?”    “Yet there’s a horrible joy in it,” added Haunte, with a sickly smile.    He put his hand on the woman’s shoulder. She awoke softly, glanced up at  them, smiled, and then resumed eating her fruit. Maskull did not imagine  that she had intelligence enough to speak. Haunte suddenly dropped on  his knees, and kissed her lips.    She did not repulse him. During the continuance of the kiss, Maskull  noticed with a shock that her face was altering. The features emerged  from their indistinctness and became human, and almost powerful. The  smile faded, a scowl took its place. She thrust Haunte away, rose to her  feet, and stared beneath bent brows at the three men, each one in turn.  Maskull came last; his face she studied for quite a long time, but  nothing indicated what she thought.    Meanwhile Haunte again approached her, staggering and grinning. She  suffered him quietly; but the instant lips met lips the second time, he  fell backward with a startled cry, as though he had come in contact with  an electric wire. The back of his head struck the ground, and he lay  there motionless.    Corpang sprang forward to his assistance. But, when he saw what had  happened, he left him where he was.    “Maskull, come here quickly!”    The light was perceptibly fading from Haunte’s skin, as Maskull bent  over. The man was dead. His face was unrecognisable. The head had been  split from the top downward into two halves, streaming with strange-  coloured blood, as though it had received a terrible blow from an axe.    “This couldn’t be from the fall,” said Maskull.    “No, Sullenbode did it.”    Maskull turned quickly to look at the woman. She had resumed her former  attitude on the ground. The momentary intelligence had vanished from her  face, and she was again smiling.        Chapter 19. SULLENBODE    Sullenbode’s naked skin glowed softly through the darkness, but the  clothed part of her person was invisible. Maskull watched her senseless,  smiling face, and shivered. Strange feelings ran through his body.    Corpang spoke out of the night. “She looks like an evil spirit filled  with deadliness.”    “It was like deliberately kissing lightning.”    “Haunte was insane with passion.”    “So am I,” said Maskull quietly. “My body seems full of rocks, all  grinding against one another.”    “This is what I was afraid of.”    “It appears I shall have to kiss her too.”    Corpang pulled his arm. “Have you lost all manliness?”    But Maskull impatiently shook himself free. He plucked nervously at his  beard, and stared at Sullenbode. His lips kept twitching. After this had  gone on for a few minutes, he stepped forward, bent over the woman, and  lifted her bodily in his arms. Setting her upright against the rugged  tree trunk, he kissed her.    A cold, knifelike shock passed down his frame. He thought that it was  death, and lost consciousness.    When his sense returned, Sullenbode was holding him by the shoulder with  one hand at arm’s length, searching his face with gloomy eyes. At first  he failed to recognise her; it was not the woman he had kissed, but  another. Then he gradually realised that her face was identical with  that which Haunte’s action had called into existence. A great calmness  came upon him; his bad sensations had disappeared.    Sullenbode was transformed into a living soul. Her skin was firm, her  features were strong, her eyes gleamed with the consciousness of power.  She was tall and slight, but slow in all her gestures and movements. Her  face was not beautiful. It was long, and palely lighted, while the mouth  crossed the lower half like a gash of fire. The lips were as voluptuous  as before. Her brows were heavy. There was nothing vulgar in her—she  looked the kingliest of all women. She appeared not more than twenty-  five.    Growing tired, apparently, of his scrutiny, she pushed him a little way  and allowed her arm to drop, at the same time curving her mouth into a  long, bowlike smile. “Whom have I to thank for this gift of life?”    Her voice was rich, slow, and odd. Maskull felt himself in a dream.    “My name is Maskull.”    She motioned to him to come a step nearer. “Listen, Maskull. Man after  man has drawn me into the world, but they could not keep me there, for I  did not wish it. But now you have drawn me into it for all time, for  good or evil.”    Maskull stretched a hand toward the now invisible corpse, and said  quietly, “What have you to say about him?”    “Who was it?”    “Haunte.”    “So that was Haunte. The news will travel far and wide. He was a famous  man.”    “It’s a horrible affair. I can’t think that you killed him  deliberately.”    “We women are endowed with terrible power, but it is our only  protection. We do not want these visits; we loathe them.”    “I might have died, too.”    “You came together?”    “There were three of us. Corpang still stands over there.”    “I see a faintly glimmering form. What do you want of me, Corpang?”    “Nothing.”    “Then go away, and leave me with Maskull.”    “No need, Corpang. I am coming with you.”    “This is not that pleasure, then?” demanded the low, earnest voice, out  of the darkness.    “No, that pleasure has not returned.”    Sullenbode gripped his arm hard. “What pleasure are you speaking of?”    “A presentiment of love, which I felt not long ago.”    “But what do you feel now?”    “Calm and free.”    Sullenbode’s face seemed like a pallid mask, hiding a slow, swelling sea  of elemental passions. “I do not know how it will end, Maskull, but we  will still keep together a little. Where are you going?”    “To Adage,” said Corpang, stepping forward.    “But why?”    “We are following the steps of Lodd, who went there years ago, to find  Muspel-light.”    “What light is that?”    “It’s the light of another world.”    “The quest is grand. But cannot women see that light?”    “On one condition,” said Corpang. “They must forget their sex. Womanhood  and love belong to life, while Muspel is above life.”    “I give you all other men,” said Sullenbode. “Maskull is mine.”    “No. I am not here to help Maskull to a lover but to remind him of the  existence of nobler things.”    “You are a good man. But you two alone will never strike the road to  Adage.”    “Are you acquainted with it?”    Again the woman gripped Maskull’s arm. “What is love—which Corpang  despises?”    Maskull looked at her attentively. Sullenbode went on, “Love is that  which is perfectly willing to disappear and become nothing, for the sake  of the beloved.”    Corpang wrinkled his forehead. “A magnanimous female lover is new in my  experience.”    Maskull put him aside with his hand, and said to Sullenbode, “Are you  contemplating a sacrifice?”    She gazed at her feet, and smiled. “What does it matter what my thoughts  are? Tell me, are you starting at once, or do you mean to rest first?  It’s a rough road to Adage.”    “What’s in your mind?” demanded Maskull.    “I will guide you a little. When we reach the ridge between Sarclash and  Adage, perhaps I shall turn back.”    “And then?”    “Then if the moon shines perhaps you will arrive before daybreak, but if  it is dark it’s hardly likely.”    “That’s not what I meant. What will become of you after we have parted  company?”    “I shall return somewhere—perhaps here.”    Maskull went close up to her, in order to study her face better. “Shall  you sink back into—the old state?”    “No, Maskull, thank heaven.”    “Then how will you live?”    Sullenbode calmly removed the hand which he had placed on her arm. There  was a sort of swirling flame in her eyes. “And who said I would go on  living?”    Maskull blinked at her in bewilderment. A few moments passed before he  spoke again. “You women are a sacrificing lot. You know I can’t leave  you like this.”    Their eyes met. Neither withdrew them, and neither felt embarrassed.    “You will always be the most generous of men, Maskull. Now let us go....  Corpang is a single-minded personage, and the least we others—who aren’t  so single-minded—can do is to help him to his destination. We mustn’t  inquire whether the destination of single-minded men is as a rule worth  arriving at.”    “If it is good for Maskull, it will be good for me.”    “Well, no vessel can hold more than its appointed measure.”    Corpang gave a wry smile. “During your long sleep you appear to have  picked up wisdom.”    “Yes, Corpang, I have met many men, and explored many minds.”    As they moved off, Maskull remembered Haunte.    “Can we not bury that poor fellow?”    “By this time tomorrow we shall need burial ourselves. But I do not  include Corpang.”    “We have no tools, so you must have your way. You killed him, but I am  the real murderer. I stole his protecting light.”    “Surely that death is balanced by the life you have given me.” They left  the spot in the direction opposite to that by which the three men had  arrived. After a few steps, they came to green snow again. At the same  time the flat ground ended, and they started to traverse a steep,  pathless mountain slope. The snow and rocks glimmered, their own bodies  shone; otherwise everything was dark. The mists swirled around them, but  Maskull had no more nightmares. The breeze was cold, pure, and steady.  They walked in file, Sullenbode leading; her movements were slow and  fascinating. Corpang came last. His stern eyes saw nothing ahead but an  alluring girl and a half-infatuated man.    For a long time they continued crossing the rough and rocky slope,  maintaining a slightly upward course. The angle was so steep that a  false step would have been fatal. The high ground was on their right.  After a while, the hillside on the left hand changed to level ground,  and they seemed to have joined another spur of the mountain. The  ascending slope on the right hand persisted for a few hundred yards  more. Then Sullenbode bore sharply to the left, and they found level  ground all around them.    “We are on the ridge,” announced the woman, halting.    The others came up to her, and at the same instant the moon burst  through the clouds, illuminating the whole scene.    Maskull uttered a cry. The wild, noble, lonely beauty of the view was  quite unexpected. Teargeld was high in the sky to their left, shining  down on them from behind. Straight in front, like an enormously wide,  smoothly descending road, lay the great ridge which went on to Adage,  though Adage itself was out of sight. It was never less than two hundred  yards wide. It was covered with green snow, in some places entirely, but  in other places the naked",54.36,10.5,11.9,8.94,13.1,5.94,2138,7.571428571428571,12.74,12th and 13th grade

21,Peter Pan in Kensington Gardensr,"all holding on to each other, and so forming  a dazzling canopy over the fairy ring. There were thousands of little  people looking on, but they were in shadow and drab in colour compared  to the glorious creatures within that luminous circle who were so  bewilderingly bright that Maimie had to wink hard all the time she  looked at them.    It was amazing and even irritating to her that the Duke of Christmas  Daisies should be able to keep out of love for a moment: yet out of love  his dusky grace still was: you could see it by the shamed looks of the  Queen and court (though they pretended not to care), by the way darling  ladies brought forward for his approval burst into tears as they were  told to pass on, and by his own most dreary face.    Maimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the Duke’s heart and  hear him give utterance to his parrot cry, and she was particularly  sorry for the Cupids, who stood in their fools’ caps in obscure  places and, every time they heard that “Cold, quite cold,” bowed their  disgraced little heads.    She was disappointed not to see Peter Pan, and I may as well tell you  now why he was so late that night. It was because his boat had got  wedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice, through which  he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle.    The fairies had as yet scarcely missed him, for they could not dance, so  heavy were their hearts. They forget all the steps when they are sad  and remember them again when they are merry. David tells me that fairies  never say “We feel happy”: what they say is, “We feel _dancey_.”    Well, they were looking very undancy indeed, when sudden laughter broke  out among the onlookers, caused by Brownie, who had just arrived and was  insisting on her right to be presented to the Duke.    Maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared, though she  had really no hope; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie  herself who, however, was absolutely confident. She was led before his  grace, and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart,  which for convenience sake was reached by a little trap-door in his  diamond shirt, had begun to say mechanically, “Cold, qui--,” when he  stopped abruptly.    “What’s this?” he cried, and first he shook the heart like a watch, and  then put his ear to it.    “Bless my soul!” cried the doctor, and by this time of course the  excitement among the spectators was tremendous, fairies fainting right  and left.    Everybody stared breathlessly at the Duke, who was very much startled  and looked as if he would like to run away. “Good gracious me!” the  doctor was heard muttering, and now the heart was evidently on fire, for  he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth.    The suspense was awful!    Then in a loud voice, and bowing low, “My Lord Duke,” said the physician  elatedly, “I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace  is in love.”    You can’t conceive the effect of it. Brownie held out her arms to the  Duke and he flung himself into them, the Queen leapt into the arms of  the Lord Chamberlain, and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of  her gentlemen, for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything.  Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place, for if you  leap into each other’s arms it is a fairy wedding. Of course a clergyman  has to be present.    How the crowd cheered and leapt! Trumpets brayed, the moon came out, and  immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were  ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring.  Most gladsome sight of all, the Cupids plucked the hated fools’ caps  from their heads and cast them high in the air. And then Maimie went  and spoiled everything. She couldn’t help it. She was crazy with delight  over her little friend’s good fortune, so she took several steps forward  and cried in an ecstasy, “Oh, Brownie, how splendid!”    Everybody stood still, the music ceased, the lights went out, and all in  the time you may take to say “Oh dear!” An awful sense of her peril  came upon Maimie, too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a  place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the  gates, she heard the murmur of an angry multitude, she saw a thousand  swords flashing for her blood, and she uttered a cry of terror and fled.    How she ran! and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head.  Many times she lay down, and then quickly jumped up and ran on again.  Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew  she was in the Gardens. The one thing she was sure of was that she must  never cease to run, and she thought she was still running long after she  had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep. She thought the snowflakes  falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night. She thought  her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket, and tried to pull it over her  head. And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was  mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept.  But it was the fairies.    I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief  her. When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as “Slay  her!” “Turn her into something extremely unpleasant!” and so on, but the  pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front,  and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and  demand a boon.    Every bride has a right to a boon, and what she asked for was Maimie’s  life. “Anything except that,” replied Queen Mab sternly, and all the  fairies chanted “Anything except that.” But when they learned how Maimie  had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their  great glory and renown, they gave three huzzas for the little human, and  set off, like an army, to thank her, the court advancing in front  and the canopy keeping step with it. They traced Maimie easily by her  footprints in the snow.    But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs, it seemed impossible  to thank Maimie, for they could not waken her. They went through the  form of thanking her, that is to say, the new King stood on her body and  read her a long address of welcome, but she heard not a word of it. They  also cleared the snow off her, but soon she was covered again, and they  saw she was in danger of perishing of cold.    “Turn her into something that does not mind the cold,” seemed a good  suggestion of the doctor’s, but the only thing they could think of  that does not mind cold was a snowflake. “And it might melt,” the Queen  pointed out, so that idea had to be given up.    A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot, but  though there were so many of them she was too heavy. By this time all  the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs, but presently the Cupids  had a lovely idea. “Build a house round her,” they cried, and at once  everybody perceived that this was the thing to do; in a moment a hundred  fairy sawyers were among the branches, architects were running round  Maimie, measuring her; a bricklayer’s yard sprang up at her feet,  seventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation stone and the Queen  laid it, overseers were appointed to keep the boys off, scaffoldings  were run up, the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning  lathes, and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting  in the windows.    The house was exactly the size of Maimie and perfectly lovely. One of  her arms was extended and this had bothered them for a second, but they  built a verandah round it, leading to the front door. The windows were  the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller, but it  would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof. The fairies, as  is their custom, clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness,  and they were all so madly in love with the little house that they could  not bear to think they had finished it. So they gave it ever so many  little extra touches, and even then they added more extra touches.    For instance, two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney.    “Now we fear it is quite finished,” they sighed.    But no, for another two ran up the ladder, and tied some smoke to the  chimney.    “That certainly finishes it,” they cried reluctantly.    “Not at all,” cried a glow-worm, “if she were to wake without seeing a  night-light she might be frightened, so I shall be her night-light.”    “Wait one moment,” said a china merchant, “and I shall make you a  saucer.”    Now alas, it was absolutely finished.    Oh, dear no!    “Gracious me,” cried a brass manufacturer, “there’s no handle on the  door,” and he put one on.    An ironmonger added a scraper and an old lady ran up with a door-mat.  Carpenters arrived with a water-butt, and the painters insisted on  painting it.    Finished at last!    “Finished! how can it be finished,” the plumber demanded scornfully,  “before hot and cold are put in?” and he put in hot and cold. Then an  army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and  bulbs and forcing-houses, and soon they had a flower garden to the  right of the verandah and a vegetable garden to the left, and roses and  clematis on the walls of the house, and in less time than five minutes  all these dear things were in full bloom.    Oh, how beautiful the little house was now! But it was at last finished  true as true, and they had to leave it and return to the dance. They  all kissed their hands to it as they went away, and the last to go was  Brownie. She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream  down the chimney.    All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs  taking care of Maimie, and she never knew. She slept until the dream  was quite finished and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was  breaking from its egg, and then she almost fell asleep again, and then  she called out,    “Tony,” for she thought she was at home in the nursery. As Tony made no  answer, she sat up, whereupon her head hit the roof, and it opened like  the lid of a box, and to her bewilderment she saw all around her the  Kensington Gardens lying deep in snow. As she was not in the nursery she  wondered whether this was really herself, so she pinched her cheeks, and  then she knew it was herself, and this reminded her that she was in  the middle of a great adventure. She remembered now everything that had  happened to her from the closing of the gates up to her running away  from the fairies, but however, she asked herself, had she got into this  funny place? She stepped out by the roof, right over the garden, and  then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night. It so  entranced her that she could think of nothing else.    “Oh, you darling, oh, you sweet, oh, you love!” she cried.    Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house, or maybe it now knew  that its work was done, for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to  grow smaller; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it  was shrinking, yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now. It  always remained as complete as ever, but it became smaller and smaller,  and the garden dwindled at the same time, and the snow crept closer,  lapping house and garden up. Now the house was the size of a little  dog’s kennel, and now of a Noah’s Ark, but still you could see the smoke  and the door-handle and the roses on the wall, every one complete.  The glow-worm fight was waning too, but it was still there. “Darling,  loveliest, don’t go!” Maimie cried, falling on her knees, for the little  house was now the size of a reel of thread, but still quite complete.  But as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all  sides until it met itself, and where the little house had been was now  one unbroken expanse of snow.    Maimie stamped her foot naughtily, and was putting her fingers to her  eyes, when she heard a kind voice say, “Don’t cry, pretty human, don’t  cry,” and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy  regarding her wistfully. She knew at once that he must be Peter Pan.          Lock-out Time    It is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies, and almost  the only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever  there are children. Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens, and  at that time there was not a fairy in the place; then the children were  admitted, and the fairies came trooping in that very evening. They can’t  resist following the children, but you seldom see them, partly because  they live in the daytime behind the railings, where you are not allowed  to go, and also partly because they are so cunning. They are not a bit  cunning after Lock-out, but until Lock-out, my word!    When you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well, and you remember  a good deal about them in your babyhood, which it is a great pity you  can’t write down, for gradually you forget, and I have heard of children  who declared that they had never once seen a fairy. Very likely if they  said this in the Kensington Gardens, they were standing looking at a  fairy all the time. The reason they were cheated was that she pretended  to be something else. This is one of their best tricks. They usually  pretend to be flowers, because the court sits in the Fairies’ Basin,  and there are so many flowers there, and all along the Baby Walk, that  a flower is the thing least likely to attract attention. They dress  exactly like flowers, and change with the seasons, putting on white when  lilies are in and blue for blue-bells, and so on. They like crocus and  hyacinth time best of all, as they are partial to a bit of colour, but  tulips (except white ones, which are the fairy-cradles) they consider  garish, and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips for days, so  that the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time to catch  them.    When they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively, but  if you look and they fear there is no time to hide, they stand quite  still, pretending to be flowers. Then, after you have passed without  knowing that they were fairies, they rush home and tell their mothers  they have had such an adventure. The Fairy Basin, you remember, is all  covered with ground-ivy (from which they make their castor-oil), with  flowers growing in it here and there. Most of them really are flowers,  but some of them are fairies. You never can be sure of them, but a good  plan is to walk by looking the other way, and then turn round sharply.  Another good plan, which David and I sometimes follow, is to stare them  down. After a long time they can’t help winking, and then you know for  certain that they are fairies.    There are also numbers of them along the Baby Walk, which is a  famous gentle place, as spots frequented by fairies are called. Once  twenty-four of them had an extraordinary adventure. They were a girls’  school out for a walk with the governess, and all wearing hyacinth  gowns, when she suddenly put her finger to her mouth, and then they  all stood still on an empty bed and pretended to be hyacinths.  Unfortunately, what the governess had heard was two gardeners coming to  plant new flowers in that very bed. They were wheeling a handcart with  flowers in it, and were quite surprised to find the bed occupied. “Pity  to lift them hyacinths,” said the one man. “Duke’s orders,” replied the  other, and, having emptied the cart, they dug up the boarding-school and  put the poor, terrified things in it in five rows. Of course, neither  the governess nor the girls dare let on that they were fairies, so they  were carted far away to a potting-shed, out of which they escaped in the  night without their shoes, but there was a great row about it among the  parents, and the school was ruined.    As for their houses, it is no use looking for them, because they are  the exact opposite of our houses. You can see our houses by day but you  can’t see them by dark. Well, you can see their houses by dark, but you  can’t see them by day, for they are the colour of night, and I never  heard of anyone yet who could see night in the daytime. This does not  mean that they are black, for night has its colours just as day has,  but ever so much brighter. Their blues and reds and greens are like ours  with a light behind them. The palace is entirely built of many-coloured  glasses, and is quite the loveliest of all royal residences, but the  queen sometimes complains because the common people will peep in to see  what she is doing. They are very inquisitive folk, and press quite hard  against the glass, and that is why their noses are mostly snubby. The  streets are miles long and very twisty, and have paths on each side made  of bright worsted. The birds used to steal the worsted for their nests,  but a policeman has been appointed to hold on at the other end.    One of the great differences between the fairies and us is that they  never do anything useful. When the first baby laughed for the first  time, his laugh broke into a million pieces, and they all went skipping  about. That was the beginning of fairies. They look tremendously busy,  you know, as if they had not a moment to spare, but if you were to ask  them what they are doing, they could not tell you in the least. They are  frightfully ignorant, and everything they do is make-believe. They have  a postman, but he never calls except at Christmas with his little box,  and though they have beautiful schools, nothing is taught in them; the  youngest child being chief person is always elected mistress, and when  she has called the roll, they all go out for a walk and never come back.  It is a very noticeable thing that, in fairy families, the youngest  is always chief person, and usually becomes a prince or princess, and  children remember this, and think it must be so among humans also, and  that is why they are often made uneasy when they come upon their mother  furtively putting new frills on the basinette.    You have probably observed that your baby-sister wants to do all sorts  of things that your mother and her nurse want her not to do: to stand up  at sitting-down time, and to sit down at standing-up time, for instance,  or to wake up when she should fall asleep, or to crawl on the floor when  she is wearing her best frock, and so on, and perhaps you put this down  to naughtiness. But it is not; it simply means that she is doing as  she has seen the fairies do; she begins by following their ways, and  it takes about two years to get her into the human ways. Her fits of  passion, which are awful to behold, and are usually called teething,  are no such thing; they are her natural exasperation, because we don’t  understand her, though she is talking an intelligible language. She is  talking fairy. The reason mothers and nurses know what her remarks mean,  before other people know, as that “Guch” means “Give it to me at once,”   while “Wa” is “Why do you wear such a funny hat?” is because, mixing so  much with babies, they have picked up a little of the fairy language.    Of late David has been thinking back hard about the fairy tongue, with  his hands clutching his temples, and he has remembered a number of their  phrases which I shall tell you some day if I don’t forget. He had heard  them in the days when he was a thrush, and though I suggested to him  that perhaps it is really bird language he is remembering, he says not,  for these phrases are about fun and adventures, and the birds talked of  nothing but nest-building. He distinctly remembers that the birds used  to go from spot to spot like ladies at shop-windows, looking at the  different nests and saying, “Not my colour, my dear,” and “How would  that do with a soft lining?” and “But will it wear?” and “What hideous  trimming!” and so on.    The fairies are exquisite dancers, and that is why one of the first  things the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry  when you do it. They hold their great balls in the open air, in what  is called a fairy-ring. For weeks afterward you can see the ring on the  grass. It is not there when they begin, but they make it by waltzing  round and round. Sometimes you will find mushrooms inside the ring, and  these are fairy chairs that the servants have forgotten to clear away.  The chairs and the rings are the only tell-tale marks these little  people leave behind them, and they would remove even these were they not  so fond of dancing that they toe it till the very moment of the opening  of the gates. David and I once found a fairy-ring quite warm.    But there is also a way of finding out about the ball before it takes  place. You know the boards which tell at what time the Gardens are to  close to-day. Well, these tricky fairies sometimes slyly change the  board on a ball night, so that it says the Gardens are to close at  six-thirty for instance, instead of at seven. This enables them to get  begun half an hour earlier.    If on such a night we could remain behind in the Gardens, as the famous  Maimie Mannering did, we might see delicious sights, hundreds of  lovely fairies hastening to the ball, the married ones wearing their  wedding-rings round their waists, the gentlemen, all in uniform, holding  up the ladies’ trains, and linkmen running in front carrying winter  cherries, which are the fairy-lanterns, the cloakroom where they put  on their silver slippers and get a ticket for their wraps, the flowers  streaming up from the Baby Walk to look on, and always welcome because  they can lend a pin, the supper-table, with Queen Mab at the head of it,  and behind her chair the Lord Chamberlain, who carries a dandelion on  which he blows when Her Majesty wants to know the time.    The table-cloth varies according to the seasons, and in May it is made  of chestnut-blossom. The way the fairy-servants do is this: The men,  scores of them, climb up the trees and shake the branches, and the  blossom falls like snow. Then the lady servants sweep it together by  whisking their skirts until it is exactly like a table-cloth, and that  is how they get their table-cloth.    They have real glasses and real wine of three kinds, namely, blackthorn  wine, berberris wine, and cowslip wine, and the Queen pours out, but the  bottles are so heavy that she just pretends to pour out. There is bread  and butter to begin with, of the size of a threepenny bit; and cakes to  end with, and they are so small that they have no crumbs. The fairies  sit round on mushrooms, and at first they are very well-behaved and  always cough off the table, and so on, but after a bit they are not so  well-behaved and stick their fingers into the butter, which is got  from the roots of old trees, and the really horrid ones crawl over the  table-cloth chasing sugar or other delicacies with their tongues. When  the Queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and  put away, and then everybody adjourns to the dance, the Queen walking in  front while the Lord Chamberlain walks behind her, carrying two little  pots, one of which contains the juice of wall-flower and the other the  juice of Solomon’s Seals. Wall-flower juice is good for reviving dancers  who fall to the ground in a fit, and Solomon’s Seals juice is for  bruises. They bruise very easily and when Peter plays faster and faster  they foot it till they fall down in fits. For, as you know without my  telling you, Peter Pan is the fairies’ orchestra. He sits in the middle  of the ring, and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays  without him. “P. P.” is written on the corner of the invitation-cards  sent out by all really good families. They are grateful little people,  too, and at the princess’s coming-of-age ball (they come of age on their  second birthday and have a birthday every month) they gave him the wish  of his heart.    The way it was done was this. The Queen ordered him to kneel, and then  said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his  heart. Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of  his heart, but for a long time he hesitated, not being certain what it  was himself.    “If I chose to go back to mother,” he asked at last, “could you give me  that wish?”    Now this question vexed them, for were he to return to his mother they  should lose his music, so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and  said, “Pooh, ask for a much bigger wish than that.”    “Is that quite a little wish?” he inquired.    “As little as this,” the Queen answered, putting her hands near each  other.    “What size is a big wish?” he asked.    She measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length.    Then Peter reflected and said, “Well, then, I think I shall have two  little wishes instead of one big one.”    Of course, the fairies had to agree, though his cleverness rather  shocked them, and he said that his first wish was to go to his  mother, but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her  disappointing. His second wish he would hold in reserve.    They tried to dissuade him, and even put obstacles in the way.    “I can give you the power to fly to her house,” the Queen said, “but I  can’t open the door for you.”    “The window I flew out at will be open,” Peter said confidently. “Mother  always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back.    “How do you know?” they asked, quite surprised, and, really, Peter could  not explain how he knew.    “I just do know,” he said.    So as he persisted in his wish, they had to grant it. The way they gave  him power to fly was this: They all tickled him on the shoulder, and  soon he felt a funny itching in that part and then up he rose higher and  higher and flew away out of the Gardens and over the house-tops.    It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his old home he  skimmed away over St. Paul’s to the Crystal Palace and back by the river  and Regent’s Park, and by the time he reached his mother’s window he had  quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird.    The window was wide open, just as he knew it would be, and in he  fluttered, and there was his mother lying asleep.    Peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had  a good look at her. She lay with her head on her hand, and the hollow  in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair. He  remembered, though he had long forgotten it, that she always gave her  hair a holiday at night.    How sweet the frills of her night-gown were. He was very glad she was  such a pretty mother.    But she looked sad, and he knew why she looked sad. One of her arms  moved as if it wanted to go round something, and he knew what it wanted  to go round.    “Oh, mother,” said Peter to himself, “if you just knew who is sitting on  the rail at the foot of the bed.”    Very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made, and he could  see by her face that she liked it. He knew he had but to say “Mother”   ever so softly, and she would wake up. They always wake up at once if it  is you that says their name. Then she would give such a joyous cry  and squeeze him tight. How nice that would be to him, but oh, how  exquisitely delicious it would be to her. That I am afraid is how Peter  regarded it. In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was  giving her the greatest treat a woman can have. Nothing can be more  splendid, he thought, than to have a little boy of your own. How proud  of him they are; and very right and proper, too.    But why does Peter sit so long on the rail, why does he not tell his  mother that he has come back?    I quite shrink from the truth, which is that he sat there in two minds.  Sometimes he looked longingly at his mother, and sometimes he looked  longingly at the window. Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy  again, but, on the other hand, what times those had been in the Gardens!  Was he so sure that he would enjoy wearing clothes again? He popped off  the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments. They  were still there, but he could not remember how you put them on. The  socks, for instance, were they worn on the hands or on the feet? He was  about to try one of them on his hand, when he had a great adventure.  Perhaps the drawer had creaked; at any rate, his mother woke up, for  he heard her say “Peter,” as if it was the most lovely word in the  language. He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath,  wondering how she knew that he had come back. If she said “Peter” again,  he meant to cry “Mother” and run to her. But she spoke no more, she  made little moans only, and when next he peeped at her she was once more  asleep, with tears on her face.    It made Peter very miserable, and what do you think was the first  thing he did? Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed, he played a  beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe. He had made it up himself  out of the way she said “Peter,” and he never stopped playing until she  looked happy.    He thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening  her to hear her say, “Oh, Peter, how exquisitely you play.” However, as  she now seemed comfortable, he again cast looks at the window. You must  not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back. He had  quite decided to be his mother’s boy, but hesitated about beginning  to-night. It was the second wish which troubled him. He no longer meant  to make it a wish to be a bird, but not to ask for a second wish seemed  wasteful, and, of course, he could not ask for it without returning to  the fairies. Also, if he put off asking for his wish too long it might  go bad. He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted to fly away  without saying good-bye to Solomon. “I should like awfully to sail in my  boat just once more,” he said wistfully to his sleeping mother. He quite  argued with her as if she could hear him. “It would be so splendid to  tell the birds of this adventure,” he said coaxingly. “I promise to come  back,” he said solemnly and meant it, too.    And in the end, you know, he flew away. Twice he came back from the  window, wanting to kiss his mother, but he feared the delight of it  might waken her, so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe, and  then he flew back to the Gardens.    Many nights and even months passed before he asked the fairies for his  second wish; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long.  One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say, not only to his  particular friends, but to a hundred favourite spots. Then he had his  last sail, and his very last sail, and his last sail of all, and so on.  Again, a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour; and another  comfortable reason was that, after all, there was no hurry, for his  mother would never weary of waiting for him. This last reason displeased  old Solomon, for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate.  Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work,  such as “Never put off laying to-day, because you can lay to-morrow,”   and “In this world there are no second chances,” and yet here was Peter  gaily putting off and none the worse for it. The birds pointed this out  to each other, and fell into lazy habits.    But, mind you, though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother,  he was quite decided to go back. The best proof of this was his caution  with the fairies. They were most anxious that he should remain in the  Gardens to play to them, and to bring this to pass they tried to trick  him into making such a remark as “I wish the grass was not so wet,” and  some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry, “I do  wish you would keep time!” Then they would have said that this was his  second wish. But he smoked their design, and though on occasions he  began, “I wish--” he always stopped in time. So when at last he said  to them bravely, “I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always,”   they had to tickle his shoulder and let him go.    He went in a hurry in the end because he had dreamt that his mother was  crying, and he knew what was the great thing she cried for, and that a  hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile. Oh, he felt  sure of it, and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this  time he flew straight to the window, which was always to be open for  him.    But the window was closed, and there were iron bars on it, and peering  inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another  little boy.    Peter called, “Mother! mother!” but she heard him not; in vain he beat  his little limbs against the iron bars. He had to fly back, sobbing, to  the Gardens, and he never saw his dear again. What a glorious boy he had  meant to be to her. Ah, Peter, we who have made the great mistake, how  differently we should all act at the second chance. But Solomon was  right; there is no second chance, not for most of us. When we reach the  window it is Lock-out Time. The iron bars are up for life.

22,Paul Kelverr,"In the Corn Exchange!” Maybe it would convince us further  were she to run through a passage here and there, say Lady Macbeth's  sleep-walking scene, or from Ophelia's entrance in the fourth act? It  would be no trouble; her memory was excellent. We would hasten to assure  her of our perfect faith.    Listening to her, it was difficult, as she herself would frankly admit,  to imagine her the once “arch Miss Lucretia Barry;” looking at her, to  remember there had been an evening when she had been “the cynosure of  every eye.” One found it necessary to fortify oneself with perusal of  underlined extracts from ancient journals, much thumbed and creased,  thoughtfully lent to one for the purpose. Since those days Fate had  woven round her a mantle of depression. She was now a faded, watery-eyed  little woman, prone on the slightest provocation to sit down suddenly on  the nearest chair and at once commence a history of her troubles. Quite  unconscious of this failing, it was an idea of hers that she was an  exceptionally cheerful person.    “But there, fretting's no good. We must grin and bear things in this  world,” she would conclude, wiping her eyes upon her apron. “It's better  to laugh than to cry, I always say.” And to prove that this was no mere  idle sentiment, she would laugh then and there upon the spot.    Much stair-climbing had bestowed upon her a shortness of breath, which  no amount of panting in her resting moments was able to make good.    “You don't know 'ow to breathe,” explained our second floor front to  her on one occasion, a kindly young man; “you don't swallow it, you  only gargle with it. Take a good draught and shut your mouth; don't  be frightened of it; don't let it out again till it's done something:  that's what it's 'ere for.”    He stood over her with his handkerchief pressed against her mouth to  assist her; but it was of no use.    “There don't seem any room for it inside me,” she explained.    Bells had become to her the business of life; she lived listening  for them. Converse to her was a filling in of time while waiting for  interruptions.    A bottle of whiskey fell into my hands that Christmas time, a present  from a commercial traveller in the way of business. Not liking whiskey  myself, it was no sacrifice for me to reserve it for the occasional  comfort of Mrs. Peedles, when, breathless, with her hands to her side,  she would sink upon the chair nearest to my door. Her poor, washed-out  face would lighten at the suggestion.    “Ah, well,” she would reply, “I don't mind if I do. It's a poor heart  that never rejoices.”    And then, her tongue unloosened, she would sit there and tell me stories  of my predecessors, young men lodgers who like myself had taken her  bed-sitting-rooms, and of the woes and misfortunes that had overtaken  them. I gathered that a more unlucky house I could not have selected.  A former tenant of my own room, of whom I strangely reminded her, had  written poetry on my very table. He was now in Portland doing five years  for forgery. Mrs. Peedles appeared to regard the two accomplishments as  merely different expressions of the same art. Another of her young men,  as she affectionately called us, had been of studious ambition. His  career up to a point appeared to have been brilliant. “What he mightn't  have been,” according to Mrs. Peedles, there was practically no saying;  what he happened to be at the moment of conversation was an unpromising  inmate of the Hanwell lunatic asylum.    “I've always noticed it,” Mrs. Peedles would explain; “it's always the  most deserving, those that try hardest, to whom trouble comes. I'm sure  I don't know why.”    I was glad on the whole when that bottle of whiskey was finished. A  second might have driven me to suicide.    There was no Mr. Peedles--at least, not for Mrs. Peedles, though as an  individual he continued to exist. He had been “general utility” at  the Princess's--the old terms were still in vogue at that time--a fine  figure of a man in his day, so I was given to understand, but one easily  led away, especially by minxes. Mrs. Peedles spoke bitterly of general  utilities as people of not much use.    For working days Mrs. Peedles had one dress and one cap, both black  and void of ostentation; but on Sundays and holidays she would appear  metamorphosed. She had carefully preserved the bulk of her stage  wardrobe, even to the paste-decked shoes and tinsel jewelry. Shapeless  in classic garb as Hermia, or bulgy in brocade and velvet as Lady  Teazle, she would receive her few visitors on Sunday evenings, discarded  puppets like herself, with whom the conversation was of gayer nights  before their wires had been cut; or, her glory hid from the ribald  street beneath a mackintosh, pay her few calls. Maybe it was the unusual  excitement that then brought colour into her furrowed cheeks, that  straightened and darkened her eyebrows, at other times so singularly  unobtrusive. Be this how it may, the change was remarkable, only  the thin grey hair and the work-worn hands remaining for purposes of  identification. Nor was the transformation merely one of surface.  Mrs. Peedles hung on her hook behind the kitchen door, dingy, limp,  discarded; out of the wardrobe with the silks and satins was lifted down  to be put on as an undergarment Miss Lucretia Barry, like her costumes  somewhat aged, somewhat withered, but still distinctly “arch.”    In the room next to me lived a law-writer and his wife. They were very  old and miserably poor. The fault was none of theirs. Despite copy-books  maxims, there is in this world such a thing as ill-luck-persistent,  monotonous, that gradually wears away all power of resistance. I  learned from them their history: it was hopelessly simple, hopelessly  uninstructive. He had been a schoolmaster, she a pupil teacher; they had  married young, and for a while the world had smiled upon them. Then came  illness, attacking them both: nothing out of which any moral could be  deduced, a mere case of bad drains resulting in typhoid fever. They had  started again, saddled by debt, and after years of effort had succeeded  in clearing themselves, only to fall again, this time in helping a  friend. Nor was it even a case of folly: a poor man who had helped them  in their trouble, hardly could they have done otherwise without proving  themselves ungrateful. And so on, a tedious tale, commonplace, trivial.  Now listless, patient, hard working, they had arrived at an animal-like  indifference to their fate, content so long as they could obtain the  bare necessities of existence, passive when these were not forthcoming,  their interest in life limited to the one luxury of the poor--an  occasional glass of beer or spirits. Often days would go by without  his obtaining any work, and then they would more or less starve. Law  documents are generally given out to such men in the evening, to be  returned finished the next morning. Waking in the night, I would hear  through the thin wooden partition that divided our rooms the even  scratching of his pen.    Thus cheek by jowl we worked, I my side of the screen, he his: youth and  age, hope and realisation.    Out of him my fears fashioned a vision of the future. Past his door I  would slink on tiptoe, dread meeting him upon the stairs. Once had not  he said to himself: “The world's mine oyster?” May not the voices of the  night have proclaimed him also king? Might I not be but an idle dreamer,  mistaking desire for power? Would not the world prove stronger than I?  At such times I would see my life before me: the clerkship at thirty  shillings a week rising by slow instalments, it may be, to one hundred  and fifty a year; the four-roomed house at Brixton; the girl wife,  pretty, perhaps, but sinking so soon into the slatternly woman; the  squalling children. How could I, unaided, expect to raise myself from  the ruck? Was not this the more likely picture?    Our second floor front was a young fellow in the commercial line. Jarman  was Young London personified--blatant yet kind-hearted; aggressively  self-assertive, generous to a fault; cunning, yet at the same time  frank; shrewd, cheery, and full of pluck. “Never say die” was his motto,  and anything less dead it would be difficult to imagine. All day long  he was noisy, and all night long he snored. He woke with a start, bathed  like a porpoise, sang while dressing, roared for his boots, and  whistled during his breakfast. His entrance and exit were always to an  orchestration of banging doors, directions concerning his meals shouted  at the top of his voice as he plunged up or down the stairs, the  clattering and rattling of brooms and pails flying before his feet. His  departure always left behind it the suggestion that the house was now to  let; it came almost as a shock to meet a human being on the landing. He  would have conveyed an atmosphere of bustle to the Egyptian pyramids.    Sometimes carrying his own supper-tray, arranged for two, he would march  into my room. At first, resenting his familiarity, I would hint at my  desire to be alone, would explain that I was busy.    “You fire away, Shakespeare Redivivus,” he would reply. “Don't delay the  tragedy. Why should London wait? I'll keep quiet.”    But his notion of keeping quiet was to retire into a corner and there  amuse himself by enacting a tragedy of his own in a hoarse whisper,  accompanied by appropriate gesture.    “Ah, ah!” I would hear him muttering to himself, “I 'ave killed 'er good  old father; I 'ave falsely accused 'er young man of all the crimes that  I 'ave myself committed; I 'ave robbed 'er of 'er ancestral estates. Yet  she loves me not! It is streeange!” Then changing his bass to a shrill  falsetto: “It is a cold and dismal night: the snow falls fast. I will  leave me 'at and umbrella be'ind the door and go out for a walk with the  chee-ild. Aha! who is this? 'E also 'as forgotten 'is umbrella. Ah, now  I know 'im in the pitch dark by 'is cigarette! Villain, murderer, silly  josser! it is you!” Then with lightning change of voice and gesture:  “Mary, I love yer!” “Sir Jasper Murgatroyd, let me avail myself of this  opportunity to tell you what I think of you--” “No, no; the 'ouses close  in 'alf an hour; there is not tee-ime. Fly with me instead!” “Never!  Un'and me!” “'Ear me! Ah, what 'ave I done? I 'ave slipped upon a piece  of orange peel and broke me 'ead! If you will kindly ask them to turn  off the snow and give me a little moonlight, I will confess all.”    Finding it (much to Jarman's surprise) impossible to renew the thread of  my work, I would abandon my attempts at literature, and instead listen  to his talk, which was always interesting. His conversation was, it is  true, generally about himself, but it was none the less attractive on  that account. His love affairs, which appeared to be numerous, formed  his chief topic. There was no reserve about Jarman: his life contained  no secret chambers. What he “told her straight,” what she “up and said  to him” in reply was for all the world that cared to hear. So far his  search after the ideal had met with but ill success.    “Girls,” he would say, “they're all alike, till you know 'em. So long as  they're trying to palm themselves off on yer, they'll persuade you  there isn't such another article in all the market. When they've got yer  order--ah, then yer find out what they're really made of. And you take  it from me, 'Omer Junior, most of 'em are put together cheap. Bah!  it sickens me sometimes to read the way you paper-stainers talk about 'em  --angels, goddesses, fairies! They've just been getting at yer. You're  giving 'em just the price they're asking without examining the article.  Girls ain't a special make, like what you seem to think 'em. We're all  turned out of the same old slop shop.”    “Not that I say, mind yer,” he would continue, “that there are none of  the right sort. They're to be 'ad--real good 'uns. All I say is, taking  'em at their own valuation ain't the way to do business with 'em.”    What he was on the look out for--to quote his own description--was a  really first class article, not something from which the paint would  come off almost before you got it home.    “They're to be found,” he would cheerfully affirm, “but you've got to  look for 'em. They're not the sort that advertises.”    Behind Jarman in the second floor back resided one whom Jarman had  nicknamed “The Lady 'Ortensia.” I believe before my arrival there had  been love passages between the two; but neither of them, so I gathered,  had upon closer inspection satisfied the other's standard. Their present  attitude towards each other was that of insult thinly veiled under  exaggerated politeness. Miss Rosina Sellars was, in her own language,  a “lady assistant,” in common parlance, a barmaid at the Ludgate Hill  Station refreshment room. She was a large, flabby young woman. With less  powder, her complexion might by admirers have been termed creamy; as it  was, it presented the appearance rather of underdone pastry. To be on  all occasions “quite the lady” was her pride. There were those who held  the angle of her dignity to be exaggerated. Jarman would beg her for her  own sake to be more careful lest one day she should fall down backwards  and hurt herself. On the other hand, her bearing was certainly  calculated to check familiarity. Even stockbrokers' clerks--young men  as a class with the bump of reverence but poorly developed--would in her  presence falter and grow hesitating. She had cultivated the art of  not noticing to something approaching perfection. She could draw the  noisiest customer a glass of beer, which he had never ordered; exchange  it for three of whiskey, which he had; take his money and return him his  change without ever seeing him, hearing him, or knowing he was there. It  shattered the self-assertion of the youngest of commercial travellers.  Her tone and manner, outside rare moments of excitement, were suggestive  of an offended but forgiving iceberg. Jarman invariably passed her with  his coat collar turned up to his ears, and even thus protected might  have been observed to shiver. Her stare, in conjunction with her “I beg  your pardon!” was a moral douche that would have rendered apologetic and  explanatory Don Juan himself.    To me she was always gracious, which by contrast to her general attitude  towards my sex of studied disdain, I confess flattered me. She was good  enough to observe to Mrs. Peedles, who repeated it to me, that I was the  only gentleman in the house who knew how to behave himself.    The entire first floor was occupied by an Irishman and--they never  minced the matter themselves, so hardly is there need for me to do so.  She was a charming little dark-eyed woman, an ex-tight-rope dancer, and  always greatly offended Mrs. Peedles by claiming Miss Lucretia Barry as  a sister artiste.    “Of course I don't know how it may be now,” would reply Mrs. Peedles,  with some slight asperity; “but in my time we ladies of the legitimate  stage used to look down upon dancers and such sort. Of course, no  offence to you, Mrs. O'Kelly.”    Neither of them was in the least offended.    “Sure, Mrs. Peedles, ye could never have looked down upon the Signora,”   the O'Kelly would answer laughing. “Ye had to lie back and look up to  her. Why, I've got the crick in me neck to this day!”    “Ah! my dear, and you don't know how nervous I was when glancing down  I'd see his handsome face just underneath me, thinking that with one  false step I might spoil it for ever,” would reply the Signora.    “Me darling! I'd have died happy, just smothered in loveliness!” would  return the O'Kelly; and he and the Signora would rush into each other's  arms, and the sound of their kisses would quite excite the little slavey  sweeping down the stairs outside.    He was a barrister attached in theory to the Western Circuit; in  practice, somewhat indifferent to it, much more attached to the lower  strata of Bohemia and the Signora. At the present he was earning all  sufficient for the simple needs of himself and the Signora as a teacher  of music and singing. His method was simple and suited admirably the  locality. Unless specially requested, he never troubled his pupils with  such tiresome things as scales and exercises. His plan was to discover  the song the young man fancied himself singing, the particular jingle  the young lady yearned to knock out of the piano, and to teach it to  them. Was it “Tom Bowling?” Well and good. Come on; follow your leader.  The O'Kelly would sing the first line.    “Now then, try that. Don't be afraid. Just open yer mouth and gave it  tongue. That's all right. Everything has a beginning. Sure, later on,  we'll get the time and tune, maybe a little expression.”    Whether the system had any merit in it, I cannot answer. Certain it was  that as often as not it achieved success. Gradually--say, by the end  of twelve eighteen-penny lessons--out of storm and chaos “Tom Bowling”   would emerge, recognisable for all men to hear. Had the pupil any voice  to start with, the O'Kelly improved it; had he none, the O'Kelly would  help him to disguise the fact.    “Take it easy, now; take it easy,” the O'Kelly would counsel. “Sure,  it's a delicate organ, yer voice. Don't ye strain it now. Ye're at yer  best when ye're just low and sweet.”    So also with the blushing pianiste. At the end of a month a tune was  distinctly discernible; she could hear it herself, and was happy. His  repute spread.    Twice already had he eloped with the Signora (and twice again was he  to repeat the operation, before I finally lost sight of him: to break  oneself of habit is always difficult) and once by well-meaning friends  had he been induced to return to home, if not to beauty. His wife, who  was considerably older than himself, possessed, so he would inform  me with tears in his eyes, every moral excellence that should attract  mankind. Upon her goodness and virtue, her piety and conscientiousness  he would descant to me by the half hour. His sincerity it was impossible  to question. It was beyond doubt that he respected her, admired her,  honoured her. She was a saint, an angel--a wretch, a villain such as he,  was not fit to breathe the same pure air. To do him justice, it must  be admitted he showed no particular desire to do so. As an aunt or  grandmother, I believe he would have suffered her gladly. He had nothing  to say against her, except that he found himself unable to live with  her.    That she must have been a lady of exceptional merit one felt convinced.  The Signora, who had met her only once, and then under somewhat trying  conditions, spoke her praises with equal enthusiasm. Had she, the  Signora, enjoyed the advantage of meeting such a model earlier, she,  the Signora, might have been a better woman. It seemed a pity the  introduction could not have taken place sooner and under different  circumstances. Could they both have adopted her as a sort of mutual  mother-in-law, it would have given them, I am positive, the greatest  satisfaction. On her occasional visits they would have vied with each  other in showing her affectionate attention. For the deserted lady I  tried to feel sorry, but could not avoid the reflection that it  would have been better for all parties had she been less patient and  forgiving. Her husband was evidently much more suited to the Signora.    Indeed, the relationship between these two was more a true marriage than  one generally meets with. No pair of love-birds could have been more  snug together. In their virtues and failings alike they fitted each  other. When sober the immorality of their behaviour never troubled them;  in fact, when sober nothing ever troubled them. They laughed, joked,  played through life, two happy children. To be shocked at them was  impossible. I tried it and failed.    But now and again there came an evening when they were not sober. It  happened when funds were high. On such occasion the O'Kelly would return  laden with bottles of a certain sweet champagne, of which they were both  extremely fond; and a friend or two would be invited to share in the  festivity. Whether any exceptional quality resided in this particular  brand of champagne I am not prepared to argue; my own personal  experience of it has prompted me to avoid it for the rest of my life.  Its effect upon them was certainly unique. Instead of intoxicating them,  it sobered them: there is no other way of explaining it. With the third  or fourth glass they began to take serious views of life. Before the end  of the second bottle they would be staring at each other, appalled  at contemplation of their own transgression. The Signora, the tears  streaming down her pretty face, would declare herself a wicked, wicked  woman; she had dragged down into shame the most blameless, the most  virtuous of men. Emptying her glass, she would bury her face in her  hands, and with her elbows on her knees, in an agony of remorse, sit  rocking to and fro. The O'Kelly, throwing himself at her feet, would  passionately abjure her to “look up.” She had, it appeared, got hold of  the thing at the wrong end; it was he who had dragged her down.    At this point metaphor would become confused. Each had been dragged  down by the other one and ruined; also each one was the other one's good  angel. All that was commendable in the Signora, she owed to the O'Kelly.  Whatever was not discreditable about the O'Kelly was in the nature of a  loan from the Signora. With the help of more champagne the right course  would grow plain to them. She would go back broken-hearted but repentant  to the tight-rope; he would return a better but a blighted man to  Mrs. O'Kelly and the Western Circuit. This would be their last evening  together on earth. A fresh bottle would be broached, and the guest or  guests called upon to assist in the ceremony of renunciation; glasses  full to the brim this time.    So much tragedy did they continue to instil into the scene that on the  first occasion of my witnessing it I was unable to refrain from mingling  my tears with theirs. As, however, the next morning they had forgotten  all about it, and as nothing came of it, nor of several subsequent  repetitions, I should have believed a separation between them impossible  but that even while I was an inmate of the house the thing actually  happened.    It came about in this wise. His friends, having discovered him, had  pointed out to him again his duty. The Signora--a really excellent  little woman so far as intention was concerned--had seconded their  endeavours, with the result that on a certain evening in autumn we of  the house assembled all of us on the first floor to support them on the  occasion of their final--so we all deemed it then--leave-taking. For  eleven o'clock two four-wheeled cabs had been ordered, one to transport  the O'Kelly with his belongings to Hampstead and respectability; in the  other the Signora would journey sorrowfully to the Tower Basin, there to  join a circus company sailing for the Continent.    I knocked at the door some quarter of an hour before the appointed hour  of the party. I fancy the idea had originated with the Signora.    “Dear Willie has something to say to you,” she had informed me that  morning on the stairs. “He has taken a sincere liking to you, and it is  something very important.”    They were sitting one each side the fireplace, looking very serious; a  bottle of the sobering champagne stood upon the table. The Signora rose  and kissed me gravely on the brow; the O'Kelly laid both hands upon my  shoulders, and sat me down on a chair between them.    “Mr. Kelver,” said the Signora, “you are very young.”    I hinted--it was one of those rare occasions upon which gallantry can be  combined with truth--that I found myself in company.    The Signora smiled sadly, and shook her head.    “Age,” said the O'Kelly, “is a matter of feeling. Kelver, may ye never  be as old as I am feeling now.”    “As _we_ are feeling,” corrected the Signora. “Kelver,” said the  O'Kelly, pouring out a third glass of champagne, “we want ye to promise  us something.”    “It will make us both happier,” added the Signora.    “That ye will take warning,” continued the O'Kelly, “by our wretched  example. Paul, in this world there is only one path to possible  happiness. The path of strict--” he paused.    “Propriety,” suggested the Signora.    “Of strict propriety,” agreed the O'Kelly. “Deviate from it,” continued  the O'Kelly, impressively, “and what is the result?”    “Unutterable misery,” supplied the Signora.    “Ye think we two have been happy here together,” said the O'Kelly.    I replied that such was the conclusion to which observation had directed  me.    “We tried to appear so,” explained the Signora; “it was merely on the  outside. In reality all the time we hated each other. Tell him, Willie,  dear, how we have hated each other.”    “It is impossible,” said the O'Kelly, finishing and putting down his  glass, “to give ye any idea, Kelver, how we have hated each other.”    “How we have quarrelled!” said the Signora. “Tell him, dear, how we have  quarrelled.”    “All day long and half the night,” concluded the O'Kelly.    “Fought,” added the Signora. “You see, Mr. Kelver, people in--in our  position always do. If it had been otherwise, if--if everything had been  proper, then of course we should have loved each other. As it is, it has  been a cat and dog existence. Hasn't it been a cat and dog existence,  Willie?”    “It's been just hell upon earth,” murmured the O'Kelly, with his eyes  fixed gloomily upon the fire-stove ornament. Deadly in earnest though  they both were, I could not repress a laugh, their excellent intention  was so obvious. The Signora burst into tears.    “He doesn't believe us,” she wailed.    “Me dear,” replied the O'Kelly, throwing up his part with promptness and  satisfaction, “how could ye expect it? How could he believe that any man  could look at ye and hate ye?”    “It's all my fault,” cried the little woman; “I am such a wicked  creature. I cannot even be miserable when I am doing wrong. A decent  woman in my place would have been wretched and unhappy, and made  everybody about her wretched and unhappy, and so have set a good example  and have been a warning. I don't seem to have any conscience, and I do  try.” The poor little lady was sobbing her heart out.    When not shy I could be sensible, and of the O'Kelly and the Signora one  could be no more shy than of a pair of robin redbreasts. Besides, I was  really fond of them; they had been very good to me.    “Dear Miss Beltoni,” I answered, “I am going to take warning by you  both.”    She pressed my hand. “Oh, do, please do,” she murmured. “We really have  been miserable--now and then.”    “I am never going to be content,” I assured her, “until I find a lady  as charming and as amiable as you, and if ever I get her I'll take good  care never to run any risk of losing her.”    It sounded well and pleased us all. The O'Kelly shook me warmly by the  hand, and this time spoke his real feelings.    “Me boy,” he said, “all women are good--for somebody. But the woman that  is good for yerself is better for ye than a better woman who's the best  for somebody else. Ye understand?”    I said I did.    At eight o'clock precisely Mrs. Peedles arrived--as Flora MacDonald, in  green velvet jacket and twelve to fifteen inches of plaid stocking. As  a topic fitting the occasion we discussed the absent Mr. Peedles and the  subject of deserted wives in general.    “A fine-looking man,” allowed Mrs. Peedles, “but weak--weak as water.”    The Signora agreed that unfortunately there did exist such men: 'twas  pitiful but true.    “My dear,” continued Mrs. Peedles, “she wasn't even a lady.”    The Signora expressed astonishment at the deterioration in Mr. Peedles'  taste thus implied.    “I won't go so far as to say we never had a difference,” continued Mrs.  Peedles, whose object appeared to be an impartial statement of the whole  case. “There may have been incompatability of temperament, as they say.  Myself, I have always been of a playful disposition--frivolous, some  might call me.”    The Signora protested; the O'Kelly declined to listen to such aspersion  on her character even from Mrs. Peedles herself.    Mrs. Peedles, thus corrected, allowed that maybe frivolous was too  sweeping an accusation: say sportive.    “But a good wife to him I always was,” asserted Mrs. Peedles, with a  fine sense of justice; “never flighty, like some of them. I challenge  any one to accuse me of having been flighty.”    We felt we should not believe any one who did, and told her so.    Mrs. Peedles, drawing her chair closer to the Signora, assumed a  confidential attitude. “If they want to go, let 'em go, I always say,”   she whispered loudly into the Signora's ear. “Ten to one they'll find  they've only jumped out of the frying-pan into the fire. One can always  comfort oneself with that.”    There seemed to be confusion in the mind of Mrs. Peedles. Her virtuous  sympathies, I gathered, were with the Signora. Mr. O'Kelly's return  to Mrs. O'Kelly evidently manifested itself in the light of a shameful  desertion. Having regard to the fact, patent to all who knew him, that  the poor fellow was sacrificing every inclination to stern sense of  duty, such view of the matter was rough on him. But philosophers from  all ages have agreed that our good deeds are the whips with which Fate  punishes us for our bad.    “My dear,” continued Mrs. Peedles, “when Mr. Peedles left me I thought  that I should never smile again. Yet here you see me laughing away  through life, just as ever. You'll get over it all right.” And Mrs.  Peedles wiped away her tears and smiled upon the Signora; upon which the  Signora commenced to cry again.    Happily, timely diversion was made at this point by the bursting into  the room of Jarman, who upon perceiving Mrs. Peedles, at once gave vent  to a hoot, supposed to be expressive of Scottish joy, and without a  moment's hesitation commenced to dance a reel.    My neighbours of the first floor knocked at the door a little while  afterwards; and genteelly late arrived Miss Rosina Sellars, coldly  gleaming in a decollete but awe-inspiring costume of mingled black  and scarlet, out of which her fair, if fleshy, neck and arms shone  luxuriant.    We did not go into supper; instead, supper came into us from the  restaurant at the corner of the Blackfriars Road. I cannot say that at  first it was a festive meal. The O'Kelly and the Signora made effort,  as in duty bound, to be cheerful, but for awhile were somewhat  unsuccessful. The third floor front wasted no time in speech, but ate  and drank copiously. Miss Sellars, retaining her gloves--which was  perhaps wise, her hands being her weak point--signalled me out, much to  my embarrassment, as the recipient of her most polite conversation. Mrs.  Peedles became reminiscent of parties generally. Seeing that most of  Mrs. Peedles' former friends and acquaintances were either dead or in  more or less trouble, her efforts did not tend to enliven the table. One  gathering, of which the present strangely reminded her, was a funeral,  chiefly remarkable from discovery of the romantic fact, late in the  proceedings, that the gentleman in whose honour the whole affair had  been organised was not dead at all; but instead, having taken advantage  of an error arising out of a railway accident, was at the moment eloping  with the wife of his own chief mourner. As Mrs. Peedles explained,  and as one could well credit, it had been an awkward position for all  present. Nobody had quite known whether to feel glad or sorry--with the  exception of the chief mourner, upon whose personal undertaking that the  company might regard the ceremony as merely postponed, festivities came  to an end.    Our prop and stay from a convivial point of view was Jarman. As  a delicate attention to Mrs. Peedles and her costume he sunk  his nationality and became for the evening, according to his own  declaration, “a braw laddie.” With her--his “sonsie lassie,” so he  termed her--he flirted in the broadest, if not purest, Scotch. The  O'Kelly for him became “the Laird;” the third floor “Jamie o' the Ilk;”   Miss Sellars, “the bonnie wee rose;” myself, “the chiel.” Periods of  silence were dispersed by suggestions that we should “hoot awa',” Jarman  himself setting us the example.    With the clearance away of the eatables, making room for the production  of a more varied supply of bottles, matters began to mend. Mrs. Peedles  became more arch, Jarman's Scotch more striking and extensive, the  Lady 'Ortensia's remarks less depressingly genteel, her aitches less  accentuated.    Jarman rose to propose the health of the O'Kelly, coupled with that of  the Signora. To the O'Kelly, in a burst of generosity, Jarman promised  our united patronage. To Jarman it appeared that by employing the  O'Kelly to defend us whenever we got into trouble with the police, and  by recommending him to our friends, a steady income should be assured to  him.    The O'Kelly replied feelingly to the effect that Nelson Square,  Blackfriars, would ever remain engraved upon his memory as the fairest  and brightest spot on earth. Personally, nothing would have given him  greater pleasure than to die among the dear friends who now surrounded  him. But there was such a thing as duty, and he and the Signora had come  to the conclusion that true happiness could only be obtained by acting  according to one's conscience, even if it made one miserable.    Jarman, warming to his work, then proposed the health of Mrs. Peedles,  as true-hearted and hard-breathing a lady as ever it had been his  privilege to know. Her talent for cheery conversation was familiar to us  all, upon it he need not enlarge; all he would say was that personally  never did she go out of his room without leaving him more cheerful than  when she entered it.    After that--I forget in what--we drank the health of the Lady 'Ortensia.  Persons there were--Jarman would not attempt to disguise the fact--who  complained that the Lady 'Ortensia was too distant, “too stand-offish.”   With such complaint he himself had no sympathy; but tastes differed. If  the Lady 'Ortensia were inclined to be exclusive, who should blame her?  Everybody knew their own business best. For use in a second floor front  he could not honestly recommend the Lady 'Ortensia; it would not be  giving her a fair chance, and it would not be giving the second floor a  fair chance. But for any gentleman fitting up marble halls, for any one  on the lookout for a really “toney article,” Jarman would say: Inquire  for Miss Rosina Sellars, and see that you get her.    There followed my turn. There had been literary chaps in the past,  Jarman admitted so much. Against them he had nothing to say. They had no  doubt done their best. But the gentleman whose health Jarman wished the  company now to drink had this advantage over them: that they were  dead, and he wasn't. Some of this gentleman's work Jarman had read--in  manuscript; but that was a distinction purely temporary. He, Jarman,  claimed to be no judge of literature, but this he could and would say,  it took a good deal to make him miserable, yet this the literary efforts  of Mr. Kelver invariably accomplished.    Mrs. Peedles, speaking without rising, from personal observation in the  daytime--which she hoped would not be deemed a liberty; literature, even  in manuscript, being, so to speak, public property--found herself in a  position to confirm all that Mr. Jarman had remarked. Speaking as one  not entirely without authority on the subject of literature and the  drama, Mrs. Peedles could say that passages she had read had struck her  as distinctly not half bad. Some of the love-scenes, in particular, had  made her to feel quite a girl again. How he had acquired such knowledge  was not for her to say. Cries of “Naughty!” from Jarman, and “Oh, Mr.  Kelver, I shall be quite afraid of you,” roguishly from Miss Sellars.    The O'Kelly, who, having abandoned his favourite champagne for less  sobering liquor, had since supper-time become rapidly more cheerful,  felt sure there was a future before me. That he had not seen any of my  work, so he assured me, in no way lessened his opinion of it. One thing  only would he impress upon me: that the best work was the result of  strict attention to virtue. His advice to me was to marry young and be  happy.    My persevering efforts of the last few months towards the acquisition of  convivial habits appeared this evening to be receiving their reward. The  O'Kelly's sweet champagne I had drunk with less dislike than hitherto; a  white, syrupy sort of stuff, out of a fat and artistic-looking bottle,  I had found distinctly grateful to the palate. Dimly the quotation about  taking things at the flood, and so getting on quickly, floated through  my brain, coupled with another one about fortune favouring the bold. It  had seemed to me a good occasion to try for the second time in my life  a full flavoured cigar. I had selected with the caution of a connoisseur  one of mottled green complexion from the O'Kelly's largest box. And so  far all had gone well. An easy self-confidence, delightful by reason of  its novelty, had replaced my customary shyness; a sense of lightness--of  positive airiness, emanating from myself, pervaded all things. Tossing  off another glass of the champagne, I rose to reply.    Modesty in my present mood would have been affectation. To such dear and  well-beloved friends I had no hesitation in admitting the truth, that I  was a clever fellow--a damned clever fellow. I knew it, they knew it, in  a short time everybody would know it. But they need not fear that in  the hour of my pride, when it arrived, I should prove ungrateful. Never  should I forget their kindness to me, a lonely young man, alone in a  lonely--Here the pathos of my own situation overcame me; words seemed  weak. “Jarman--” I meant, putting my hand upon his head, to have blessed  him for his goodness to me; but he being not exactly where he looked to  be, I just missed him, and sat down on the edge of my chair, which was a  hard one. I had not intended this to be the end of my speech, by a long  one; but Jarman, whispering to me: “Ended at exactly the right moment;  shows the born orator,” strong inclination to remain seated, now that I  was down seconding his counsel, and the company being clearly satisfied,  I decided to leave things where they were.    A delightful dreaminess was stealing over me. Everything and everybody  appeared to be a long way off, but, whether because of this or in  spite of it, exceedingly attractive. Never had I noticed the Signora  so bewitching; in a motherly sort of way even the third floor front was  good to look upon; Mrs. Peedles I could almost have believed to be the  real Flora MacDonald sitting in front of me. But the vision of Miss  Rosina Sellars made literally my head to swim. Never before had I dared  to cast upon female loveliness the satisfying gaze with which I now  boldly regarded her every movement. Evidently she noticed it, for she  turned away her eyes. I had heard that exceptionally strong-minded  people merely by concentrating their will could make other, ordinary  people, do just whatever they, the exceptionally strong-minded people,  wished. I willed that Miss Rosina Sellars should turn her eyes again  towards me. Victory crowned my efforts. Evidently I was one of these  exceptionally strong-minded persons. Slowly her eyes came round and met  mine with a smile--a helpless, pathetic smile that said, so I read it:  “You know no woman can resist you: be merciful!”    Inflamed by the brutal lust of conquest, I suppose I must have willed  still further, for the next thing I remember is sitting with Miss  Sellars on the sofa, holding her hand, the while the O'Kelly sang a  sentimental ballad, only one line of which comes back to me: “For the  angels must have told him, and he knows I love him now,” much stress  upon the “now.” The others had their backs towards us. Miss Sellars,  with a look that pierced my heart, dropped her somewhat large head upon  my shoulder, leaving, as I observed the next day, a patch of powder on  my coat.    Miss Sellars observed that one of the saddest things in the world was  unrequited love.    I replied gallantly, “Whateryou know about it?”    “Ah, you men, you men,” murmured Miss Sellars; “you're all alike.”    This suggested a personal aspersion on my character. “Not allus,” I  murmured.    “You don't know what love is,” said Miss Sellars. “You're not old  enough.”    The O'Kelly had passed on to Sullivan's “Sweethearts,” then in its first  popularity.         “Oh, love for a year--a week--a day!       But oh for the love that loves al-wa-ays!”    Miss Sellars' languishing eyes were fixed upon me; Miss Sellars' red  lips pouted and twitched; Miss Sellars' white bosom rose and fell.  Never, so it seemed to me, had so large an amount of beauty been  concentrated in one being.    “Yeserdo,” I said. “I love you.”    I stooped to kiss the red lips, but something was in my way. It turned  out to be a cold cigar. Miss Sellars thoughtfully removed it, and threw  it away. Our lips met. Her large arms closed about my neck and held me  tight.    “Well, I'm sure!” came the voice of Mrs. Peedles, as from afar. “Nice  goings on!”    I have vague remembrance of a somewhat heated discussion, in which  everybody but myself appeared to be taking extreme interest--of Miss  Sellars in her most ladylike and chilling tones defending me against the  charge of “being no gentleman,” which Mrs. Peedles was explaining nobody  had said I wasn't. The argument seemed to be of the circular order. No  gentleman had ever kissed Miss Sellars who had not every right to do so,  nor ever would. To kiss Miss Sellars without such right was to declare  oneself no gentleman. Miss Sellars appealed to me to clear my character  from the aspersion of being no gentleman. I was trying to understand  the situation, when Jarman, seizing me somewhat roughly by the arm,  suggested my going to bed. Miss Sellars, seizing my other arm, suggested  my refusing to go to bed. So far I was with Miss Sellars. I didn't want  to go to bed, and said so. My desire to sit up longer was proof positive  to Miss Sellars that I was a gentleman, but to no one else. The argument  shifted, the question being now as to whether Miss Sellars were a lady.  To prove the point it was, according to Miss Sellars, necessary that  I should repeat I loved her. I did repeat it, adding, with faint  remembrance of my own fiction, that if a life's devotion was likely to  be of the slightest further proof, my heart's blood was at her  service. This cleared the air, Mrs. Peedles observing that under such  circumstances it only remained for her to withdraw everything she had  said; to which Miss Sellars replied graciously that she had always known  Mrs. Peedles to be a good sort at the bottom.    Nevertheless, gaiety was gone from among us, and for this, in some way  I could not understand, I appeared to be responsible. Jarman was  distinctly sulky. The O'Kelly, suddenly thinking of the time, went to  the door and discovered that the two cabs were waiting. The third floor  recollected that work had to be finished. I myself felt sleepy.    Our host and hostess departed; Jarman again suggested bed, and this  time I agreed with him. After a slight misunderstanding with the door, I  found myself upon the stairs. I had never noticed before that they  were quite perpendicular. Adapting myself to the changed conditions, I  climbed them with the help of my hands. I accomplished the last flight  somewhat quickly, and feeling tired, sat down the moment I was within  my own room. Jarman knocked at the door. I told him to come in; but he  didn't. It occurred to me that the reason was I was sitting on the floor  with my back against the door. The discovery amused me exceedingly and  I laughed; and Jarman, baffled, descended to his own floor. I found  getting into bed a difficulty, owing to the strange behaviour of the  room. It spun round and round. Now the bed was just in front of me, now  it was behind me. I managed at last to catch it before it could get past  me, and holding on by the ironwork, frustrated its efforts to throw me  out again on to the floor.    But it was some time before I went to sleep, and over my intervening  experiences I draw a veil.        CHAPTER III.    GOOD FRIENDS SHOW PAUL THE ROAD TO FREEDOM. BUT BEFORE SETTING OUT, HE  WILL GO A-VISITING.    The sun was streaming into my window when I woke in the morning. I sat  up and listened. The roar of the streets told me plainly that the day  had begun without me. I reached out my hand for my watch; it was not in  its usual place upon the rickety dressing-table. I raised myself still  higher and looked about me. My clothes lay scattered on the floor. One  boot, in solitary state, occupied the chair by the fireplace; the other  I could not see anywhere.    During the night my head appeared to have grown considerably. I  wondered idly for the moment whether I had not made a mistake and put  on Minikin's; if so, I should be glad to exchange back for my own.  This thing I had got was a top-heavy affair, and was aching most  confoundedly.    Suddenly the recollection of the previous night rushed at me and shook  me awake. From a neighbouring steeple rang chimes: I counted with care.  Eleven o'clock. I sprang out of bed, and at once sat down upon the  floor.    I remembered how, holding on to the bed, I had felt the room waltzing  wildly round and round. It had not quite steadied itself even yet. It  was still rotating, not whirling now, but staggering feebly, as  though worn out by its all-night orgie. Creeping to the wash-stand, I  succeeded, after one or two false plunges, in getting my head inside  the basin. Then, drawing on my trousers with difficulty and reaching  the easy-chair, I sat down and reviewed matters so far as I was able,  commencing from the present and working back towards the past.    I was feeling very ill. That was quite clear. Something had disagreed  with me.    “That strong cigar,” I whispered feebly to myself; “I ought never to  have ventured upon it. And then the little room with all those people  in it. Besides, I have been working very hard. I must really take more  exercise.”    It gave me some satisfaction to observe that, shuffling and cowardly  though I might be, I was not a person easily bamboozled.    “Nonsense,” I told myself brutally; “don't try to deceive me. You were  drunk.”    “Not drunk,” I pleaded; “don't say drunk; it is such a coarse  expression. Some people cannot stand sweet champagne, so I have heard.  It affected my liver. Do please make it a question of liver.”    “Drunk,” I persisted unrelentingly, “hopelessly, vulgarly drunk--drunk  as any 'Arry after a Bank Holiday.”    “It is the first time,” I murmured.    “It was your first opportunity,” I replied.    “Never again,” I promised.    “The stock phrase,” I returned.    “How old are you?”    “Nineteen.”    “So you have not even the excuse of youth. How do you know that it will  not grow upon you; that, having thus commenced a downward career, you  will not sink lower and lower, and so end by becoming a confirmed sot?”    My heavy head dropped into my hands, and I groaned. Many a temperance  tale perused on Sunday afternoons came back to me. Imaginative in all  directions, I watched myself hastening toward a drunkard's grave, now  heroically struggling against temptation, now weakly yielding, the  craving growing upon me. In the misty air about me I saw my father's  white face, my mother's sad eyes. I thought of Barbara, of the scorn  that could quiver round that bewitching mouth; of Hal, with his  tremendous contempt for all forms of weakness. Shame of the present and  terror of the future between them racked my mind.    “It shall be never again!” I cried aloud. “By God, it shall!” (At  nineteen one is apt to be vehement.) “I will leave this house at once,”   I continued to myself aloud; “I will get away from its unwholesome  atmosphere. I will wipe it out of my mind, and all connected with it. I  will make a fresh start. I will--”    Something I had been dimly conscious of at the back of my brain came  forward and stood before me: the flabby figure of Miss Rosina Sellars.  What was she doing here? What right had she to step between me and my  regeneration?    “The right of your affianced bride,” my other half explained, with a  grim smile to myself.    “Did I really go so far as that?”    “We will not go into details,” I replied; “I do not wish to dwell upon  them. That was the result.”    “I was--I was not quite myself at the time. I did not know what I was  doing.”    “As a rule, we don't when we do foolish things; but we have to abide by  the consequences, all the same. Unfortunately, it happened to be in the  presence of witnesses, and she is not the sort of lady to be easily got  rid of. You will marry her and settle down with her in two small rooms.  Her people will be your people. You will come to know them better before  many days are passed. Among them she is regarded as 'the lady,' from  which you can judge of them. A nice commencement of your career, is it  not, my ambitious young friend? A nice mess you have made of it!”    “What am I to do?” I asked.    “Upon my word, I don't know,” I answered.    I passed a wretched day. Ashamed to face Mrs. Peedles or even the  slavey, I kept to my room, with the door locked. At dusk, feeling a  little better--or, rather, less bad, I stole out and indulged in a  simple meal, consisting of tea without sugar and a kippered herring, at  a neighbouring coffee-house. Another gentleman, taking his seat opposite  to me and ordering hot buttered toast, I left hastily.    At eight o'clock in the evening Minikin called round from the office to  know what had happened. Seeking help from shame, I confessed to him the  truth.    “Thought as much,” he answered. “Seems to have been an A1 from the look  of you.”    “I am glad it has happened, now it is over,” I said to him. “It will be  a lesson I shall never forget.”    “I know,” said Minikin. “Nothing like a fair and square drunk for making  you feel real good; better than a sermon.”    In my trouble I felt the need of advice; and Minikin, though my junior,  was, I knew, far more experienced in worldly affairs than I was.    “That's not the worst,” I confided to him. “What do you think I've  done?”    “Killed a policeman?” suggested Minikin.    “Got myself engaged.”    “No one like you quiet fellows for going it when you do begin,”   commented Minikin. “Nice girl?”    “I don't know,” I answered. “I only know I don't want her. How can I get  out of it?”    Minikin removed his left eye and commenced to polish it upon his  handkerchief, a habit he had when in doubt. From looking into it he  appeared to derive inspiration.    “Take-her-own-part sort of a girl?”    I intimated that he had diagnosed Miss Rosina Sellars correctly.    “Know how much you're earning?”    “She knows I live up here in this attic and do my own cooking,” I  answered.    Minikin glanced round the room. “Must be fond of you.”    “She thinks I'm clever,” I explained, “and that I shall make my way.    “And she's willing to wait?”    I nodded.    “Well, I should let her wait,” replied Minikin, replacing his eye.  “There's plenty of time before you.”    “But she's a barmaid, and she'll expect me to walk with her, to take her  out on Sundays, to go and see her friends. I can't do it. Besides, she's  right: I mean to get on. Then she'll stick to me. It's awful!”    “How did it happen?” asked Minikin.    “I don't know,” I replied. “I didn't know I had done it till it was  over.”    “Anybody present?”    “Half-a-dozen of them,” I groaned.    The door opened, and Jarman entered; he never troubled to knock  anywhere. In place of his usual noisy greeting, he crossed in silence  and shook me gravely by the hand.    “Friend of yours?” he asked, indicating Minikin.    I introduced them to each other.    “Proud to meet you,” said Jarman.    “Glad to hear it,” said Minikin. “Don't look as if you'd got much else  to be stuck up about.”    “Don't mind him,” I explained to Jarman. “He was born like it.”    “Wonderful gift” replied Jarman. “D'ye know what I should do if I 'ad  it?” He did not wait for Minikin's reply. “'Ire myself out to break up  evening parties. Ever thought of it seriously?”    Minikin replied that he would give the idea consideration.    “Make your fortune going round the suburbs,” assured him Jarman. “Pity  you weren't 'ere last night,” he continued; “might 'ave saved our young  friend 'ere a deal of trouble. Has 'e told you the news?”    I explained that I had already put Minikin in possession of all the  facts.    “Now you've got a good, steady eye,” said Jarman, upon whom Minikin,  according to his manner, had fixed his glass orb; “'ow d'ye think 'e is  looking?”    “As well as can be expected under the circumstances, don't you think?”   answered Minikin.    “Does 'e know the circumstances? Has 'e seen the girl?” asked Jarman.    I replied he had not as yet enjoyed that privilege. “Then 'e don't know  the worst,” said Jarman. “A hundred and sixty pounds of 'er, and still  growing! Bit of a load for 'im, ain't it?”    “Some of 'em do have luck,” was Minikin's rejoinder. Jarman  leant forward and took further stock for a few seconds of his new  acquaintance.    “That's a fine 'ead of yours,” he remarked; “all your own? No offence,”   continued Jarman, without giving Minikin time for repartee. “I was  merely thinking there must be room for a lot of sense in it. Now, what  do you, as a practical man, advise 'im: dose of poison, or Waterloo  Bridge and a brick?”    “I suppose there's no doubt,” I interjected, “that we are actually  engaged?”    “Not a blooming shadow,” assured me Jarman, cheerfully, “so far as she's  concerned.”    “I shall tell her plainly,” I explained, “that I was drunk at the time.”    “And 'ow are you going to convince 'er of it?” asked Jarman. “You think  your telling 'er you loved 'er proves it. So it would to anybody else,  but not to 'er. You can't expect it. Besides, if every girl is going to  give up 'er catch just because the fellow 'adn't all 'is wits about 'im  at the time--well, what do you think?” He appealed to Minikin.    To Minikin it appeared that if such contention were allowed girls might  as well shut up shop.    Jarman, who now that he had “got even” with Minikin, was more friendly  disposed towards that young man, drew his chair closer to him and  entered upon a private and confidential argument, from which I appeared  to be entirely excluded.    “You see,” explained Jarman, “this ain't an ordinary case. This chap's  going to be the future Poet Laureate. Now, when the Prince of Wales  invites him to dine at Marlborough 'ouse, 'e don't want to go there  tacked on to a girl that carries aitches with her in a bag, and don't  know which end of the spoon out of which to drink 'er soup.”    “It makes a difference, of course,” agreed Minikin.    “What we've got to do,” said Jarman, “is to get 'im out of it. And upon  my sivvy, blessed if I see 'ow to do it!”    “She fancies him?” asked Minikin.    “What she fancies,” explained Jarman, “is that nature intended 'er to be  a lady. And it's no good pointing out to 'er the mistake she's making,  because she ain't got sense enough to see it.”    “No good talking straight to her,” suggested Minikin, “telling her that  it can never be?”    “That's our difficulty,” replied Jarman; “it can be. This chap”--I  listened as might a prisoner in the dock to the argument of counsel,  interested but impotent--“don't know enough to come in out of the rain,  as the saying is. 'E's just the sort of chap this sort of thing does  'appen to.”    “But he don't want her,” urged Minikin. “He says he don't want her.”    “Yes, to you and me,” answered Jarman; “and of course 'e don't. I'm  not saying 'e's a natural born idiot. But let 'er come along and do  a snivel--tell 'im that 'e's breaking 'er 'eart, and appeal to 'im to  be'ave as a gentleman, and all that sort of thing, and what do you think  will be the result?”    Minikin agreed that the problem presented difficulties.    “Of course, if 'twas you or me, we should just tell 'er to put 'erself  away somewhere where the moth couldn't get at 'er and wait till we sent  round for 'er; and there'd be an end of the matter. But with 'im it's  different.”    “He is a bit of a soft,” agreed Minikin.    “'Tain't 'is fault,” explained Jarman; “'twas the way 'e was brought up.  'E fancies girls are the sort of things one sees in plays, going about  saying 'Un'and me!' 'Let me pass!' Maybe some of 'em are, but this ain't  one of 'em.”    “How did it happen?” asked Minikin.    “'Ow does it 'appen nine times out of ten?” returned Jarman. “'E was a  bit misty, and she was wide awake. 'E gets a bit spoony, and--well, you  know.”    “Artful things, girls,” commented Minikin.    “Can't blame 'em,” returned Jarman, with generosity; “it's their  business. Got to dispose of themselves somehow. Oughtn't to be binding  without a written order dated the next morning; that'd make it all  right.”    “Couldn't prove a prior engagement?” suggested Minikin.    “She'd want to see the girl first before she'd believe it--only  natural,” returned Jarman.    “Couldn't get a girl?” urged Minikin.    “Who could you trust?” asked the cautious Jarman. “Besides, there ain't  time. She's letting 'im rest to-day; to-morrow evening she'll be down on  'im.”    “Don't see anything for it,” said Minikin, “but for him to do a bunk.”    “Not a bad idea that,” mused Jarman; “only where's 'e to bunk to?”    “Needn't go far,” said Minikin.    “She'd find 'im out and follow 'im,” said Jarman. “She can look after  herself, mind you. Don't you go doing 'er any injustice.”    “He could change his name,” suggested Minikin.    “'Ow could 'e get a crib?” asked Jarman; “no character, no references.”    “I've got it,” cried Jarman, starting up; “the stage!”    “Can he act?” asked Minikin.    “Can do anything,” retorted my supporter, “that don't want too much  sense. That's 'is sanctuary, the stage. No questions asked, no character  wanted. Lord! why didn't I think of it before?”    “Wants a bit of getting on to, doesn't it?” suggested Minikin.    “Depends upon where you want to get,” replied Jarman. For the first  time since the commencement of the discussion he turned to me. “Can you  sing?” he asked me.    I replied that I could a little, though I had never done so in public.    “Sing something now,” demanded Jarman; “let's 'ear you. Wait a minute!”   he cried.    He slipped out of the room. I heard him pause upon the landing below  and knock at the door of the fair Rosina's room. The next minute he  returned.    “It's all right,” he explained; “she's not in yet. Now, sing for all  you're worth. Remember, it's for life and freedom.”    I sang “Sally in Our Alley,” not with much spirit, I am inclined to  think. With every mention of the lady's name there rose before me the  abundant form and features of my _fiancee_, which checked the feeling  that should have trembled through my voice. But Jarman, though not  enthusiastic, was content.    “It isn't what I call a grand opera voice,” he commented, “but it ought  to do all right for a chorus where economy is the chief point to be  considered. Now, I'll tell you what to do. You go to-morrow straight to  the O'Kelly, and put the whole thing before 'im. 'E's a good sort; 'e'll  touch you up a bit, and maybe give you a few introductions. Lucky for  you, this is just the right time. There's one or two things comin'  on, and if Fate ain't dead against you, you'll lose your amorita, or  whatever it's called, and not find 'er again till it's too late.”    I was not in the mood that evening to feel hopeful about anything; but I  thanked both of them for their kind intentions and promised to think  the suggestion over on the morrow, when, as it was generally agreed, I  should be in a more fitting state to bring cool judgment to bear upon  the subject; and they rose to take their departure.    Leaving Minikin to descend alone, Jarman returned the next minute.  “Consols are down a bit this week,” he whispered, with the door in his  hand. “If you want a little of the ready to carry you through, don't  go sellin' out. I can manage a few pounds. Suck a couple of lemons and  you'll be all right in the morning. So long.”    I followed his advice regarding the lemons, and finding it correct, went  to the office next morning as usual. Lott &amp; Co., in consideration of my  agreeing to a deduction of two shillings on the week's salary, allowed  himself to overlook the matter. I had intended acting on Jarman's  advice, to call upon the O'Kelly at his address of respectability in  Hampstead that evening, and had posted him a note saying I was coming.  Before leaving the office, however, I received a reply to the effect  that he would be out that evening, and asking me to make it the  following Friday instead. Disappointed, I returned to my lodgings in a  depressed state of mind. Jarman 's scheme, which had appeared hopeful  and even attractive during the daytime, now loomed shadowy and  impossible before me. The emptiness of the first floor parlour as  I passed its open door struck a chill upon me, reminding me of the  disappearance of a friend to whom, in spite of moral disapproval, I had  during these last few months become attached. Unable to work, the old  pain of loneliness returned upon me. I sat for awhile in the darkness,  listening to the scratching of the pen of my neighbour, the old  law-writer, and the sense of despair that its sound always communicated  to me encompassed me about this evening with heavier weight than usual.    After all, was not the sympathy of the Lady 'Ortensia, stimulated for  personal purposes though it might be, better than nothing? At least,  here was some living creature to whom I belonged, to whom my existence  or nonexistence was of interest, who, if only for her own sake, was  bound to share my hopes, my fears.    It was in this mood that I heard a slight tap at the door. In the dim  passage stood the small slavey, holding out a note. I took it, and  returning, lighted my candle. The envelope was pink and scented. It was  addressed, in handwriting not so bad as I had expected, to “Paul Kelver,  Esquire.” I opened it and read:    “Dr mr. Paul--I herd as how you was took hill hafter the party. I feer  you are not strong. You must not work so hard or you will be hill and  then I shall be very cros with you. I hop you are well now. If so I am  going for a wark and you may come with me if you are good. With much  love. From your affechonat ROSIE.”    In spite of the spelling, a curious, tingling sensation stole over me  as I read this my first love-letter. A faint mist swam before my eyes.  Through it, glorified and softened, I saw the face of my betrothed,  pasty yet alluring, her large white fleshy arms stretched out invitingly  toward me. Moved by a sudden hot haste that seized me, I dressed myself  with trembling hands; I appeared to be anxious to act without giving  myself time for thought. Complete, with a colour in my cheeks unusual to  them, and a burning in my eyes, I descended and knocked with a nervous  hand at the door of the second floor back.    “Who's that?” came in answer Miss Sellars' sharp tones.    “It is I--Paul.”    “Oh, wait a minute, dear.” The tone was sweeter. There followed the  sound of scurried footsteps, a rustling of clothes, a banging of  drawers, a few moments' dead silence, and then:    “You can come in now, dear.”    I entered. It was a small, untidy room, smelling of smoky lamp; but all  I saw distinctly at the moment was Miss Sellars with her arms above her  head, pinning her hat upon her straw-coloured hair.    With the sight of her before me in the flesh, my feelings underwent a  sudden revulsion. During the few minutes she had kept me waiting outside  the door I had suffered from an almost uncontrollable desire to turn the  handle and rush in. Now, had I acted on impulse, I should have run out.  Not that she was an unpleasant-looking girl by any means; it was the  atmosphere of coarseness, of commonness, around her that repelled me.  The fastidiousness--finikinness; if you will--that would so often spoil  my rare chop, put before me by a waitress with dirty finger-nails,  forced me to disregard the ample charms she no doubt did possess, to  fasten my eyes exclusively upon her red, rough hands and the one or two  warts that grew thereon.    “You're a very naughty boy,” told me Miss Sellars, finishing the  fastening of her hat. “Why didn't you come in and see me in the  dinner-_h_our? I've a great mind not to kiss you.”    The powder she had evidently dabbed on hastily was plainly visible upon  her face; the round, soft arms were hidden beneath ill-fitting sleeves  of some crapey material, the thought of which put my teeth on edge. I  wished her intention had been stronger. Instead, relenting, she  offered me her flowery cheek, which I saluted gingerly, the taste of it  reminding me of certain pale, thin dough-cakes manufactured by the wife  of our school porter and sold to us in playtime at four a penny, and  which, having regard to their satisfying quality, had been popular with  me in those days.    At the top of the kitchen stairs Miss Sellars paused and called down  shrilly to Mrs. Peedles, who in course of time appeared, panting.    “Oh, me and Mr. Kelver are going out for a short walk, Mrs. Peedles. I  shan't want any supper. Good night.”    “Oh, good night, my dear,” replied Mrs. Peedles. “Hope you'll enjoy  yourselves. Is Mr. Kelver there?”    “He's round the corner,” I heard Miss Sellars explain in a lower voice;  and there followed a snigger.    “He's a bit shy, ain't he?” suggested Mrs. Peedles in a whisper.    “I've had enough of the other sort,” was Miss Sellars' answer in low  tones.    “Ah, well; it's the shy ones that come out the strongest after a  bit--leastways, that's been my experience.”    “He'll do all right. So long.”    Miss Sellars, buttoning a burst glove, rejoined me.    “I suppose you've never had a sweetheart before?” asked Miss Sellars, as  we turned into the Blackfriars Road.    I admitted that this was my first experience.    “I can't a-bear a flirty man,” explained Miss Sellars. “That's why I  took to you from the beginning. You was so quiet.”    I began to wish that nature had bestowed upon me a noisier temperament.    “Anybody could see you was a gentleman,” continued Miss Sellars. “Heaps  and heaps of hoffers I've had--_h_undreds you might almost say. But what  I've always told 'em is, 'I like you very much indeed as a friend, but  I'm not going to marry any one but a gentleman.' Don't you think I was  right?”    I murmured it was only what I should have expected of her.    “You may take my harm, if you like,” suggested Miss Sellars, as we  crossed St. George's Circus; and linked, we pursued our way along the  Kennington Park Road.    Fortunately, there was not much need for me to talk. Miss Sellars was  content to supply most of the conversation herself, and all of it was  about herself.    I learned that her instincts since childhood had been toward gentility.  Nor was this to be wondered at, seeing that her family--on her mother's  side, at all events,--were connected distinctly with “the _h_ighest in  the land.” _Mesalliances_, however, are common in all communities, and  one of them, a particularly flagrant specimen--her “Mar” had, alas!  contracted, having married--what did I think? I should never guess--a  waiter! Miss Sellars, stopping in the act of crossing Newington Butts to  shudder at the recollection of her female parent's shame, was nearly run  down by a tramcar.    Mr. and Mrs. Sellars did not appear to have “hit it off” together. Could  one wonder: Mrs. Sellars with an uncle on the Stock Exchange, and Mr.  Sellars with one on Peckham Rye? I gathered his calling to have been,  chiefly, “three shies a penny.” Mrs. Sellars was now, however, happily  dead; and if no other good thing had come out of the catastrophe, it had  determined Miss Sellars to take warning by her mother's error and avoid  connection with the lowly born. She it was who, with my help, would lift  the family back again to its proper position in society.    “It used to be a joke against me,” explained Miss Sellars, “heven when  I was quite a child. I never could tolerate anything low. Why, one day  when I was only seven years old, what do you think happened?”    I confessed my inability to guess.    “Well, I'll tell you,” said Miss Sellars; “it'll just show you. Uncle  Joseph--that was father's uncle, you understand?”    I assured Miss Sellars that the point was fixed in my mind.    “Well, one day when he came to see us he takes a cocoanut out of his  pocket and offers it to me. 'Thank you,' I says; 'I don't heat cocoanuts  that have been shied at by just anybody and missed!' It made him so  wild. After that,” explained Miss Sellars, “they used to call me at home  the Princess of Wales.”    I murmured it was a pretty fancy.    “Some people,” replied Miss Sellars, with a giggle, “says it fits me;  but, of course, that's only their nonsense.”    Not knowing what to reply, I remained silent, which appeared to somewhat  disappoint Miss Sellars.    Out of the Clapham Road we turned into a by-street of two-storeyed  houses.    “You'll come in and have a bit of supper?” suggested Miss Sellars.  “Mar's quite hanxious to see you.”    I found sufficient courage to say I was not feeling well, and would much  rather return home.    “Oh, but you must just come in for five minutes, dear. It'll look so  funny if you don't. I told 'em we was coming.”    “I would really rather not,” I urged; “some other evening.” I felt  a presentiment, I confided to her, that on this particular evening I  should not shine to advantage.    “Oh, you mustn't be so shy,” said Miss Sellars. “I don't like shy  fellows--not too shy. That's silly.” And Miss Sellars took my arm with  a decided grip, making it clear to me that escape could be obtained only  by an unseemly struggle in the street; not being prepared for which, I  meekly yielded.    We knocked at the door of one of the small houses, Miss Sellars  retaining her hold upon me until it had been opened to us by a lank  young man in his shirt-sleeves and closed behind us.    “Don't gentlemen wear coats of a hevening nowadays?” asked Miss Sellars,  tartly, of the lank young man. “New fashion just come in?”    “I don't know what gentlemen wear in the evening or what they don't,”   retorted the lank young man, who appeared to be in an aggressive mood.  “If I can find one in this street, I'll ast him and let you know.”    “Mother in the droaring-room?” enquired Miss Sellars, ignoring the  retort.    “They're all of 'em in the parlour, if that's what you mean,” returned  the lank young man, “the whole blooming shoot. If you stand up against  the wall and don't breathe, there'll just be room for you.”    Sweeping by the lank young man, Miss Sellars opened the parlour door,  and towing me in behind her, shut it.    “Well, Mar, here we are,” announced Miss Sellars. An enormously stout  lady, ornamented with a cap that appeared to have been made out of a  bandanna handkerchief, rose to greet us, thus revealing the fact  that she had been sitting upon an extremely small horsehair-covered  easy-chair, the disproportion between the lady and her support being  quite pathetic.    “I am charmed, Mr.--”    “Kelver,” supplied Miss Sellars.    “Kelver, to make your ac-quain-tance,” recited Mrs. Sellars in the tone  of one repeating a lesson.    I bowed, and murmured that the honour was entirely mine.    “Don't mention it,” replied Mrs. Sellars. “Pray be seated.”    Mrs. Sellars herself set the example by suddenly giving way and dropping  down into her chair, which thus again became invisible. It received her  with an agonised groan.    Indeed, the insistence with which this article of furniture throughout  the evening called attention to its sufferings was really quite  distracting. With every breath that Mrs. Sellars took it moaned wearily.  There were moments when it literally shrieked. I could not have accepted  Mrs. Sellars' offer had I wished, there being no chair vacant and no  room for another. A young man with watery eyes, sitting just behind me  between a fat young lady and a lean one, rose and suggested my taking  his place. Miss Sellars introduced me to him as her cousin Joseph  something or other, and we shook hands.    The watery-eyed Joseph remarked that it had been a fine day between  the showers, and hoped that the morrow would be either wet or dry; upon  which the lean young lady, having slapped him, asked admiringly of the  fat young lady if he wasn't a “silly fool;” to which the fat young lady  replied, with somewhat unnecessary severity, I thought, that no one  could help being what they were born. To this the lean young lady  retorted that it was with precisely similar reflection that she herself  controlled her own feelings when tempted to resent the fat young lady's  “nasty jealous temper.”    The threatened quarrel was nipped in the bud by the discretion of Miss  Sellars, who took the opportunity of the fat young lady's momentary  speechlessness to introduce me promptly to both of them. They also,  I learned, were cousins. The lean girl said she had “erd on me,” and  immediately fell into an uncontrollable fit of giggles; of which the  watery-eyed Joseph requested me to take no notice, explaining that she  always went off like that at exactly three-quarters to the half-hour  every evening, Sundays and holidays excepted; that she had taken  everything possible for it without effect, and that what he himself  advised was that she should have it off.    The fat girl, seizing the chance afforded her, remarked genteelly that  she too had “heard hof me,” with emphasis upon the “hof.” She also  remarked it was a long walk from Blackfriars Bridge.    “All depends upon the company, eh? Bet they didn't find it too long.”    This came from a loud-voiced, red-faced man sitting on the sofa beside a  somewhat melancholy-looking female dressed in bright green. These twain  I discovered to be Uncle and Aunt Gutton. From an observation dropped  later in the evening concerning government restrictions on the sale of  methylated spirit, and hastily smothered, I gathered that their line was  oil and colour.    Mr. Gutton's forte appeared to be badinage. He it was who, on my  explaining my heightened colour as due to the closeness of the evening,  congratulated his niece on having secured so warm a partner.    “Will be jolly handy,” shouted Uncle Gutton, “for Rosina, seeing she's  always complaining of her cold feet.”    Here the lank young man attempted to squeeze himself into the room, but  found his entrance barred by the square, squat figure of the watery-eyed  young man.    “Don't push,” advised the watery-eyed young man. “Walk over me quietly.”    “Well, why don't yer get out of the way,” growled the lank young man,  now coated, but still aggressive.    “Where am I to get to?” asked the watery-eyed young man, with some  reason. “Say the word and I'll 'ang myself up to the gas bracket.”    “In my courting days,” roared Uncle Gutton, “the girls used to be able  to find seats, even if there wasn't enough chairs to go all round.”    The sentiment was received with varying degrees of approbation. The  watery-eyed young man, sitting down, put the lean young lady on his  knee, and in spite of her struggles and sounding slaps, heroically  retained her there.    “Now, then, Rosie,” shouted Uncle Gutton, who appeared to have  constituted himself master of the ceremonies, “don't stand about, my  girl; you'll get tired.”    Left to herself, I am inclined to think my _fiancee_ would have spared  me; but Uncle Gutton, having been invited to a love comedy, was not  to be cheated of any part of the performance, and the audience clearly  being with him, there was nothing for it but compliance. I seated  myself, and amid plaudits accommodated the ample and heavy Rosina upon  my knee.    “Good-bye,” called out to me the watery-eyed young man, as behind the  fair Rosina I disappeared from his view. “See you again later on.”    “I used to be a plump girl myself before I married,” observed Aunt  Gutton. “Plump as butter I was at one time.”    “It isn't what one eats,” said the maternal Sellars. “I myself don't eat  enough to keep a fly, and my legs--”    “That'll do, Mar,” interrupted the filial Sellars, tartly.    “I was only going to say, my dear--”    “We all know what you was going to say, Mar,” retorted Miss Sellars.  “We've heard it before, and it isn't interesting.”    Mrs. Sellars relapsed into silence.    “'Ard work and plenty of it keeps you thin enough, I notice,” remarked  the lank young man, with bitterness. To him I was now introduced, he  being Mr. George Sellars. “Seen 'im before,” was his curt greeting.    At supper--referred to by Mrs. Sellars again in the tone of one  remembering a lesson, as a cold col-la-tion, with the accent on the  “tion”--I sat between Miss Sellars and the lean young lady, with Aunt  and Uncle Gutton opposite to us. It was remarked with approval that I  did not appear to be hungry.    “Had too many kisses afore he started,” suggested Uncle Gutton, with  his mouth full of cold roast pork and pickles. “Wonderfully nourishing  thing, kisses, eh? Look at mother and me. That's all we live on.”    Aunt Gutton sighed, and observed that she had always been a poor feeder.    The watery-eyed young man, observing he had never tasted them  himself--at which sally there was much laughter--said he would not mind  trying a sample if the lean young lady would kindly pass him one.    The lean young lady opined that, not being used to high living, it might  disagree with him.    “Just one,” pleaded the watery-eyed young man, “to go with this bit of  cracklin'.”    The lean young lady, amid renewed applause, first thoughtfully wiping  her mouth, acceded to his request.    The watery-eyed young man turned it over with the air of a gourmet.    “Not bad,” was his verdict. “Reminds me of onions.” At this there was  another burst of laughter.    “Now then, ain't Paul goin' to have one?” shouted Uncle Gutton, when the  laughter had subsided.    Amid silence, feeling as wretched as perhaps I have ever felt in my life  before or since, I received one from the gracious Miss Sellars, wet and  sounding.    “Looks better for it already,” commented the delighted Uncle Gutton.  “He'll soon get fat on 'em.”    “Not too many at first,” advised the watery-eyed young man. “Looks to me  as if he's got a weak stomach.”    I think, had the meal lasted much longer, I should have made a dash for  the street; the contemplation of such step was forming in my mind. But  Miss Sellars, looking at her watch, declared we must be getting home at  once, for the which I could have kissed her voluntarily; and, being a  young lady of decision, at once rose and commenced leave-taking. Polite  protests were attempted, but these, with enthusiastic assistance from  myself, she swept aside.    “Don't want any one to walk home with you?” suggested Uncle Gutton.  “Sure you won't feel lonely by yourselves, eh?”    “We shan't come to no harm,” assured him Miss Sellars.    “P'raps you're right,” agreed Uncle Gutton. “There don't seem to be much  of the fiery and untamed about him, so far as I can see.”    “'Slow waters run deep,'” reminded us Aunt Gutton, with a waggish shake  of her head.    “No question about the slow,” assented Uncle Gutton. “If you don't like  him--” observed Miss Sellars, speaking with dignity.    “To be quite candid with you, my girl, I don't,” answered Uncle Gutton,  whose temper, maybe as the result of too much cold pork and whiskey,  seemed to have suddenly changed.    “Well, he happens to be good enough for me,” recommenced Miss Sellars.    “I'm sorry to hear a niece of mine say so,” interrupted Uncle Gutton.  “If you want my opinion of him--”    “If ever I do I'll call round some time when you're sober and ast you  for it,” returned Miss Sellars. “And as for being your niece, you was  here when I came, and I don't see very well as how I could have got out  of it. You needn't throw that in my teeth.”    The gust was dispersed by the practical remark of brother George to the  effect that the last tram for Walworth left the Oval at eleven-thirty;  to which he further added the suggestion that the Clapham Road was wide  and well adapted to a row.    “There ain't going to be no rows,” replied Uncle Gutton, returning to  amiability as suddenly as he had departed from it. “We understand each  other, don't we, my girl?”    “That's all right, uncle. I know what you mean,” returned Miss Sellars,  with equal handsomeness.    “Bring him round again when he's feeling better,” added Uncle Gutton,  “and we'll have another look at him.”    “What you want,” advised the watery-eyed young man on shaking hands with  me, “is complete rest and a tombstone.”    I wished at the time I could have followed his prescription.    The maternal Sellars waddled after us into the passage, which she  completely blocked. She told me she was delight-ted to have met me, and  that she was always at home on Sundays.    I said I would remember it, and thanked her warmly for a pleasant  evening, at Miss Sellars' request calling her Ma.    Outside, Miss Sellars agreed that my presentiment had proved  correct--that I had not shone to advantage. Our journey home on a  tramcar was a somewhat silent proceeding. At the door of her room she  forgave me, and kissed me good night. Had I been frank with her, I  should have thanked her for that evening's experience. It had made my  course plain to me.    The next day, which was Thursday, I wandered about the streets till two  o'clock in the morning, when I slipped in quietly, passing Miss Sellars'  door with my boots in my hand.    After Mr. Lott's departure on Friday, which, fortunately, was pay-day,  I set my desk in order and confided to Minikin written instructions  concerning all matters unfinished.    “I shall not be here to-morrow,” I told him. “Going to follow your  advice.”    “Found anything to do?” he asked.    “Not yet,” I answered.    “Suppose you can't get anything?”    “If the worst comes to the worst,” I replied, “I can hang myself.”    “Well, you know the girl. Maybe you are right,” he agreed.    “Hope it won't throw much extra work on you,” I said.    “Well, I shan't be catching it if it does,” was his answer. “That's all  right.”    He walked with me to the “Angel,” and there we parted.    “If you do get on to the stage,” he said, “and it's anything worth  seeing, and you send me an order, and I can find the time, maybe I'll  come and see you.”    I thanked him for his promised support and jumped upon the tram.    The O'Kelly's address was in Belsize Square. I was about to ring and  knock, as requested by a highly-polished brass plate, when I became  aware of pieces of small coal falling about me on the doorstep. Looking  up, I perceived the O'Kelly leaning out of an attic window. From signs  I gathered I was to retire from the doorstep and wait. In a few minutes  the door opened and his hand beckoned me to enter.    “Walk quietly,” he whispered; and on tip-toe we climbed up to the attic  from where had fallen the coal. “I've been waiting for ye,” explained  the O'Kelly, speaking low. “Me wife--a good woman, Paul; sure, a better  woman never lived; ye'll like her when ye know her, later on--she might  not care about ye're calling. She'd want to know where I met ye, and--ye  understand? Besides,” added the O'Kelly, “we can smoke up here;” and  seating himself where he could keep an eye upon the door, near to a  small cupboard out of which he produced a pipe still alight, the O'Kelly  prepared himself to listen.    I told him briefly the reason of my visit.    “It was my fault, Paul,” he was good enough to say; “my fault entirely.  Between ourselves, it was a damned silly idea, that party, the whole  thing altogether. Don't ye think so?”    I replied that I was naturally prejudiced against it myself.    “Most unfortunate for me,” continued the O'Kelly; “I know that. Me  cabman took me to Hammersmith instead of Hampstead; said I told him  Hammersmith. Didn't get home here till three o'clock in the morning.  Most unfortunate--under the circumstances.”    I could quite imagine it.    “But I'm glad ye've come,” said the O'Kelly. “I had a notion ye did  something foolish that evening, but I couldn't remember precisely what.  It's been worrying me.”    “It's been worrying me also, I can assure you,” I told him; and I gave  him an account of my Wednesday evening's experience.    “I'll go round to-morrow morning,” he said, “and see one or two people.  It's not a bad idea, that of Jarman's. I think I may be able to arrange  something for ye.”    He fixed a time for me to call again upon him the next day, when Mrs.  O'Kelly would be away from home. He instructed me to walk quietly up and  down on the opposite side of the road with my eye on the attic window,  and not to come across unless he waved a handkerchief.    Rising to go, I thanked him for his kindness. “Don't put it that way, me  dear Paul,” he answered. “If I don't get ye out of this scrape I shall  never forgive meself. If we damned silly fools don't help one another,”   he added, with his pleasant laugh, “who is to help us?”    We crept downstairs as we had crept up. As we reached the first floor,  the drawing-room door suddenly opened.    “William!” cried a sharp voice.    “Me dear,” answered the O'Kelly, snatching his pipe from his mouth and  thrusting it, still alight, into his trousers pocket. I made the rest  of the descent by myself, and slipping out, closed the door behind me as  noiselessly as possible.    Again I did not return to Nelson Square until the early hours, and the  next morning did not venture out until I had heard Miss Sellars, who  appeared to be in a bad temper, leave the house. Then running to the top  of the kitchen stairs, I called for Mrs. Peedles. I told her I was going  to leave her, and, judging the truth to be the simplest explanation, I  told her the reason why.    “My dear,” said Mrs. Peedles, “I am only too glad to hear it. It wasn't  for me to interfere, but I couldn't help seeing you were making a fool  of yourself. I only hope you'll get clear off, and you may depend upon  me to do all I can to help you.”    “You don't think I'm acting dishonourably, do you, Mrs. Peedles?” I  asked.    “My dear,” replied Mrs. Peedles, “it's a difficult world to live  in--leastways, that's been my experience of it.”    I had just completed my packing--it had not taken me long--when I  heard upon the stairs the heavy panting that always announced to me the  up-coming of Mrs. Peedles. She entered with a bundle of old manuscripts  under her arm, torn and tumbled booklets of various shapes and sizes.  These she plumped down upon the rickety table, and herself upon the  nearest chair.    “Put them in your box, my dear,” said Mrs. Peedles. “They'll come in  useful to you later on.”    I glanced at the bundle. I saw it was a collection of old plays in  manuscript-prompt copies, scored, cut and interlined. The top one I  noticed was “The Bloodspot: Or the Maiden, the Miser and the Murderer;”   the second, “The Female Highwayman.”    “Everybody's forgotten 'em,” explained Mrs. Peedles, “but there's some  good stuff in all of them.”    “But what am I to do with them?” I enquired.    “Just whatever you like, my dear,” explained Mrs. Peedles. “It's quite  safe. They're all of 'em dead, the authors of 'em. I've picked 'em out  most carefully. You just take a scene from one and a scene from the  other. With judgment and your talent you'll make a dozen good plays out  of that little lot when your time comes.”    “But they wouldn't be my plays, Mrs. Peedles,” I suggested.    “They will if I give them to you,” answered Mrs. Peedles. “You put 'em  in your box. And never mind the bit of rent,” added Mrs. Peedles; “you  can pay me that later on.”    I kissed the kind old soul good-bye and took her gift with me to my new  lodgings in Camden Town. Many a time have I been hard put to it for  plot or scene, and more than once in weak mood have I turned with guilty  intent the torn and crumpled pages of Mrs. Peedles's donation to my  literary equipment. It is pleasant to be able to put my hand upon my  heart and reflect that never yet have I yielded to the temptation.  Always have I laid them back within their drawer, saying to myself, with  stern reproof:    “No, no, Paul. Stand or fall by your own merits. Never plagiarise--in  any case, not from this 'little lot.'”        CHAPTER IV.    LEADS TO A MEETING.    “Don't be nervous,” said the O'Kelly, “and don't try to do too much. You  have a very fair voice, but it's not powerful. Keep cool and open your  mouth.”    It was eleven o'clock in the morning. We were standing at the entrance  of the narrow court leading to the stage door. For a fortnight past the  O'Kelly had been coaching me. It had been nervous work for both of us,  but especially for the O'Kelly. Mrs. O'Kelly, a thin, acid-looking lady,  of whom I once or twice had caught a glimpse while promenading Belsize  Square awaiting the O'Kelly's signal, was a serious-minded lady, with a  conscientious objection to all music not of a sacred character. With the  hope of winning the O'Kelly from one at least of his sinful tendencies,  the piano had been got rid of, and its place in the drawing-room filled  by an American organ of exceptionally lugubrious tone. With this we  had had to make shift, and though the O'Kelly--a veritable musical  genius--had succeeded in evolving from it an accompaniment to “Sally in  Our Alley” less misleading and confusing than might otherwise have been  the case, the result had not been to lighten our labours. My rendering  of the famous ballad had, in consequence, acquired a dolefulness not  intended by the composer. Sung as I sang it, the theme became, to employ  a definition since grown hackneyed as applied to Art, a problem ballad.  Involuntarily one wondered whether the marriage would turn out as  satisfactorily as the young man appeared to anticipate. Was there not,  when one came to think of it, a melancholy, a pessimism ingrained within  the temperament of the complainful hero that would ill assort with  those instincts toward frivolity the careful observer could not avoid  discerning in the charming yet nevertheless somewhat shallow character  of Sally.    “Lighter, lighter. Not so soulful,” would demand the O'Kelly, as the  solemn notes rolled jerkily from the groaning instrument beneath his  hands.    Once we were nearly caught, Mrs. O'Kelly returning from a district  visitors' committee meeting earlier than was expected. Hastily I was  hidden in a small conservatory adjutting from the first floor landing,  where, crouching behind flower-pots, I listened in fear and trembling to  the severe cross-examination of the O'Kelly.    “William, do not prevaricate. It was not a hymn.”    “Me dear, so much depends upon the time. Let me give ye an example of  what I mean.”    “William, pray in my presence not to play tricks with sacred melodies.  If you have no respect for religion, please remember that I have.  Besides, why should you be playing hymns in any time at ten o'clock  in the morning? It is not like you, William, and I do not credit your  explanation. And you were singing. I distinctly heard the word 'Sally'  as I opened the door.”    “Salvation, me dear,” corrected the O'Kelly.    “Your enunciation, William, is not usually so much at fault.”    “A little hoarseness, me dear,” explained the O'Kelly.    “Your voice did not sound hoarse. Perhaps it will be better if we do not  pursue the subject further.”    With this the O'Kelly appeared to agree.    “A lady a little difficult to get on with when ye're feeling well and  strong,” so the O'Kelly would explain her; “but if ye happen to be ill,  one of the kindest, most devoted of women. When I was down with typhoid  three years ago, a tenderer nurse no man could have had. I shall never  forget it. And so she would be again to-morrow, if there was anything  serious the matter with me.”    I murmured the well-known quotation.    “Mrs. O'Kelly to a T,” concurred the O'Kelly. “I sometimes wonder if  Lady Scott may not have been the same sort of woman.”    “The unfortunate part of it is,” continued the O'Kelly, “that I'm such  a healthy beggar; it don't give her a chance. If I were only a chronic  invalid, now, there's nothing that woman would not do to make me happy.  As it is--” The O'Kelly struck a chord. We resumed our studies.    But to return to our conversation at the stage door.    “Meet me at the Cheshire Cheese at one o'clock,” said the O'Kelly,  shaking hands. “If ye don't get on here, we'll try something else; but  I've spoken to Hodgson, and I think ye will. Good luck to ye!”    He went his way and I mine. In a glass box just behind the door a  curved-nose, round-eyed little man, looking like an angry bird in a  cage, demanded of me my business. I showed him my letter of appointment.    “Up the passage, across the stage, along the corridor, first floor,  second door on the right,” he instructed me in one breath, and shut the  window with a snap.    I proceeded up the passage. It somewhat surprised me to discover that  I was not in the least excited at the thought of this, my first  introduction to “behind the scenes.”    I recall my father's asking a young soldier on his return from the  Crimea what had been his sensations at the commencement of his first  charge.    “Well,” replied the young fellow, “I was worrying all the time,  remembering I had rushed out leaving the beer tap running in the  canteen, and I could not forget it.”    So far as the stage I found my way in safety. Pausing for a moment and  glancing round, my impression was not so much disillusionment concerning  all things theatrical as realisation of my worst forebodings. In that  one moment all glamour connected with the stage fell from me, nor has it  since ever returned to me. From the tawdry decorations of the auditorium  to the childish make-belief littered around on the stage, I saw the  Theatre a painted thing of shreds and patches--the grown child's  doll's-house. The Drama may improve us, elevate us, interest and teach  us. I am sure it does; long may it flourish! But so likewise does the  dressing and undressing of dolls, the opening of the front of the house,  and the tenderly putting of them away to bed in rooms they completely  fill, train our little dears to the duties and the joys of motherhood.  Toys! what wise child despises them? Art, fiction, the musical glasses:  are they not preparing us for the time, however distant, when we shall  at last be grown up?    In a maze of ways beyond the stage I lost myself, but eventually, guided  by voices, came to a large room furnished barely with many chairs  and worn settees, and here I found some twenty to thirty ladies  and gentlemen already seated. They were of varying ages, sizes  and appearance, but all of them alike in having about them that  impossible-to-define but impossible-to-mistake suggestion of  theatricality. The men were chiefly remarkable for having no hair on  their faces, but a good deal upon their heads; the ladies, one and  all, were blessed with remarkably pink and white complexions and  exceptionally bright eyes. The conversation, carried on in subdued but  penetrating voices, was chiefly of “him” and “her.” Everybody appeared  to be on an affectionate footing with everybody else, the terms of  address being “My dear,” “My love,” “Old girl,” “Old chappie,” Christian  names--when name of any sort was needful--alone being employed. I  hesitated for a minute with the door in my hand, fearing I had stumbled  upon a family gathering. As, however, nobody seemed disconcerted at my  entry, I ventured to take a vacant seat next to an extremely small and  boyish-looking gentleman and to ask him if this was the room in which I,  an applicant for a place in the chorus of the forthcoming comic opera,  ought to be waiting.    He had large, fishy eyes, with which he looked me up and down. For such  a length of time he remained thus regarding me in silence that a massive  gentleman sitting near, who had overheard, took it upon himself to reply  in the affirmative, adding that from what he knew of Butterworth we  would all of us be waiting here a damned sight longer than any gentleman  should keep other ladies and gentlemen waiting for no reason at all.    “I think it exceedingly bad form,” observed the fishy-eyed gentleman,  in deep contralto tones, “for any gentleman to take it upon himself to  reply to a remark addressed to quite another gentleman.”    “I beg your pardon,” retorted the large gentleman. “I thought you were  asleep.”    “I think it very ill manners,” remarked the small gentlemen in the same  slow and impressive tones, “for any gentleman to tell another gentleman,  who happens to be wide awake, that he thought he was asleep.”    “Sir,” returned the massive gentleman, assuming with the help of a large  umbrella a quite Johnsonian attitude, “I decline to alter my manners to  suit your taste.”    “If you are satisfied with them,” replied the small gentleman, “I cannot  help it. But I think you are making a mistake.”    “Does anybody know what the opera is about?” asked a bright little woman  at the other end of the room.    “Does anybody ever know what a comic opera is about?” asked another  lady, whose appearance suggested experience.    “I once asked the author,” observed a weary-looking gentleman, speaking  from a corner. “His reply was: 'Well, if you had asked me at the  beginning of the rehearsals I might have been able to tell you, but  damned if I could now!'”    “It wouldn't surprise me,” observed a good-looking gentleman in a velvet  coat, “if there occurred somewhere in the proceedings a drinking chorus  for male voices.”    “Possibly, if we are good,” added a thin lady with golden hair, “the  heroine will confide to us her love troubles, which will interest us and  excite us.”    The door at the further end of the room opened and a name was called.  An elderly lady rose and went out.    “Poor old Gertie!” remarked sympathetically the thin lady with the  golden hair. “I'm told that she really had a voice once.”    “When poor young Bond first came to London,” said the massive gentleman  who was sitting on my left, “I remember his telling me he applied to  Lord Barrymore's 'tiger,' Alexander Lee, I mean, of course, who was then  running the Strand Theatre, for a place in the chorus. Lee heard him  sing two lines, and then jumped up. 'Thanks, that'll do; good morning,'  says Lee. Bond knew he had got a good voice, so he asked Lee what was  wrong. 'What's wrong?' shouts Lee. 'Do you think I hire a chorus to show  up my principals?'”    “Having regard to the company present,” commented the fishy-eyed  gentleman, “I consider that anecdote as distinctly lacking in tact.”    The feeling of the company appeared to be with the fish-eyed young man.    For the next half hour the door at the further end of the room continued  to open and close, devouring, ogre-fashion, each time some dainty human  morsel, now chorus gentleman, now chorus lady. Conversation among our  thinning ranks became more fitful, a growing anxiety making for silence.    At length, “Mr. Horace Moncrieff” called the voice of the unseen Charon.  In common with the rest, I glanced round languidly to see what sort of  man “Mr. Horace Moncrieff” might be. The door was pushed open further.  Charon, now revealed as a pale-faced young man with a drooping  moustache, put his head into the room and repeated impatiently his  invitation to the apparently coy Moncrieff. It suddenly occurred to me  that I was Mr. Horace Moncrieff.    “So glad you've found yourself,” said the pale-faced young man, as I  joined him at the door. “Please don't lose yourself again; we're rather  pressed for time.”    I crossed with him through a deserted refreshment bar--one of the  saddest of sights--into a room beyond. A melancholy-looking gentleman  was seated at the piano. Beside him stood a tall, handsome man, who  was opening and reading rapidly from a bundle of letters he held in his  hand. A big, burly, bored-looking gentleman was making desperate  efforts to be amused at the staccato conversation of a sharp-faced,  restless-eyed gentleman, whose peculiarity was that he never by any  chance looked at the person to whom he was talking, but always at  something or somebody else.    “Moncrieff?” enquired the tall, handsome man--whom I later discovered to  be Mr. Hodgson, the manager--without raising his eyes from his letters.    The pale-faced gentleman responded for me.    “Fire away,” said Mr. Hodgson.    “What is it?” asked of me wearily the melancholy gentleman at the piano.    “'Sally in Our Alley,'” I replied.    “What are you?” interrupted Mr. Hodgson. He had never once looked at me,  and did not now.    “A tenor,” I replied. “Not a full tenor,” I added, remembering the  O'Kelly's instructions.    “Utterly impossible to fill a tenor,” remarked the restless-eyed  gentleman, looking at me and speaking to the worried-looking gentleman.  “Ever tried?”    Everybody laughed, with the exception of the melancholy gentleman at the  piano, Mr. Hodgson throwing in his contribution without raising his eyes  from his letters. Throughout the proceedings the restless-eyed gentleman  continued to make humorous observations of this nature, at which  everybody laughed, excepting always the melancholy pianist--a short,  sharp, mechanical laugh, devoid of the least suggestion of amusement.  The restless-eyed gentleman, it appeared, was the leading low comedian  of the theatre.    “Go on,” said the melancholy gentleman, and commenced the accompaniment.    “Tell me when he's going to begin,” remarked Mr. Hodgson at the  conclusion of the first verse.    “He has a fair voice,” said my accompanist. “He's evidently nervous.”    “There is a prejudice throughout theatrical audiences,” observed Mr.  Hodgson, “in favour of a voice they can hear. That is all I am trying to  impress upon him.”    The second verse, so I imagined, I sang in the voice of a trumpet. The  burly gentleman--the translator of the French libretto, as he turned  out to be; the author of the English version, as he preferred to  be called--acknowledged to having distinctly detected a sound. The  restless-eyed comedian suggested an announcement from the stage  requesting strict silence during my part of the performance.    The sickness of fear was stealing over me. My voice, so it seemed to me,  disappointed at the effect it had produced, had retired, sulky, into my  boots, whence it refused to emerge.    “Your voice is all right--very good,” whispered the musical conductor.  “They want to hear the best you can do, that's all.”    At this my voice ran up my legs and out of my mouth. “Thirty shillings  a week, half salary for rehearsals. If that's all right, Mr. Catchpole  will give you your agreement. If not, very much obliged. Good morning,”   said Mr. Hodgson, still absorbed in his correspondence.    With the pale-faced young man I retired to a desk in the corner, where  a few seconds sufficed for the completion of the business. Leaving, I  sought to catch the eye of my melancholy friend, but he appeared too  sunk in dejection to notice anything. The restless-eyed comedian,  looking at the author of the English version and addressing me as  Boanerges, wished me good morning, at which the everybody laughed; and,  informed as to the way out by the pale-faced Mr. Catchpole, I left.    The first “call” was for the following Monday at two o'clock. I found  the theatre full of life and bustle. The principals, who had just  finished their own rehearsal, were talking together in a group. We  ladies and gentlemen of the chorus filled the centre of the stage. I  noticed the lady I had heard referred to as Gertie; as also the thin  lady with the golden hair. The massive gentleman and the fishy-eyed  young man were again in close proximity; so long as I knew them they  always were together, possessed, apparently, of a sympathetic antipathy  for each other. The fishy-eyed young gentleman was explaining the age at  which he thought decayed chorus singers ought, in justice to themselves  and the public, to retire from the profession; the massive gentleman,  the age and size at which he thought parcels of boys ought to be  learning manners across their mother's knee.    Mr. Hodgson, still reading letters exactly as I had left him four days  ago, stood close to the footlights. My friend, the musical director,  armed with a violin and supported by about a dozen other musicians,  occupied the orchestra. The adapter and the stage manager--a Frenchman  whom I found it good policy to mistake for a born Englishman--sat  deep in confabulation at a small table underneath a temporary gas jet.  Quarter of an hour or so passed by, and then the stage manager, becoming  suddenly in a hurry, rang a small bell furiously.    “Clear, please; all clear,” shouted a small boy, with important air  suggestive of a fox terrier; and, following the others, I retreated to  the wings.    The comedian and the leading lady--whom I knew well from the front,  but whom I should never have recognised--severed themselves from their  companions and joined Mr. Hodgson by the footlights. As a preliminary we  were sorted out, according to our sizes, into loving couples.    “Ah,” said the stage manager, casting an admiring gaze upon the  fishy-eyed young man, whose height might have been a little over five  feet two, “I have the very girl for you--a beauty!” Darting into the  group of ladies, he returned with quite the biggest specimen, a lady  of magnificent proportions, whom, with the air of the virtuous uncle  of melodrama, he bestowed upon the fishy-eyed young man. To the massive  gentleman was given a sharp-faced little lady, who at a distance  appeared quite girlish. Myself I found mated to the thin lady with the  golden hair.    At last complete, we took our places in the then approved semi-circle,  and the attenuated orchestra struck up the opening chorus. My music,  which had been sent me by post, I had gone over with the O'Kelly, and  about that I felt confident; but for the rest, ill at ease.    “I am afraid,” said the thin lady, “I must ask you to put your arm round  my waist. It's very shocking, I know, but, you see, our salary depends  upon it. Do you think you could manage it?”    I glanced into her face. A whimsical expression of fun replied to me and  drove away my shyness. I carried out her instructions to the best of my  ability.    The indefatigable stage manager ran in and out among us while we sang,  driving this couple back a foot or so, this other forward, herding this  group closer together, throughout another making space, suggesting the  idea of a sheep-dog at work.    “Very good, very good indeed,” commented Mr. Hodgson at the conclusion.  “We will go over it once more, and this time in tune.”    “And we will make love,” added the stage manager; “not like marionettes,  but like ladies and gentlemen all alive.” Seizing the lady nearest to  him, he explained to us by object lesson how the real peasant invariably  behaves when under influence of the grand passion, standing gracefully  with hands clasped upon heart, head inclined at an angle of forty-five,  his whole countenance eloquent with tender adoration.    “If he expects” remarked the massive gentleman _sotto voce_ to an  experienced-looking young lady, “a performance of Romeo thrown in, I,  for one, shall want an extra ten shillings a week.”    Casting the lady aside and seizing upon a gentleman, our stage manager  then proceeded to show the ladies how a village maiden should receive  affectionate advances: one shoulder a trifle higher than the other, body  from the waist upward gently waggling, roguish expression in left eye.    “Ah, he's a bit new to it,” replied the experienced young lady. “He'll  get over all that.”    Again we started. Whether others attempted to follow the stage manager's  directions I cannot say, my whole attention being centred upon the  fishy-eyed young man, who did, implicitly. Soon it became apparent that  the whole of us were watching the fishy-eyed young man to the utter  neglect of our own business. Mr. Hodgson even looked up from his  letters; the orchestra was playing out of time; the author of the  English version and the leading lady exchanged glances. Three people  only appeared not to be enjoying themselves: the chief comedian, the  stage manager and the fishy-eyed young gentleman himself, who pursued  his labours methodically and conscientiously. There was a whispered  confabulation between the leading low comedian, Mr. Hodgson and the  stage manager. As a result, the music ceased and the fishy-eyed young  gentleman was requested to explain what he was doing.    “Only making love,” replied the fishy-eyed young gentleman.    “You were playing the fool, sir,” retorted the leading low comedian,  severely.    “That is a very unkind remark,” replied the fishy-eyed young gentleman,  evidently hurt, “to make to a gentleman who is doing his best.”    Mr. Hodgson behind his letters was laughing. “Poor fellow,” he murmured;  “I suppose he can't help it. Go on.”    “We are not producing a pantomime, you know,” urged our comedian.    “I want to give him a chance, poor devil,” explained Mr. Hodgson in a  lower voice. “Only support of a widowed mother.”    Our comedian appeared inclined to argue; but at this point Mr. Hodgson's  correspondence became absorbing.    For the chorus the second act was a busy one. We opened as soldiers  and vivandieres, every warrior in this way possessing his own private  travelling bar. Our stage manager again explained to us by example how  a soldier behaves, first under stress of patriotic emotion, and secondly  under stress of cheap cognac, the difference being somewhat subtle:  patriotism displaying itself by slaps upon the chest, and cheap cognac  by slaps upon the forehead. A little later we were conspirators; our  stage manager, with the help of a tablecloth, showed us how to conspire.  Next we were a mob, led by the sentimental baritone; our stage manager,  ruffling his hair, expounded to us how a mob led by a sentimental  baritone would naturally behave itself. The act wound up with a fight.  Our stage manager, minus his coat, demonstrated to us how to fight and  die, the dying being a painful and dusty performance, necessitating, as  it did, much rolling about on the stage. The fishy-eyed young gentleman  throughout the whole of it was again the centre of attraction. Whether  he were solemnly slapping his chest and singing about glory, or solemnly  patting his head and singing about grapes, was immaterial: he was the  soldier for us. What the plot was about did not matter, so long as he  was in it. Who led the mob one did not care; one's desire was to see  him lead. How others fought and died was matter of no moment; to see him  slaughtered was sufficient. Whether his unconsciousness was assumed or  natural I cannot say; in either case it was admirable. An earnest young  man, over-anxious, if anything, to do his duty by his employers, was  the extent of the charge that could be brought against him. Our chief  comedian frowned and fumed; our stage manager was in despair. Mr.  Hodgson and the author of the English version, on the contrary, appeared  kindly disposed towards the gentleman. In addition to the widowed  mother, Mr. Hodgson had invented for him five younger brothers and  sisters utterly destitute but for his earnings. To deprive so exemplary  a son and brother of the means of earning a livelihood for dear ones  dependent upon him was not in Mr. Hodgson's heart. Our chief comedian  dissociated himself from all uncharitable feelings--would subscribe  towards the subsistence of the young man out of his own pocket, his  only concern being the success of the opera. The author of the English  version was convinced the young man would not accept a charity; had  known him for years--was a most sensitive creature.    The rehearsal proceeded. In the last act it became necessary for me to  kiss the thin lady.    “I am very sorry,” said the thin lady, “but duty is duty. It has to be  done.”    Again I followed directions. The thin lady was good enough to  congratulate me on my performance.    The last three or four rehearsals we performed in company with the  principals. Divided counsels rendered them decidedly harassing. Our  chief comedian had his views, and they were decided; the leading lady  had hers, and was generous with them. The author of the English version  possessed his also, but of these nobody took much notice. Once every  twenty minutes the stage manager washed his hands of the whole affair  and left the theatre in despair, and anybody's hat that happened to  be handy, to return a few minutes later full of renewed hope. The  sentimental baritone was sarcastic, the tenor distinctly rude to  everybody. Mr. Hodgson's method was to agree with all and listen to  none. The smaller fry of the company, together with the more pushing of  the chorus, supported each in turn, when the others were not looking. Up  to the dress rehearsal it was anybody's opera.    About one thing, and about one thing, only, had the principals fallen  into perfect agreement, and that was that the fishy-eyed young gentleman  was out of place in a romantic opera. The tenor would be making  impassioned love to the leading lady. Perception would come to both of  them that, though they might be occupying geographically the centre of  the stage, dramatically they were not. Without a shred of evidence,  yet with perfect justice, they would unhesitatingly blame for this the  fishy-eyed young man.    “I wasn't doing anything,” he would explain meekly. “I was only  looking.” It was perfectly true; that was all he was doing.    “Then don't look,” would comment the tenor.    The fishy-eyed young gentleman obediently would turn his face away from  them; and in some mysterious manner the situation would thereupon become  even yet more hopelessly ridiculous.    “My scene, I think, sir!” would thunder our chief comedian, a little  later on.    “I am only doing what I was told to do,” answered the fishy-eyed young  gentleman; and nobody could say that he was not.    “Take a circus, and run him as a side-show,” counselled our comedian.    “I am afraid he would never be any good as a side-show,” replied Mr.  Hodgson, who was reading letters.    On the first night, passing the gallery entrance on my way to the stage  door, the sight of the huge crowd assembled there waiting gave me my  first taste of artistic joy. I was a part of what they had come to see,  to praise or to condemn, to listen to, to watch. Within the theatre  there was an atmosphere of suppressed excitement, amounting almost to  hysteria. The bird-like gentleman in his glass cage was fluttering,  agitated. The hands of the stage carpenters putting the finishing  touches to the scenery were trembling, their voices passionate  with anxiety; the fox-terrier-like call-boy was pale with sense of  responsibility.    I made my way to the dressing-room--a long, low, wooden corridor,  furnished from end to end with a wide shelf that served as common  dressing-table, lighted by a dozen flaring gas-jets, wire-shielded. Here  awaited us gentlemen of the chorus the wigmaker's assistant, whose duty  it was to make us up. From one to another he ran, armed with his hare's  foot, his box of paints and his bundle of crepe hair. My turn arriving,  he seized me by the head, jabbed a wig upon me, and in less than a  couple of minutes I left his hands the orthodox peasant of the stage,  white of forehead and pink of cheek, with curly moustache and lips of  coral. Glancing into the glass, I could not help feeling pleased with  myself; a moustache, without doubt, suited me.    The chorus ladies, when I met them on the stage, were a revelation  to me. Paint and powder though I knew their appearance to consist  of chiefly, yet in that hot atmosphere of the theatre, under that  artificial glare, it seemed fit and fascinating. The close approximation  to so much bare flesh, its curious, subtle odour was almost  intoxicating. Dr. Johnson's excuse to Garrick for the rarity of his  visits to the theatre recurred to me with understanding.    “How do you like my costume?” asked the thin lady with the golden hair.    “I think you--” We were standing apart behind a piece of projecting  scenery. She laid her hand upon my mouth, laughing.    “How old are you?” she asked me.    “Isn't that a rude question?” I answered. “I don't ask your age.    “Mine,” she replied, “entitles me to talk to you as I should to a boy of  my own--I had one once. Get out of this life if you can. It's bad for  a woman; it's worse still for a man. To you especially it will be  harmful.”    “Why to me in particular?”    “Because you are an exceedingly foolish little boy,” she answered, with  another laugh, “and are rather nice.”    She slipped away and joined the others. The chorus was now entirely  assembled on the stage. The sound of the rapidly-filling house reached  us, softened through the thick baize curtain, a dull, continuous  droning, as of water pouring into some huge cistern. Suddenly there fell  upon our ears a startling crash; the overture had commenced. The stage  manager--more suggestive of a sheep-dog than ever, but lacking the calm  dignity, the self-possession born of conscious capability distinctive of  his prototype; a fussy, argumentative sheep-dog--rushed into the midst  of us and worried us into our positions, where the more experienced  continued to converse in whispers, the rest of us waiting nervously,  trying to remember our words. The chorus master, taking his stand with  his back to the proscenium, held his white-gloved hand in readiness. The  curtain rushed up, the house, a nightmare of white faces, appearing to  run towards us. The chorus-master's white-gloved hand flung upward. A  roar of voices struck upon my ear, but whether my own were of them  I could not say; if I were singing at all it was unconsciously,  mechanically. Later, I found myself standing in the wings beside the  thin lady; the stage was in the occupation of the principals. On my next  entrance my senses were more with me; I was able to look about me. Here  and there a strongly-marked face among the audience stood out, but the  majority were as indistinguishable as so many blades of grass. Looked at  from the stage, the house seemed no more real than from the front do the  painted faces upon a black cloth.    The curtain fell amid the usual applause, sounding to us behind it like  the rattle of tiny stones against a window-pane. Three times it rose  and fell, like the opening and shutting of a door; and then followed a  scamper for the dressing-rooms, the long corridors being filled with the  rustling of skirts and the scurrying of feet.    It was in the second act that the fishy-eyed young gentleman came into  his own. The chorus had lingered till it was quite apparent that the  tenor and the leading lady were in love with each other; then, with the  exquisite delicacy so characteristic of a chorus, foreseeing that its  further presence might be embarrassing, it turned to go, half to the  east, the other half to the west. The fishy-eyed young man, starting  from the centre, was the last to leave the stage. In another moment he  would have disappeared from view. There came a voice from the gallery,  clear, distinct, pathetic with entreaty:    “Don't go. Get behind a tree.”    The request was instantly seconded by a roar of applause from every part  of the house, followed by laughter. From that point onward the house was  chiefly concerned with the fortunes of the fishy-eyed young gentleman.  At his next entrance, disguised as a conspirator, he was welcomed  with enthusiasm, his passing away regretted loudly. At the fall of the  curtain, the tenor, furious, rushed up to him, and, shaking a fist in  his face, demanded what he meant by it.    “I wasn't doing anything,” explained the fishy-eyed young man.    “You went off sideways!” roared the tenor.    “Well, you told me not to look at you,” explained meekly the fishy-eyed  young gentleman. “I must go off somehow. I regard you as a very  difficult man to please.”    At the final fall of the curtain the house appeared divided as regarded  the merits of the opera; but for “Goggles” there was a unanimous and  enthusiastic call, and the while we were dressing a message came for  “Goggles” that Mr. Hodgson wished to see him in his private room.    “He can make a funny face, no doubt about it,” commented one gentleman,  as “Goggles” left the room.    “I defy him to make a funnier one than God Almighty's made for him,”   responded the massive gentleman.    “There's a deal in luck,” observed, with a sigh, another, a tall,  handsome young gentleman possessed of a rich bass voice.    Leaving the stage door, I encountered a group of gentlemen waiting upon  the pavement outside. Not interested in them myself, I was hurrying  past, when one laid a hand upon my shoulder. I turned. He was a big,  broad-shouldered fellow, with a dark Vandyke beard and soft, dreamy  eyes.    “Dan!” I cried.    “I thought it was you, young 'un, in the first act,” he answered. “In  the second, when you came on without a moustache, I knew it. Are you in  a hurry?”    “Not at all,” I answered. “Are you?”    “No,” he replied; “we don't go to press till Thursday, so I can write my  notice to-morrow. Come and have supper with me at the Albion and we will  talk. You look tired, young 'un.”    “No,” I assured him, “only excited--partly at meeting you.”    He laughed, and drew my arm through his.        CHAPTER V.    HOW ON A SWEET GREY MORNING THE FUTURE CAME TO PAUL.    Over our supper Dan and I exchanged histories. They revealed points of  similarity. Leaving school some considerable time earlier than myself,  Dan had gone to Cambridge; but two years later, in consequence of the  death of his father, of a wound contracted in the Indian Mutiny and  never cured, had been compelled to bring his college career to an  untimely termination.    “You might not have expected that to grieve me,” said Dan, with a smile,  “but, as a matter of fact, it was a severe blow to me. At Cambridge I  discovered that I was by temperament a scholar. The reason why at school  I took no interest in learning was because learning was, of set purpose,  made as uninteresting as possible. Like a Cook's tourist party through a  picture gallery, we were rushed through education; the object being not  that we should see and understand, but that we should be able to say  that we had done it. At college I chose my own subjects, studied them  in my own way. I fed on knowledge, was not stuffed with it like a  Strassburg goose.”    Returning to London, he had taken a situation in a bank, the chairman of  which had been an old friend of his father. The advantage was that while  earning a small income he had time to continue his studies; but the  deadly monotony of the work had appalled him, and upon the death of his  mother he had shaken the cloying dust of the City from his brain and  joined a small “fit-up” theatrical company. On the stage he had remained  for another eighteen months; had played all roles, from “Romeo” to “Paul  Pry,” had helped to paint the scenery, had assisted in the bill-posting.  The latter, so he told me, he had found one of the most difficult of  accomplishments, the paste-laden poster having an innate tendency to  recoil upon the amateur's own head, and to stick there. Wearying of the  stage proper, he had joined a circus company, had been “Signor Ricardo,  the daring bare-back rider,” also one of the “Brothers Roscius in their  marvellous trapeze act;” inclining again towards respectability, had  been a waiter for three months at Ostend; from that, a footman.    “One never knows,” remarked Dan. “I may come to be a society novelist;  if so, inside knowledge of the aristocracy will give me decided  advantage over the majority of my competitors.”    Other callings he had sampled: had tramped through Ireland with a  fiddle; through Scotland with a lecture on Palestine, assisted by  dissolving views; had been a billiard-marker; next a schoolmaster. For  the last three months he had been a journalist, dramatic and musical  critic to a Sunday newspaper. Often had I dreamt of such a position for  myself.    “How did you obtain it?” I asked.    “The idea occurred to me,” replied Dan, “late one afternoon, sauntering  down the Strand, wondering what I should do next. I was on my beam ends,  with only a few shillings in my pocket; but luck has always been with  me. I entered the first newspaper office I came to, walked upstairs to  the first floor, and opening the first door without knocking, passed  through a small, empty room into a larger one, littered with books and  papers. It was growing dark. A gentleman of extremely youthful figure  was running round and round, cursing to himself because of three things:  he had upset the ink, could not find the matches, and had broken the  bell-pull. In the gloom, assuming him to be the office boy, I thought  it would be fun to mistake him for the editor. As a matter of fact,  he turned out to be the editor. I lit the gas for him, and found him  another ink-pot. He was a slim young man with the voice and manner of a  schoolboy. I don't suppose he is any more than five or six-and-twenty.  He owes his position to the fact of his aunt's being the proprietress.  He asked me if he knew me. Before I could tell him that he didn't, he  went on talking. He appeared to be labouring under a general sense of  injury.    “'People come into this office,' he said; 'they seem to look upon it as  a shelter from the rain--people I don't know from Adam. And that damned  fool downstairs lets them march straight up--anybody, men with articles  on safety valves, people who have merely come to kick up a row about  something or another. Half my work I have to do on the stairs.    “I recommended to him that he should insist upon strangers writing their  business upon a slip of paper. He thought it a good idea.    “'For the last three-quarters of an hour,' he said, 'have I been trying  to finish this one column, and four times have I been interrupted.'    “At that precise moment there came another knock at the door.    “'I won't see him!' he cried. 'I don't care who he is; I won't see him.  Send him away! Send everybody away!'    “I went to the door. He was an elderly gentleman. He made to sweep by  me; but I barred his way, and closed the editorial door behind me. He  seemed surprised; but I told him it was impossible for him to see the  editor that afternoon, and suggested his writing his business on a sheet  of paper, which I handed to him for the purpose. I remained in that  ante-room for half an hour, and during that time I suppose I must have  sent away about ten or a dozen people. I don't think their business  could have been important, or I should have heard about it afterwards.  The last to come was a tired-looking gentleman, smoking a cigarette. I  asked him his name.    “He looked at me in surprise, and then answered, 'Idiot!'    “I remained firm, however, and refused to let him pass.    “'It's a bit awkward,' he retorted. 'Don't you think you could make an  exception in favour of the sub-editor on press night?'    “I replied that such would be contrary to my instructions.    “'Oh, all right,' he answered. 'I'd like to know who's going to the  Royalty to-night, that's all. It's seven o'clock already.'    “An idea occurred to me. If the sub-editor of a paper doesn't know whom  to send to a theatre, it must mean that the post of dramatic critic on  that paper is for some reason or another vacant.    “'Oh, that's all right,' I told him. 'I shall be in time enough.'    “He appeared neither pleased nor displeased. 'Have you arranged with the  Guv'nor?' he asked me.    “'I'm just waiting to see him again for a few minutes,' I returned.  'It'll be all right. Have you got the ticket?'    “'Haven't seen it,' he replied.    “'About a column?' I suggested.    “'Three-quarters,' he preferred, and went.    “The moment he was gone, I slipped downstairs and met a printer's boy  coming up.    “'What's the name of your sub?' I asked him. 'Tall man with a black  moustache, looks tired.'    “'Oh, you mean Penton,' explained the boy.    “'That's the name,' I answered; 'couldn't think of it.'    “I walked straight into the editor; he was still irritable. 'What is it?  What is it now?' he snapped out.    “'I only want the ticket for the Royalty Theatre,' I answered. 'Penton  says you've got it.'    “'I don't know where it is,' he growled.    “I found it after some little search upon his desk.    “'Who's going?' he asked.    “'I am,' I said. And I went.    “They have never discovered to this day that I appointed myself. Penton  thinks I am some relation of the proprietress, and in consequence  everybody treats me with marked respect. Mrs. Wallace herself, the  proprietress, thinks I am the discovery of Penton, in whose judgment  she has great faith; and with her I get on admirably. The paper I  don't think is doing too well, and the salary is small, but sufficient.  Journalism suits my temperament, and I dare say I shall keep to it.”    “You've been somewhat of a rolling stone hitherto,” I commented.    He laughed. “From the stone's point of view,” he answered, “I never  could see the advantage of being smothered in moss. I should always  prefer remaining the stone, unhidden, able to move and see about me. But  now, to speak of other matters, what are your plans for the immediate  future? Your opera, thanks to the gentlemen, the gods have dubbed  'Goggles,' will, I fancy, run through the winter. Are you getting any  salary?”    “Thirty shillings a week,” I explained to him, “with full salary for  matinees.”    “Say two pounds,” he replied. “With my three we could set up an  establishment of our own. I have an idea that is original. Shall we work  it out together?”    I assured him with fervour that nothing would please me better.    “There are four delightful rooms in Queen's Square,” he continued. “They  are charmingly furnished: a fine sitting-room in the front, with  two bedrooms and a kitchen behind. Their last tenant was a Polish  Revolutionary, who, three months ago, poor fellow, was foolish enough to  venture back to Russia, and who is now living rent free. The landlord of  the house is an original old fellow, Deleglise the engraver. He occupies  the rest of the house himself. He has told me I can have the rooms for  anything I like to offer, and I should suggest thirty shillings a week,  though under ordinary circumstances they would be worth three or four  pounds. But he will only let us have them on the understanding that  we 'do for' ourselves. He is quite an oddity. He hates petticoats,  especially elderly petticoats. He has one servant, an old Frenchwoman,  who, I believe, was housekeeper to his mother, and he and she do the  housework together, most of their time quarrelling over it. Nothing else  of the genus domestic female will he allow inside the door; not even an  occasional charwoman would be permitted to us. On the other hand, it  is a beautiful old Georgian house, with Adams mantelpieces, a stone  staircase, and oak-panelled rooms; and our portion would be the entire  second floor: no pianos and no landlady. He is a widower with one child,  a girl of about fourteen or maybe a little older. Now, what do you say?  I am a very fair cook; will you be house-and-parlour-maid?”    I needed no pressing. A week later we were installed there, and for  nearly two years we lived there. At the risk of offending an adorable  but somewhat touchy sex, convinced that man, left to himself, is  capable of little more than putting himself to bed, and that only in  a rough-and-ready fashion, truth compels me to record the fact that  without female assistance or supervision of any kind we passed through  those two years, and yet exist to tell the tale. Dan had not idly  boasted. Better plain cooking I never want to taste; so good a cup of  coffee, omelette, or devilled kidney I rarely have tasted. Had he always  confined his efforts within the boundaries of his abilities, there  would be little to record beyond continuous and monotonous success.  But stirred into dangerous ambition at the call of an occasional tea or  supper party, lured out of his depths by the example of old Deleglise,  our landlord--a man who for twenty years had made cooking his hobby--Dan  would at intervals venture upon experiment. Pastry, it became evident,  was a thing he should never have touched: his hand was heavy and  his temperament too serious. There was a thing called lemon sponge,  necessitating much beating of eggs. In the cookery-book--a remarkably  fat volume, luscious with illustrations of highly-coloured food--it  appeared an airy and graceful structure of dazzling whiteness. Served as  Dan sent it to table, it suggested rather in form and colour a miniature  earthquake. Spongy it undoubtedly was. One forced it apart with the  assistance of one's spoon and fork; it yielded with a gentle tearing  sound. Another favourite dainty of his was manna-cake. Concerning it  I would merely remark that if it in any way resembled anything the  Children of Israel were compelled to eat, then there is explanation  for that fretfulness and discontent for which they have been, perhaps,  unjustly blamed--some excuse even for their backward-flung desires in  the direction of the Egyptian fleshpots. Moses himself may have been  blessed with exceptional digestion. It was substantial, one must say  that for it. One slice of it--solid, firm, crusty on the outside,  towards the centre marshy--satisfied most people to a sense of  repletion. For supper parties Dan would essay trifles--by no means open  to the criticism of being light as air--souffle's that guests, in spite  of my admonishing kicks, would persist in alluding to as pudding; and in  winter-time, pancakes. Later, as regards these latter, he acquired some  skill; but at first the difficulty was the tossing. I think myself a  safer plan would have been to turn them by the aid of a knife and fork;  it is less showy, but more sure. At least, you avoid all danger of  catching the half-baked thing upon your head instead of in the pan,  of dropping it into the fire, or among the cinders. But “Thorough” was  always Dan's motto; and after all, small particles of coal or a few  hairs can always be detected by the careful feeder, and removed.    A more even-tempered man than Dan for twenty-three hours out of every  twenty-four surely never breathed. It was a revelation to me to discover  that for the other he could be uncertain, irritable, even ungrateful.  At first, in a spirit of pure good nature, I would offer him counsel and  advice; explain to him why, as it seemed to me, the custard was pimply,  the mayonnaise sauce suggestive of hair oil. What was my return? Sneers,  insult and abuse, followed, if I did not clear out quickly, by spoilt  tomatoes, cold coffee grounds--anything that happened to be handy.  Pained, saddened, I would withdraw, he would kick the door to after me.  His greatest enemy appeared to be the oven. The oven it was that set  itself to thwart his best wrought schemes. Always it was the oven's  fault that the snowy bun appeared to have been made of red sandstone,  the macaroni cheese of Cambrian clay. One might have sympathised with  him more had his language been more restrained. As it was, the virulence  of his reproaches almost inclined one to take the part of the oven.    Concerning our house-maid, I can speak in terms of unqualified praise.  There are, alas, fussy house-maids--who has not known and suffered  them?--who overdo the thing, have no repose, no instinct telling  them when to ease up and let the place alone. I have always held the  perpetual stirring up of dust a scientific error; left to itself, it is  harmless, may even be regarded as a delicate domestic bloom, bestowing  a touch of homeliness upon objects that without it gleam cold and  unsympathetic. Let sleeping dogs lie. Why be continually waking up the  stuff, filling the air with all manner of unhealthy germs? Nature in her  infinite wisdom has ordained that upon table, floor, or picture frame it  shall sink and settle. There it remains, quiet and inoffensive; there it  will continue to remain so long as nobody interferes with it: why worry  it? So also with crumbs, odd bits of string, particles of egg-shell,  stumps of matches, ends of cigarettes: what fitter place for such than  under the nearest mat? To sweep them up is tiresome work. They cling to  the carpet, you get cross with them, curse them for their obstinacy,  and feel ashamed of yourself for your childishness. For every one you  do persuade into the dust-pan, two jump out again. You lose your temper,  feel bitter towards the man that dropped them. Your whole character  becomes deteriorated. Under the mat they are always willing to go.  Compromise is true statesmanship. There will come a day when you will  be glad of an excuse for not doing something else that you ought to  be doing. Then you can take up the mats and feel quite industrious,  contemplating the amount of work that really must be done--some time or  another.    To differentiate between the essential and the non-essential, that  is where woman fails. In the name of common sense, what is the use of  washing a cup that half an hour later is going to be made dirty again?  If the cat be willing and able to so clean a plate that not one speck of  grease remain upon it, why deprive her of pleasure to inflict toil upon  yourself? If a bed looks made and feels made, then for all practical  purposes it is made; why upset it merely to put it straight again? It  would surprise most women the amount of labour that can be avoided in a  house.    For needlework, I confess, I never acquired skill. Dan had learnt to  handle a thimble, but my own second finger was ever reluctant to come  forward when wanted. It had to be found, all other fingers removed out  of its way. Then, feebly, nervously, it would push, slip, get itself  pricked badly with the head of the needle, and, thoroughly frightened,  remain incapable of further action. More practical I found it to push  the needle through by help of the door or table.    The opera, as Dan had predicted, ran far into the following year. When  it was done with, another--in which “Goggles” appeared as one of the  principals--took its place, and was even more successful. After the  experience of Nelson Square, my present salary of thirty-five shillings,  occasionally forty shillings, a week seemed to me princely. There  floated before my eyes the possibility of my becoming a great opera  singer. On six hundred pounds a week, I felt I could be content. But the  O'Kelly set himself to dispel this dream.    “Ye'd be making a mistake, me boy,” explained the O'Kelly. “Ye'd be just  wasting ye're time. I wouldn't tell ye so if I weren't convinced of it.”    “I know it is not powerful,” I admitted.    “Ye might almost call it thin,” added the O'Kelly.    “It might be good enough for comic opera,” I argued. “People appear to  succeed in comic opera without much voice.    “Sure, there ye're right,” agreed the O'Kelly, with a sigh. “An' of  course if ye had an exceptionally fine presence and were strikingly  handsome--”    “One can do a good deal with make-up,” I suggested.    The O'Kelly shook his head. “It's never quite the same thing. It would  depend upon your acting.”    I dreamt of becoming a second Kean, of taking Macready's place. It need  not interfere with my literary ambition. I could combine the two: fill  Drury Lane in the evening, turn out epoch-making novels in the morning,  write my own plays.    Every day I studied in the reading-room of the British Museum. Wearying  of success in Art, I might eventually go into Parliament: a Prime  Minister with a thorough knowledge of history: why not? With Ollendorf  for guide, I continued French and German. It might be the diplomatic  service that would appeal to me in my old age. An ambassadorship! It  would be a pleasant termination to a brilliant career.    There was excuse for my optimistic mood about this period. All things  were going well with me. A story of mine had been accepted. I forget for  the moment the name of the journal: it is dead now. Most of the papers  in which my early efforts appeared are dead. My contributions might  be likened to their swan songs. Proofs had been sent me, which I had  corrected and returned. But proofs are not facts. This had happened to  me once before, and I had been lifted to the skies only to fall the more  heavily. The paper had collapsed before my story had appeared. (Ah, why  had they delayed? It might have saved them!) This time I remembered the  proverb, and kept my own counsel, slipping out early each morning on the  day of publication to buy the paper, to scan eagerly its columns. For  weeks I suffered hope deferred. But at last, one bright winter's day in  January, walking down the Harrow Road, I found myself standing still,  suddenly stunned, before a bill outside a small news-vendor's shop. It  was the first time I had seen my real name in print: “The Witch of Moel  Sarbod: a legend of Mona, by Paul Kelver.” (For this I had even risked  discovery by the Lady 'Ortensia.) My legs trembling under me, I entered  the shop. A ruffianly-looking man in dirty shirt-sleeves, who appeared  astonished that any one should want a copy, found one at length on  the floor underneath the counter. With it in my pocket, I retraced my  footsteps as in a dream. On a seat in Paddington Green I sat down and  read it. The hundred best books! I have waded through them all; they  have never charmed me as charmed me that one short story in that now  forgotten journal. Need I add it was a sad and sentimental composition.  Once upon a time there lived a mighty King; one--but with the names I  will not bore you; they are somewhat unpronounceable. Their selection  had cost me many hours of study in the British Museum reading-rooms,  surrounded by lexicons of the Welsh language, gazetteers, translations  from the early Celtic poets--with footnotes. He loved and was beloved by  a beautiful Princess, whose name, being translated, was Purity. One  day the King, hunting, lost his way, and being weary, lay down and fell  asleep. And by chance the spot whereon he lay was near to a place which  by infinite pains, with the aid of a magnifying glass, I had discovered  upon the map, and which means in English the Cave of the Waters, where  dwelt a wicked Sorceress, who, while he slept, cast her spells upon him,  so that he awoke to forget his kingly honour and the good of all his  people, his only desire being towards the Witch of Moel Sarbod.    Now, there lived in this Kingdom by the sea a great Magician; and  Purity, who loved the King far better than herself, bethought her of  him, and of all she had heard concerning his power and wisdom; and went  to him and besought his aid that she might save the King. There was but  one way to accomplish this: with bare feet Purity must climb the rocky  path leading to the Witch's dwelling, go boldly up to her, not fearing  her sharp claws nor her strong teeth, and kiss her upon the mouth. In  this way the spirit of Purity would pass into the Witch's soul, and she  would become a woman. But the form and spirit of the Witch would pass  into Purity, transforming her, and in the Cave of the Waters she must  forever abide. Thus Purity gave herself that the King might live. With  bleeding feet she climbed the rocky path, clasped the Witch's form  within her arms, kissed her on the mouth. And the Witch became a woman  and reigned with the King over his people, wisely and helpfully. But  Purity became a hideous witch, and to this day abides on Moel Sarbod,  where is the Cave of the Waters. And they who climb the mountain's side  still hear above the roaring of the cataract the sobbing of Purity,  the King's betrothed. But many liken it rather to a joyous song of love  triumphant.    No writer worth his salt was ever satisfied with anything he ever wrote,  so I have been told, and so I try to believe. Evidently I am not worth  my salt. Candid friends, and others, to whom in my salad days I used  to show my work, asking for a frank opinion, meaning, of course, though  never would they understand me, their unadulterated praise, would assure  me for my good, that this, my first to whom the gods gave life, was but  a feeble, ill-shaped child: its attempted early English a cross between  “The Pilgrim's Progress” and “Old Moore's Almanac;” its scenery--which  had cost me weeks of research--an apparent attempt to sum up in the  language of a local guide book the leading characteristics of the Garden  of Eden combined with Dante's Inferno; its pathos of the penny-plain  and two-penny-coloured order. Maybe they were right. Much have I written  since that at the time appeared to me good, that I have read later  with regret, with burning cheek, with frowning brow. But of this, my  first-born, the harbinger of all my hopes, I am no judge. Touching the  yellowing, badly-printed pages, I feel again the deep thrill of joy with  which I first unfolded them and read. Again I am a youngster, and life  opens out before me--inmeasurable, no goal too high. This child of my  brain, my work: it shall spread my name throughout the world. It shall  be a household world in lands that I shall never see. Friends whose  voices I shall never hear will speak of me. I shall die, but it shall  live, yield fresh seed, bear fruit I know not of. Generations yet unborn  shall read it and remember me. My thoughts, my words, my spirit: in it I  shall live again; it shall keep my memory green.    The long, long thoughts of boyhood! We elders smile at them. The  little world spins round; the little voices of an hour sink hushed. The  crawling generations come and go. The solar system drops from space. The  eternal mechanism reforms and shapes itself anew. Time, turning, ploughs  another furrow. So, growing sleepy, we murmur with a yawn. Is it that  we see clearer, or that our eyes are growing dim? Let the young men  see their visions, dream their dreams, hug to themselves their hopes of  enduring fame; so shall they serve the world better.    I brushed the tears from my eyes and looked up. Half-a-dozen urchins,  male and female, were gaping at me open-mouthed. They scattered  shouting, whether compliment or insult I know not: probably the latter.  I flung them a handful of coppers, which for the moment silenced them;  and went upon my way. How bright, how fair the bustling streets, golden  in the winter sunshine, thronged with life, with effort! Laughter rang  around me. Sweet music rolled from barrel-organs. The strenuous voices  of the costermongers called invitation to the fruitful earth. Errand  boys passed me whistling shrilly joyous melodies. Perspiring tradesmen  shouted generous offers to the needy. Men and women hurried by with  smiling faces. Sleek cats purred in sheltered nooks, till merry dogs  invited them to sport. The sparrows, feasting in the roadway, chirped  their hymn of praise.    At the Marble Arch I jumped upon a 'bus. I mentioned to the conductor  in mounting that it was a fine day. He replied that he had noticed it  himself. The retort struck me as a brilliant repartee. Our coachman, all  but run into by a hansom cab driven by a surly old fellow of patriarchal  appearance, remarked upon the danger of allowing horses out in charge of  bits of boys. How full the world of wit and humour!    Almost without knowing it, I found myself in earnest conversation with  a young man sitting next to me. We conversed of life, of love. Not until  afterwards, reflecting upon the matter, did it surprise me that to a  mere chance acquaintance of the moment he had spoken of the one thing  dearest to his heart: a sweet but clearly wayward maiden, the Hebe of  a small, old-fashioned coffee-shop the 'bus was at that moment passing.  Hitherto I had not been the recipient of confidences. It occurred to me  that as a rule not even my friends spoke much to me concerning their  own affairs; generally it was I who spoke to them of mine. I sympathised  with him, advised him--how, I do not recollect. He said, however, he  thought that I was right; and at Regent Street he left me, expressing  his determination to follow my counsel, whatever it may have been.    Between Berners Street and the Circus I lent a shilling to a couple of  young ladies who had just discovered with amusement, quickly swallowed  by despair, that they neither of them had any money with them. (They  returned it next day in postage stamps, with a charming note.) The  assurance with which I tendered the slight service astonished me myself.  At any other time I should have hesitated, argued with my fears, offered  it with an appearance of sulky constraint, and been declined. For  a moment they were doubtful, then, looking at me, accepted with a  delightful smile. They consulted me as to the way to Paternoster Row.  I instructed them, adding a literary anecdote, which seemed to interest  them. I even ventured on a compliment, neatly phrased, I am inclined to  think. Evidently it pleased--a result hitherto unusual in the case of  my compliments. At the corner of Southampton Row I parted from them with  regret. Why had I never noticed before how full of pleasant people this  sweet and smiling London?    At the corner of Queen's Square a decent-looking woman stopped me to ask  the way to the Children's Hospital at Chelsea, explaining she had made a  mistake, thinking it was the one in Great Ormond Street where her child  lay. I directed her, then glancing into her face, noticed how tired  she looked, and a vista of the weary pavements she would have to tramp  flashed before me. I slipped some money into her hand and told her to  take a 'bus. She flushed, then thanked me. I turned a few yards further  on; she was starting after me, amazement on her face. I laughed and  waved my hand to her. She smiled back in return, and went her way.    A rain began to fall. I paused upon the doorstep for a minute, enjoying  the cool drops upon by upturned face, the tonic sharpness of the keen  east wind; then slipped my key into the lock and entered.    The door of old Deleglise's studio on the first floor happened to be  open. Hitherto, beyond the usual formal salutations, when by chance we  met upon the stairs, I had exchanged but few words with my eccentric  landlord; but remembering his kindly face, the desire came upon me  to tell him my good fortune. I felt sure his eyes would lighten with  delight. By instinct I knew him for a young man's man.    I tapped lightly; no answer came. Someone was talking; it sounded like a  girl's voice. I pushed the door further open and walked in; such was the  custom of the house. It was a large room, built over the yard, lighted  by one high window, before which was the engraving desk, shaded under  a screen of tissue paper. At the further end of the room stood a large  cheval-glass, and in front of this, its back towards me, was a figure  that excited my curiosity; so that remaining where I was, partly hidden  behind a large easel, I watched it for awhile in silence. Above a  heavily flounced blue skirt, which fell in creases on the floor  and trailed a couple of yards or so behind, it wore a black low-cut  sleeveless bodice--much too big for it--of the fashion early Victorian.  A good deal of dark-brown hair, fastened up by hair-pins that stuck out  in all directions like quills upon a porcupine, suggesting collapse with  every movement, was ornamented by three enormous green feathers, one  of which hung limply over the lady's left ear. Three times, while I  watched, unnoticed, the lady propped it into a more befitting attitude,  and three times, limp and intoxicated-looking, it fell back into its  former foolish position. Her long, thin arms, displaying a pair of  brilliantly red elbows, pointed to quite a dangerous degree, terminated  in hands so very sunburnt as to convey the impression of a pair of  remarkably well-fitting gloves. Her right hand grasped and waved with  determination a large lace fan, her left clutched fiercely the front of  her skirt. With a sweeping curtsey to herself in the glass, which would  have been more effective could she have avoided tying her legs together  with her skirt--a _contretemps_ necessitating the use of both hands and  a succession of jumps before she could disentangle herself--she remarked  so soon as she had recovered her balance:    “So sorry I am late. My carriage was unfortunately delayed.”    The excuse, I gathered, was accepted, for with a gracious smile and  a vigorous bow, by help of which every hairpin made distinct further  advance towards freedom, she turned, and with much dignity and head  over the right shoulder took a short walk to the left. At the end of six  short steps she stopped and began kicking. For what reason, I, at first,  could not comprehend. It dawned upon me after awhile that her object  was the adjustment of her train. Finding the manoeuvre too difficult of  accomplishment by feet alone, she stooped, and, taking the stuff up in  her hands, threw it behind her. Then, facing north, she retraced  her steps to the glass, talking to herself, as she walked, in the  high-pitched drawl, distinctive, as my stage knowledge told me, of  aristocratic society.    “Oh, do you think so--really? Ah, yes; you say that. Certainly not! I  shouldn't think of it.” There followed what I am inclined to believe was  intended for a laugh, musical but tantalising. If so, want of practice  marred the effort. The performance failed to satisfy even herself. She  tried again; it was still only a giggle.    Before the glass she paused, and with a haughty inclination of her head  succeeded for the third time in displacing the intoxicated feather.    “Oh, bother the silly thing!” she said in a voice so natural as to be,  by contrast with her previous tone, quite startling.    She fixed it again with difficulty, muttering something inarticulate.  Then, her left hand resting on an imaginary coat-sleeve, her right  holding her skirt sufficiently high to enable her to move, she commenced  to majestically gyrate.    Whether, hampered as she was by excess of skirt, handicapped by the  natural clumsiness of her age, catastrophe in any case would not sooner  or later have overtaken her, I have my doubts. I have since learnt her  own view to be that but for catching sight, in turning, of my face,  staring at her through the bars of the easel, all would have gone well  and gracefully. Avoiding controversy on this point, the facts to be  recorded are, that, seeing me, she uttered a sudden exclamation of  surprise, dropped her skirt, trod on her train, felt her hair coming  down, tried to do two things at once, and sat upon the floor. I ran to  her assistance. With flaming face and flashing eyes she sprang to her  feet. There was a sound as of the rushing down of avalanches. The blue  flounced skirt lay round her on the floor. She stood above its billowy  folds, reminiscent of Venus rising from the waves--a gawky, angular  Venus in a short serge frock, reaching a little below her knees, black  stockings and a pair of prunella boots of a size suggesting she had yet  some inches to grow before reaching her full height.    “I hope you haven't hurt yourself,” I said.    The next moment I didn't care whether she had or whether she hadn't.  She did not reply to my kindly meant enquiry. Instead, her hand swept  through the air in the form of an ample semi-circle. It terminated on  my ear. It was not a small hand; it was not a soft hand; it was not  that sort of hand. The sound of the contact rang through the room like a  pistol shot; I heard it with my other ear. I sprang at her, and catching  her before she had recovered her equilibrium, kissed her. I did not kiss  her because I wanted to. I kissed her because I could not box her ears  back in return, which I should have preferred doing. I kissed her,  hoping it would make her mad. It did. If a look could have killed me,  such would have been the tragic ending of this story. It did not kill  me; it did me good.    “You horrid boy!” she cried. “You horrid, horrid boy!”    There, I admit, she scored. I did not in the least object to her  thinking me horrid, but at nineteen one does object to being mistaken  for a boy.    “I am not a boy,” I explained.    “Yes, you are,” she retorted; “a beast of a boy!”    “If you do it again,” I warned her--a sudden movement on her part  hinting to me the possibility--“I'll kiss you again! I mean it.”    “Leave the room!” she commanded, pointing with her angular arm towards  the door.    I did not wish to remain. I was about to retire with as much dignity as  circumstances permitted.    “Boy!” she added.    At that I turned. “Now I won't go!” I replied. “See if I do.”    We stood glaring at each other.    “What right have you in here?” she demanded.    “I came to see Mr. Deleglise,” I answered. “I suppose you are Miss  Deleglise. It doesn't seem to me that you know how to treat a visitor.”    “Who are you?” she asked.    “Mr. Horace Moncrieff,” I replied. I was using at the period both my  names indiscriminately, but for this occasion Horace Moncrieff I judged  the more awe-inspiring.    She snorted. “I know. You're the house-maid. You sweep all the crumbs  under the mats.”    Now this was a subject about which at the time I was feeling somewhat  sore. “Needs must when the Devil drives;” but as matters were, Dan and I  could well have afforded domestic assistance. It rankled in my mind that  to fit in with the foolish fad of old Deleglise, I the future Dickens,  Thackeray and George Eliot, Kean, Macready and Phelps rolled into one,  should be compelled to the performance of menial duties. On this morning  of all others, my brilliant literary career just commenced, the anomaly  of the thing appeared naturally more glaring.    Besides, how came she to know I swept the crumbs under the mat--that it  was my method? Had she and Dan been discussing me, ridiculing me behind  my back? What right had Dan to reveal the secrets of our menage to this  chit of a school-girl? Had he done so? or had she been prying, poking  her tilted nose into matters that did not concern her? Pity it was she  had no mother to occasionally spank her, teach her proper behaviour.    “Where I sweep our crumbs is nothing to do with you,” I replied with  some spirit. “That I have to sweep them at all is the fault of your  father. A sensible girl--”    “How dare you speak against my father!” she interrupted me with blazing  eyes.    “We will not discuss the question further,” I answered, with sense and  dignity.    “I think you had better not!” she retorted.    Turning her back on me, she commenced to gather up her hairpins--there  must have been about a hundred of them. I assisted her to the extent of  picking up about twenty, which I handed to her with a bow: it may have  been a little stiff, but that was only to be expected. I wished to show  her that her bad example had not affected my own manners.    “I am sorry my presence should have annoyed you,” I said. “It was quite  an accident. I entered the room thinking your father was here.”    “When you saw he wasn't, you might have gone out again,” she replied,  “instead of hiding yourself behind a picture.”    “I didn't hide myself,” I explained. “The easel happened to be in the  way.”    “And you stopped there and watched me.”    “I couldn't help it.”    She looked round and our eyes met. They were frank, grey eyes. An  expression of merriment shot into them. I laughed.    Then she laughed: it was a delightful laugh, the laugh one would have  expected from her.    “You might at least have coughed,” she suggested.    “It was so amusing,” I pleaded.    “I suppose it was,” she agreed, and held out her hand. “Did I hurt you?”   she asked.    “Yes, you did,” I answered, taking it.    “Well, it was enough to annoy me, wasn't it?” she suggested.    “Evidently,” I agreed.    “I am going to a ball next week,” she explained, “a grown-up ball, and  I've got to wear a skirt. I wanted to see if I could manage a train.”    “Well, to be candid, you can't,” I assured her.    “It does seem difficult.”    “Shall I show you?” I asked.    “What do you know about it?”    “Well, I see it done every night.”    “Oh, yes; of course, you're on the stage. Yes, do.”    We readjusted the torn skirt, accommodating it better to her figure by  the help of hairpins. I showed her how to hold the train, and, I humming  a tune, we commenced to waltz.    “I shouldn't count my steps,” I suggested to her. “It takes your mind  away from the music.”    “I don't waltz well,” she admitted meekly. “I know I don't do anything  well--except play hockey.”    “And try not to tread on your partner's feet. That's a very bad fault.”    “I do try not to,” she explained.    “It comes with practice,” I assured her.    “I'll get Tom to give me half an hour every evening,” she said. “He  dances beautifully.”    “Who's Tom?”    “Oh, father.”    “Why do you call your father Tom? It doesn't sound respectful.”    “Oh, he likes it; and it suits him so much better than father. Besides,  he isn't like a real father. He does everything I want him to.”    “Is that good for you?”    “No; it's very bad for me--everybody says so. When you come to think of  it, of course it isn't the way to bring up a girl. I tell him, but he  merely laughs--says it's the only way he knows. I do hope I turn out all  right. Am I doing it better now?”    “A little. Don't be too anxious about it. Don't look at your feet.”    “But if I don't they go all wrong. It was you who trod on mine that  time.”    “I know. I'm sorry. It's a little difficult not to.”    “Am I holding my train all right?”    “Well, there's no need to grip it as if you were afraid it would run  away. It will follow all right. Hold it gracefully.”    “I wish I wasn't a girl.”    “Oh, you'll get used to it.” We concluded our dance.    “What do I do--say 'Thank you'?”    “Yes, prettily.”    “What does he do?”    “Oh, he takes you back to your chaperon, or suggests refreshment, or you  sit and talk.”    “I hate talking. I never know what to say.”    “Oh, that's his duty. He'll try and amuse you, then you must laugh. You  have a nice laugh.”    “But I never know when to laugh. If I laugh when I want to it always  offends people. What do you do if somebody asks you to dance and you  don't want to dance with them?”    “Oh, you say your programme is full.”    “But if it isn't?”    “Well, you tell a lie.”    “Couldn't I say I don't dance well, and that I'm sure they'd get on  better with somebody else?”    “It would be the truth, but they might not believe it.”    “I hope nobody asks me that I don't want.”    “Well, he won't a second time, anyhow.”    “You are rude.”    “You are only a school-girl.”    “I look a woman in my new frock, I really do.”    “I should doubt it.”    “You shall see me, then you'll be polite. It is because you are a boy  you are rude. Men are much nicer.”    “Oh, are they?”    “Yes. You will be, when you are a man.”    The sound of voices rose suddenly in the hall.    “Tom!” cried Miss Deleglise; and collecting her skirt in both hands,  bolted down the corkscrew staircase leading to the kitchen, leaving me  standing in the centre of the studio.    The door opened and old Deleglise entered, accompanied by a small,  slight man with red hair and beard and somewhat watery eyes.    Deleglise himself was a handsome old fellow, then a man of about  fifty-five. His massive, mobile face, illuminated by bright, restless  eyes, was crowned with a lion-like mane of iron-grey hair. Till a few  years ago he had been a painter of considerable note. But in questions  of art his temper was short. Pre-Raphaelism had gone out of fashion for  the time being; the tendency of the new age was towards impressionism,  and in disgust old Deleglise had broken his palette across his knee, and  swore never to paint again. Artistic work of some sort being necessary  to his temperament, he contented himself now with engraving. At the  moment he was engaged upon the reproduction of Memlinc's Shrine of St.  Ursula, with photographs of which he had just returned from Bruges.    At sight of me his face lighted with a smile, and he advanced with  outstretched hand.    “Ah; my lad, so you have got over your shyness and come to visit the old  bear in his den. Good boy. I like young faces.”    He had a clear, musical voice, ever with the suggestion of a laugh  behind it. He laid his hand upon my shoulder.    “Why, you are looking as if you had come into a fortune,” he added, “and  didn't know what a piece of bad luck that can be to a young fellow like  yourself.”    “How could it be bad luck?” I asked, laughing.    “Takes all the sauce out of life, young man,” answered Deleglise. “What  interest is there in running a race with the prize already in your  possession, tell me that?”    “It is not that kind of fortune,” I answered, “it is another. I have had  my first story accepted. It is in print. Look.”    I handed him the paper. He spread it out upon the engraving board before  him.    “Ah, that's better,” he said, “that's better. Charlie,” he turned to the  red-headed man, who had seated himself listlessly in the one easy-chair  the room contained, “come here.”    The red-headed man rose and wandered towards us. “Let me introduce you  to Mr. Paul Kelver, our new fellow servant. Our lady has accepted him.  He has just been elected; his first story is in print.”    The red-haired man stretched out his long thin hand. “I have thirty  years of fame,” said the red-haired man--“could I say world-wide?”    He turned for confirmation to old Deleglise, who laughed. “I think you  can.”    “If I could give it you would you exchange with me--at this moment?”    “You would be a fool if you did,” he went on. “One's first success,  one's first victory! It is the lover's first kiss. Fortune grows old and  wrinkled, frowns more often than she smiles. We become indifferent to  her, quarrel with her, make it up again. But the joy of her first kiss  after the long wooing! Burn it into your memory, my young friend, that  it may live with you always!”    He strolled away. Old Deleglise took up the parable.    “Ah, yes; one's first success, Paul! Laugh, my boy, cry! Shut yourself  up in your room, shout, dance! Throw your hat into the air and cry  hurrah! Make the most of it, Paul. Hug it to your heart, think of it,  dream of it. This is the finest hour of your life, my boy. There will  never come another like it--never!”    He crossed the studio, and taking from its nail a small oil painting,  brought it over and laid it on the board beside my paper. It was a  fascinating little picture, painted with that exquisite minutiae and  development of detail that a newer school was then ridiculing: as though  Art had but one note to her voice. The dead figure of an old man lay  upon a bed. A child had crept into the darkened room, and supporting  itself by clutching tightly at the sheet, was gazing with solemn  curiosity upon the white, still face.    “That was mine,” said old Deleglise. “It was hung in the Academy  thirty-six years ago, and bought for ten guineas by a dentist at Bury  St. Edmunds. He went mad a few years later and died in a lunatic asylum.  I had never lost sight of it, and the executors were quite agreeable  to my having it back again for the same ten guineas. I used to go every  morning to the Academy to look at it. I thought it the cleverest bit of  work in the whole gallery, and I'm not at all sure that it wasn't. I  saw myself a second Teniers, another Millet. Look how that light coming  through the open door is treated; isn't it good? Somebody will pay a  thousand guineas for it before I have been dead a dozen years, and it  is worth it. But I wouldn't sell it myself now for five thousand. One's  first success; it is worth all the rest of life!”    “All?” queried the red-haired man from his easy-chair. We looked round.  The lady of the skirt had entered, now her own proper self: a young girl  of about fifteen, angular, awkward-looking, but bringing into the room  with her that atmosphere of life, of hope, that is the eternal message  of youth. She was not beautiful, not then--plain one might almost have  called her but for her frank, grey eyes, her mass of dark-brown hair  now gathered into a long thick plait. A light came into old Deleglise's  eyes.    “You are right, not all,” he murmured to the red-haired man.    She came forward shyly. I found it difficult to recognise in her the  flaming Fury that a few minutes before had sprung at me from the billows  of her torn blue skirt. She shook hands with the red-haired man and  kissed her father.    “My daughter,” said old Deleglise, introducing me to her. “Mr. Paul  Kelver, a literary gent.”    “Mr. Kelver and I have met already,” she explained. “He has been waiting  for you here in the studio.”    “And have you been entertaining him?” asked Deleglise. “Oh, yes,  I entertained him,” she replied. Her voice was singularly like her  father's, with just the same suggestion of ever a laugh behind it.    “We entertained each other,” I said.    “That's all right,” said old Deleglise. “Stop and lunch with us. We will  make ourselves a curry.”        CHAPTER VI.    OF THE GLORY AND GOODNESS AND THE EVIL THAT GO TO THE MAKING OF LOVE.    During my time of struggle I had avoided all communication with old  Hasluck. He was not a man to sympathise with feelings he did not  understand. With boisterous good humour he would have insisted upon  helping me. Why I preferred half starving with Lott and Co. to selling  my labour for a fair wage to good-natured old Hasluck, merely because  I knew him, I cannot explain. Though the profits may not have been so  large, Lott and Co.'s dealings were not one whit more honest: I do not  believe it was that which decided me. Nor do I think it was because he  was Barbara's father. I never connected him, nor that good old soul,  his vulgar, homely wife, in any way with Barbara. To me she was a being  apart from all the world. Her true Parents! I should have sought them  rather amid the sacred groves of vanished lands, within the sky-domed  shrines of banished gods. There are instincts in us not easily  analysed, not to be explained by reason. I have always preferred the  finding--sometimes the losing--of my way according to the map, to the  surer and simpler method of vocal enquiry; working out a complicated  journey, and running the risk of never arriving at my destination,  by aid of a Continental Bradshaw, to putting myself into the hands  of courteous officials maintained and paid to assist the perplexed  traveller. Possibly a far-off progenitor of mine may have been some  morose “rogue” savage with untribal inclinations, living in his  cave apart, fashioning his own stone hammer, shaping his own flint  arrow-heads, shunning the merry war-dance, preferring to caper by  himself.    But now, having gained my own foothold, I could stretch out my hand  without fear of the movement being mistaken for appeal. I wrote to old  Hasluck; and almost by the next post received from him the friendliest  of notes. He told me Barbara had just returned from abroad, took it upon  himself to add that she also would be delighted to see me, and, as I  knew he would, threw his doors open to me.    Of my boyish passion for Barbara never had I spoken to a living soul,  nor do I think, excepting Barbara herself, had any ever guessed it. To  my mother, though she was very fond of her, Barbara was only a girl,  with charms but also with faults, concerning which my mother would  speak freely; hurting me, as one unwittingly might hurt a neophyte by  philosophical discussion of his newly embraced religion. Often, choosing  by preference late evening or the night, I would wander round and round  the huge red-brick house standing in its ancient garden on the top  of Stamford Hill; descending again into the noisome streets as one  returning to the world from praying at a shrine, purified, filled with  peace, all noble endeavour, all unselfish aims seeming within my grasp.    During Barbara's four years' absence my adoration had grown and  strengthened. Out of my memory of her my desire had evolved its ideal; a  being of my imagination, but by reason of that, to me the more real,  the more present. I looked forward to seeing her again, but with no  impatience, revelling rather in the anticipation than eager for the  realisation. As a creature of flesh and blood, the child I had played  with, talked with, touched, she had faded further and further into the  distance; as the vision of my dreams she stood out clearer day by day. I  knew that when next I saw her there would be a gulf between us I had  no wish to bridge. To worship her from afar was a sweeter thought to me  than would have been the hope of a passionate embrace. To live with her,  sit opposite to her while she ate and drank, see her, perhaps, with her  hair in curl-papers, know possibly that she had a corn upon her foot,  hear her speak maybe of a decayed tooth, or of a chilblain, would have  been torture to me. Into such abyss of the commonplace there was no fear  of my dragging her, and for this I was glad. In the future she would be  yet more removed from me. She was older than I was; she must be now a  woman. Instinctively I felt that in spite of years I was not yet a man.  She would marry. The thought gave me no pain, my feeling for her was  utterly devoid of appetite. No one but myself could close the temple  I had built about her, none deny to me the right of entry there. No  jealous priest could hide her from my eyes, her altar I had reared too  high. Since I have come to know myself better, I perceive that she stood  to me not as a living woman, but as a symbol; not a fellow human being  to be walked with through life, helping and to be helped, but that  impalpable religion of sex to which we raise up idols of poor human  clay, alas, not always to our satisfaction, so that foolishly we fall  into anger against them, forgetting they were but the work of our own  hands; not the body, but the spirit of love.    I allowed a week to elapse after receiving old Hasluck's letter before  presenting myself at Stamford Hill. It was late one afternoon in early  summer. Hasluck had not returned from the City, Mrs. Hasluck was out  visiting, Miss Hasluck was in the garden. I told the supercilious  footman not to trouble, I would seek her there myself. I guessed where  she would be; her favourite spot had always been a sunny corner, bright  with flowers, surrounded by a thick yew hedge, cut, after the Dutch  fashion, into quaint shapes of animals and birds. She was walking there,  as I had expected, reading a book. And again, as I saw her, came back  to me the feeling that had swept across me as a boy, when first outlined  against the dusty books and papers of my father's office she had flashed  upon my eyes: that all the fairy tales had suddenly come true, only  now, instead of the Princess, she was the Queen. Taller she was, with  a dignity that formerly had been the only charm she lacked. She did not  hear my coming, my way being across the soft, short grass, and for a  little while I stood there in the shadow of the yews, drinking in the  beauty of her clear-cut profile, bent down towards her book, the curving  lines of her long neck, the wonder of the exquisite white hand against  the lilac of her dress.    I did not speak; rather would I have remained so watching; but turning  at the end of the path, she saw me, and as she came towards me held out  her hand. I knelt upon the path, and raised it to my lips. The action  was spontaneous, till afterwards I was not aware of having done it. Her  lips were smiling as I raised my eyes to them, the faintest suggestion  of contempt mingling with amusement. Yet she seemed pleased, and her  contempt, even if I were not mistaken, would not have wounded me.    “So you are still in love with me? I wondered if you would be.”    “Did you know that I was in love with you?”    “I should have been blind if I had not.”    “But I was only a boy.”    “You were not the usual type of boy. You are not going to be the usual  type of man.”    “You do not mind my loving you?”    “I cannot help it, can I? Nor can you.”    She seated herself on a stone bench facing a sun-dial, and leaning hack,  her hands clasped behind her head, looked at me and laughed.    “I shall always love you,” I answered, “but it is with a curious sort of  love. I do not understand it myself.”    “Tell me,” she commanded, still with a smile about her lips, “describe  it to me.”    I was standing over against her, my arm resting upon the dial's stone  column. The sun was sinking, casting long shadows on the velvety grass,  illuminating with a golden light her upturned face.    “I would you were some great queen of olden days, and that I might be  always near you, serving you, doing your bidding. Your love in return  would spoil all; I shall never ask it, never desire it. That I might  look upon you, touch now and then at rare intervals with my lips your  hand, kiss in secret the glove you had let fall, the shoe you had flung  off, know that you knew of my love, that I was yours to do with as you  would, to live or die according to your wish. Or that you were priestess  in some temple of forgotten gods, where I might steal at daybreak and at  dusk to gaze upon your beauty; kneel with clasped hands, watching your  sandalled feet coming and going about the altar steps; lie with pressed  lips upon the stones your trailing robes had touched.”    She laughed a light mocking laugh. “I should prefer to be the queen.  The role of priestess would not suit me. Temples are so cold.” A slight  shiver passed through her. She made a movement with her hand, beckoning  me to her feet. “That is how you shall love me, Paul,” she said,  “adoring me, worshipping me--blindly. I will be your queen and treat  you--as it chooses me. All I think, all I do, I will tell you, and you  shall tell me it is right. The queen can do no wrong.”    She took my face between her hands, and bending over me, looked long  and steadfastly into my eyes. “You understand, Paul, the queen can do  no wrong--never, never.” There had crept into her voice a note of  vehemence, in her face was a look almost of appeal.    “My queen can do no wrong,” I repeated. And she laughed and let her  hands fall back upon her lap.    “Now you may sit beside me. So much honour, Paul, shall you have to-day,  but it will have to last you long. And you may tell me all you have been  doing, maybe it will amuse me; and afterwards you shall hear what I have  done, and shall say that it was right and good of me.”    I obeyed, sketching my story briefly, yet leaving nothing untold, not  even the transit of the Lady 'Ortensia, ashamed of the episode though I  was. At that she looked a little grave.    “You must do nothing again, Paul,” she commanded, “to make me feel  ashamed of you, or I shall dismiss you from my presence for ever. I must  be proud of you, or you shall not serve me. In dishonouring yourself you  are dishonouring me. I am angry with you, Paul. Do not let me be angry  with you again.”    And so that passed; and although my love for her--as I know well she  wished and sought it should--failed to save me at all times from the  apish voices whispering ever to the beast within us, I know the desire  to be worthy of her, to honour her with all my being, helped my life as  only love can. The glory of the morning fades, the magic veil is rent;  we see all things with cold, clear eyes. My love was a woman. She lies  dead. They have mocked her white sweet limbs with rags and tatters, but  they cannot cheat love's eyes. God knows I loved her in all purity! Only  with false love we love the false. Beneath the unclean clinging garments  she sleeps fair.    My tale finished, “Now I will tell you mine,” she said. “I am going to  be married soon. I shall be a Countess, Paul, the Countess Huescar--I  will teach you how to pronounce it--and I shall have a real castle in  Spain. You need not look so frightened, Paul; we shall not live there.  It is a half-ruined, gloomy place, among the mountains, and he loves it  even less than I do. Paris and London will be my courts, so you will  see me often. You shall know the great world, Paul, the world I mean to  conquer, where I mean to rule.”    “Is he very rich?” I asked.    “As poor,” she laughed, “as poor as a Spanish nobleman. The money I  shall have to provide, or, rather, poor dear Dad will. He gives me  title, position. Of course I do not love him, handsome though he is.  Don't look so solemn, Paul. We shall get on together well enough.  Queens, Paul, do not make love matches, they contract alliances. I have  done well, Paul; congratulate me. Do you hear, Paul? Say that I have  acted rightly.”    “Does he love you?” I asked.    “He tells me so,” she answered, with a laugh. “How uncourtier-like you  are, Paul! Do you suggest that any man could see me and not love me?”    She sprang to her feet. “I do not want his love,” she cried; “it would  bore me. Women hate love they cannot return. I don't mean love like  yours, devout little Paul,” she added, with a laugh. “That is sweet  incense wafted round us that we like to scent with our noses in the air.  Give me that, Paul; I want it, I ask for it. But the love of a hand, the  love of a husband that one does not care for--it would be horrible!”    I felt myself growing older. For the moment my goddess became a child  needing help.    “But have you thought--” I commenced.    “Yes, yes,” she interrupted me quickly, “I have thought and thought till  I can think no more. There must be some sacrifice; it must be as little  as need be, that is all. He does not love me; he is marrying me for my  money--I know that, and I am glad of it. You do not know me, Paul. I  must have rank, position. What am I? The daughter of rich old Hasluck,  who began life as a butcher in the Mile End Road. As the Princess  Huescar, society will forget, as Mrs.”--it seemed to me she checked  herself abruptly--“Jones or Brown it would remember, however rich  I might be. I am vain, Paul, caring for power--ambition. I have my  father's blood in me. All his nights and days he has spent in gaining  wealth; he can do no more. We upstarts have our pride of race. He has  done his share, I must do mine.”    “But you need not be mere Mrs. anybody commonplace,” I argued. “Why not  wait? You will meet someone who can give you position and whom at the  same time you can love. Would that not be better?”    “He will never come, the man I could love,” she answered. “Because,  my little Paul, he has come already. Hush, Paul, the queen can do no  wrong.”    “Who is he?” I asked. “May I not know?”    “Yes, Paul,” she answered, “you shall know; I want you to know, then you  shall tell me that I have acted rightly. Do you hear me, Paul?--quite  rightly--that you still respect me and honour me. He could not help me.  As his wife, I should be less even than I am, a mere rich nobody, giving  long dinner-parties to other rich nobodies, living amongst City men,  retired trades-people; envied only by their fat, vulgarly dressed wives,  courted by seedy Bohemians for the sake of my cook; with perhaps an  opera singer or an impecunious nobleman or two out of Dad's City list  for my show-guests. Is that the court, Paul, where you would have your  queen reign?”    “Is he so commonplace a man,” I answered, “the man you love? I cannot  believe it.”    “He is not commonplace,” she answered. “It is I who am commonplace. The  things I desire, they are beneath him; he will never trouble himself to  secure them.”    “Not even for love of you?”    “I would not have him do so even were he willing. He is great, with a  greatness I cannot even understand. He is not the man for these times.  In old days, I should have married him, knowing he would climb to  greatness by sheer strength of manhood. But now men do not climb; they  crawl to greatness. He could not do that. I have done right, Paul.”    “What does he say?” I asked.    “Shall I tell you?” She laughed a little bitterly. “I can give you his  exact words, 'You are half a woman and half a fool, so woman-like you  will follow your folly. But let your folly see to it that your woman  makes no fool of herself.'”    The words were what I could imagine his saying. I heard the strong ring  of his voice through her mocking mimicry.    “Hal!” I cried. “It is he.”    “So you never guessed even that, Paul. I thought at times it would be  sweet to cry it out aloud, that it could have made no difference, that  everyone who knew me must have read it in my eyes.”    “But he never seemed to take much notice of you,” I said.    She laughed. “You needn't be so unkind, Paul. What did I ever do for  you much more than snub you? We boys and girls; there is not so much  difference between us: we love our masters. Yet you must not think so  poorly of me. I was only a child to him then, but we were locked up in  Paris together during the entire siege. Have not you heard? He did take  a little notice of me there, Paul, I assure you.”    Would it have been better, I wonder, had she followed the woman and not  the fool? It sounds an easy question to answer; but I am thinking of  years later, one winter's night at Tiefenkasten in the Julier Pass. I  was on my way from San Moritz to Chur. The sole passenger, I had just  climbed, half frozen, from the sledge, and was thawing myself before the  stove in the common room of the hotel when the waiter put a pencilled  note into my hand:    “Come up and see me. I am a prisoner in this damned hole till the  weather breaks. Hal.”    I hardly recognised him at first. Only the poor ghost he seemed of the  Hal I had known as a boy. His long privations endured during the Paris  siege, added to the superhuman work he had there put upon himself, had  commenced the ruin of even his magnificent physique--a ruin the wild,  loose life he was now leading was soon to complete. It was a gloomy,  vaulted room that once had been a chapel, lighted dimly by a cheap,  evil-smelling lamp, heated to suffocation by one of those great  green-tiled German ovens now only to be met with in rare out-of-the-way  world corners. He was sitting propped up by pillows on the bed, placed  close to one of the high windows, his deep eyes flaring like two  gleaming caverns out of his drawn, haggard face.    “I saw you from the window,” he explained. “It is the only excitement  I get, twice a day when the sledges come in. I broke down coming across  the Pass a fortnight ago, on my way from Davos. We were stuck in a drift  for eighteen hours; it nearly finished my last lung. And I haven't even  a book to read. By God! lad, I was glad to see your frosted face ten  minutes ago in the light of the lantern.”    He grasped me with his long bony hand. “Sit down, and let me hear  my voice using again its mother tongue--you were always a good  listener--for the last eight years I have hardly spoken it. Can you  stand the room? The windows ought to be open, but what does it matter? I  may as well get accustomed to the heat before I die.”    I drew my chair close to the bed, and for awhile, between his fits  of coughing, we talked of things that were outside our thoughts, or,  rather, Hal talked, continuously, boisterously, meeting my remonstrances  with shouts of laughter, ending in wild struggles for breath, so that I  deemed it better to let him work his mad mood out.    Then suddenly: “What is she doing?” he asked. “Do you ever see her?”    “She is playing in--” I mentioned the name of a comic opera then running  in Paris. “No; I have not seen her for some time.”    He laid his white, wasted hand on mine. “What a pity you and I could not  have rolled ourselves into one, Paul--you, the saint, and I, the satyr.  Together we should have made her perfect lover.”    There came back to me the memory of those long nights when I had lain  awake listening to the angry voices of my father and mother soaking  through the flimsy wall. It seemed my fate to stand thus helpless  between those I loved, watching them hurting one another against their  will.    “Tell me,” I asked--“I loved her, knowing her: I was not blind. Whose  fault was it? Yours or hers?”    He laughed. “Whose fault, Paul? God made us.”    Thinking of her fair, sweet face, I hated him for his mocking laugh. But  the next moment, looking into his deep eyes, seeing the pain that dwelt  there, my pity was for him. A smile came to his ugly mouth.    “You have been on the stage, Paul; you must have heard the saying often:  'Ah, well, the curtain must come down, however badly things are going.'  It is only a play, Paul. We do not choose our parts. I did not even  know I was the villain, till I heard the booing of the gallery. I even  thought I was the hero, full of noble sentiment, sacrificing myself for  the happiness of the heroine. She would have married me in the beginning  had I plagued her sufficiently.”    I made to speak, but he interrupted me, continuing: “Ah, yes, it might  have been better. That is easy to say, not knowing. So, too, it might  have been worse--in all probability much the same. All roads lead to  the end. You know I was always a fatalist, Paul. We tried both ways. She  loved me well enough, but she loved the world also. I thought she  loved it better, so I kissed her on her brow, mumbled a prayer for her  happiness and made my exit to a choking sob. So ended the first act.  Wasn't I the hero throughout that, Paul? I thought so; slapped myself  upon the back, told myself what a fine fellow I had been. Then--you know  what followed. She was finer clay than she had fancied. Love is woman's  kingdom, not the world. Even then I thought more of her than of myself.  I could have borne my share of the burden had I not seen her fainting  under hers, shamed, degraded. So we dared to think for ourselves,  injuring nobody but ourselves, played the man and woman, lost the world  for love. Wasn't it brave, Paul? Were we not hero and heroine? They had  printed the playbill wrong, Paul, that was all. I was really the hero,  but the printing devil had made a slip, so instead of applauding you  booed. How could you know, any of you? It was not your fault.”    “But that was not the end,” I reminded him. “If the curtain had fallen  then, I could have forgiven you.”    He grinned. “That fatal last act. Even yours don't always come right, so  the critics tell me.”    The grin faded from his face. “We may never see each other again, Paul,”   he went on; “don't think too badly of me. I found I had made a second  mistake--or thought I had. She was no happier with me after a time than  she had been with him. If all our longings were one, life would be easy;  but they are not. What is to be done but toss for it? And if it come  down head we wish it had been tail, and if tail we think of what we have  lost through its not coming down head. Love is no more the whole of a  woman's life than it is of a man's. He did not apply for a divorce: that  was smart of him. We were shunned, ignored. To some women it might not  have mattered; but she had been used to being sought, courted, feted.  She made no complaint--did worse: made desperate effort to appear  cheerful, to pretend that our humdrum life was not boring her to death.  I watched her growing more listless, more depressed; grew angry with  her, angrier with myself. There was no bond between us except our  passion; that was real enough--'grand,' I believe, is the approved  literary adjective. It is good enough for what nature intended it, a  summer season in a cave. It makes but a poor marriage settlement in  these more complicated days. We fell to mutual recriminations, vulgar  scenes. Ah, most of us look better at a little distance from one  another. The sordid, contemptible side of life became important to us. I  was never rich; by contrast with all that she had known, miserably poor.  The mere sight of the food our twelve-pound-a-year cook put upon the  table would take away her appetite. Love does not change the palate,  give you a taste for cheap claret when you have been accustomed to dry  champagne. We have bodies to think of as well as souls; we are apt to  forget that in moments of excitement.    “She fell ill, and it seemed to me that I had dragged her from the soil  where she had grown only to watch her die. And then he came, precisely  at the right moment. I cannot help admiring him. Most men take their  revenge clumsily, hurting themselves; he was so neat, had been so  patient. I am not even ashamed of having fallen into his trap; it was  admirably baited. Maybe I had despised him for having seemed to submit  meekly to the blow. What cared he for me and my opinion? It was she was  all he cared for. He knew her better than I, knew that sooner or later  she would tire, not of love but of the cottage; look back with longing  eyes towards all that she had lost. Fool! Cuckold! What was it to him  that the world would laugh at him, despise him? Love such as his made  fools of men. Would I not give her back to him?    “By God! It was fine acting; half into the night we talked, I leaving  him every now and again to creep to the top of the stairs and listen to  her breathing. He asked me my advice, I being the hard-headed partner of  cool judgment. What would be the best way of approaching her after I was  gone? Where should he take her? How should they live till the nine days'  talk had died away? And I sat opposite to him--how he must have longed  to laugh in my silly face--advising him! We could not quite agree as  to details of a possible yachting cruise, and I remember hunting up an  atlas, and we pored over it, our heads close together. By God! I envy  him that night!”    He sank back on his pillows and laughed and coughed, and laughed and  coughed again, till I feared that wild, long, broken laugh would be his  last. But it ceased at length, and for awhile, exhausted, he lay silent  before continuing.    “Then came the question: how was I to go? She loved me still. He was  sure of it, and, for the matter of that, so was I. So long as she  thought that I loved her, she would never leave me. Only from her  despair could fresh hope arise for her. Would I not make some sacrifice  for her sake, persuade her that I had tired of her? Only by one means  could she be convinced. My going off alone would not suffice; my reason  for that she might suspect--she might follow. It would be for her sake.  Again it was the hero that I played, the dear old chuckle-headed hero,  Paul, that you ought to have cheered, not hooted. I loved her as much as  I ever loved her in my life, that night I left her. I took my boots  off in the passage and crept up in my stockinged feet. I told him I  was merely going to change my coat and put a few things into a bag. He  gripped my hand, and tears were standing in his eyes. It is odd that  suppressed laughter and expressed grief should both display the same  token, is it not? I stole into her room. I dared not kiss her for fear  of waking her; but a stray lock of her hair--you remember how long it  was--fell over the pillow, nearly reaching to the floor. I pressed my  lips against it, where it trailed over the bedstead, till they bled. I  have it still upon my lips, the mingling of the cold iron and the warm,  soft silken hair. He told me, when I came down again, that I had been  gone three-quarters of an hour. And we went out of the house together,  he and I. That is the last time I ever saw her.”    I leant across and put my arms around him; I suppose it was un-English;  there are times when one forgets these points. “I did not know! I did  not know,” I cried.    He pressed me to him with his feeble arms. “What a cad you must have  thought me, Paul,” he said. “But you might have given me credit for  better taste. I was always rather a gourmet than a gourmand where women  were concerned.”    “You have never seen him either again?” I asked.    “No,” he answered; “I swore to kill him when I learnt the trick he had  played me. He commenced the divorce proceedings against her the very  morning after I had left her. Possibly, had I succeeded in finding  him within the next six months, I should have done so. A few newspaper  proprietors would have been the only people really benefited. Time is  the cheapest Bravo; a little patience is all he charges. All roads lead  to the end, Paul.”    But I tell my tale badly, marring effects of sunlight with the memory  of shadows. At the time all promised fair. He was a handsome,  distinguished-looking man. Not every aristocrat, if without disrespect  to one's betters a humble observer may say so, suggests his title; this  man would have suggested his title, had he not possessed it. I suppose  he must have been about fifty at the time; but most men of thirty would  have been glad to exchange with him both figure and complexion. His  behaviour to his _fiancee_ was the essence of good taste, affectionate  devotion, carried to the exact point beyond which, having regard to the  disparity of their years, it would have appeared ridiculous. That he  sincerely admired her, was fully content with her, there could be no  doubt. I am even inclined to think he was fonder of her than, divining  her feelings towards himself, he cared to show. Knowledge of the world  must have told him that men of fifty find it easier to be the lovers of  women young enough to be their daughters, than girls find it to desire  the affection of men old enough to be their fathers; and he was not the  man to allow impulse to lead him into absurdity.    From my own peculiar point of view he appeared the ideal prince consort.  It was difficult for me to imagine my queen in love with any mere man.  This was one beside whom she could live, losing in my eyes nothing of  her dignity. My feelings for her he guessed at our first interview. Most  men in his position would have been amused, and many would have shown  it. For what reason I cannot say, but with a tact and courtesy that left  me only complimented, he drew from me, before I had met him half-a-dozen  times, more frank confession than a month previously I should have  dreamt of my yielding to anything than my own pillow. He laid his hand  upon my shoulder.    “I wonder if you know, my friend, how wise you are,” he said. “We all of  us at your age love an image of our own carving. Ah, if only we could be  content to worship the white, changeless statute! But we are fools. We  pray the gods to give her life, and under our hot kisses she becomes a  woman. I also loved when I was your age, Paul. Your countrymen, they  are so practical, they know only one kind of love. It is business-like,  rich--how puts it your poet? 'rich in saving common sense.' But there  are many kinds, you understand that, my friend. You are wise, do not  confuse them. She was a child of the mountains. I used to walk three  leagues to Mass each day to worship her. Had I been wise--had I so left  it, the memory of her would have coloured all my life with glory. But  I was a fool, my friend; I turned her into a woman. Ah!”--he made a  gesture of disgust--“such a fat, ugly woman, Paul, I turned her into. I  had much difficulty in getting rid of her. We should never touch things  in life that are beautiful; we have such clumsy hands, we spoil whatever  we touch.”    Hal did not return to England till the end of the year, by which time  the Count and Countess Huescar--though I had her permission still to  call her Barbara, I never availed myself of it; the “Countess” fitted my  mood better--had taken up residence in the grand Paris house old Hasluck  had bought for them.    It was the high-water mark of old Hasluck's career, and, if anything,  he was a little disappointed that with the dowry he had promised her  Barbara had not done even better for herself.    “Foreign Counts,” he grumbled to me laughingly, one day, “well, I hope  they're worth more in Society than they are in the City. A hundred  guineas is their price there, and they're not worth that. Who was that  American girl that married a Russian Prince only last week? A million  dollars was all she gave for him, and she a wholesale boot-maker's  daughter into the bargain! Our girls are not half as smart.”    But that was before he had seen his future son-in-law. After, he was  content enough, and up to the day of the wedding, childishly elated.  Under the Count's tuition he studied with reverential awe the Huescar  history. Princes, statesmen, warriors, glittered, golden apples, from  the spreading branches of its genealogical tree. Why not again! its  attenuated blue sap strengthened with the rich, red blood, brewed  by toil and effort in the grim laboratories of the under world. In  imagination, old Hasluck saw himself the grandfather of Chancellors, the  great-grandfather of Kings.    “I have laid the foundation, you shall raise the edifice,” so he told  her one evening I was spending with them, caressing her golden hair with  his blunt, fat fingers. “I am glad you were not a boy. A boy, in all  probability, would have squandered the money, let the name sink back  again into the gutter. And even had he been the other sort, he could  only have been another business man, keeping where I had left him.  You will call your first boy Hasluck, won't you? It must always be  the first-born's name. It shall be famous in the world yet, and for  something else than mere money.”    I began to understand the influences that had gone towards the  making--or marring--of Barbara's character. I had never guessed he had  cared for anything beyond money and the making of money.    It was, of course, a wedding as ostentatious as possible. Old Hasluck  knew how to advertise, and spared neither expense nor labour, with the  result that it was the event of the season, at least according to the  Society papers. Mrs. Hasluck was the type of woman to have escaped  observation, even had the wedding been her own; that she was present at  her daughter's, “becomingly dressed in grey veiling spotted white, with  an encrustation of mousseline de soie,” I learnt the next day from the  _Morning Post_. Old Hasluck himself had to be fetched every time he  was wanted. At the conclusion of the ceremony, seeking him, I found him  sitting on the stairs leading to the crypt.    “Is it over?” he asked. He was mopping his face on a huge handkerchief,  and had a small looking-glass in his hand.    “All over,” I answered, “they are waiting for you to start.”    “I always perspire so when I'm excited,” he explained. “Keep me out of  it as much as possible.”    But the next time I saw him, which was two or three days later, the  reaction had set in. He was sitting in his great library, surrounded  by books he would no more have thought of disturbing than he would of  strumming on the gorgeous grand piano inlaid with silver that ornamented  his drawing-room. A change had passed over him. His swelling rotundity,  suggestive generally of a bladder inflated to its extremest limits by  excess of self-importance, appeared to be shrinking. I put the idea  aside as mere fancy at the time, but it was fact; he became a mere bag  of bones before he died. He was wearing an old pair of carpet slippers  and smoking a short clay pipe.    “Well,” I said, “everything went off all right.”    “Everybody's gone off all right, so far,” he grunted. He was crouching  over the fire, though the weather was still warm, one hand spread  out towards the blaze. “Now I've got to go off, that's the only thing  they're waiting for. Then everything will be in order.”    “I don't think they are wanting you to go off,” I answered, with a  laugh.    “You mean,” he answered, “I'm the goose that lays the golden eggs. Ah,  but you see, so many of the eggs break, and so many of them are bad.”    “Some of them hatch all right,” I replied. The simile was becoming  somewhat confused: in conversation similes are apt to.    “If I were to die this week,” he said--he paused, completing mental  calculations, “I should be worth, roughly speaking, a couple of million.  This time next year I may be owing a million.”    I sat down opposite to him. “Why run risks?” I suggested. “Surely you  have enough. Why not give it up--retire?”    He laughed. “Do you think I haven't said that to myself, lad--sworn  I would a dozen times a year? I can't do it; I'm a gambler. It's the  earliest thing I can recollect doing, gambling with brace buttons. There  are men, Paul, now dying in the workhouse--men I once knew well; I think  of them sometimes, and wish I didn't--who any time during half their  life might have retired on twenty thousand a year. If I were to go to  any one of them, and settle an annuity of a hundred a year upon him, the  moment my back was turned he'd sell it out and totter up to Threadneedle  Street with the proceeds. It's in our blood. I shall gamble on my  death-bed, die with the tape in my hand.”    He kicked the fire into a blaze. A roaring flame made the room light  again.    “But that won't be just yet awhile,” he laughed, “and before it does,  I'll be the richest man in Europe. I keep my head cool--that's the  great secret.” Leaning over towards me, he sunk his voice to a whisper,  “Drink, Paul--so many of them drink. They get worried; fifty things  dancing round and round at the same time in their heads. Fifty questions  to be answered in five minutes. Tick, tick, tick, taps the little devil  at their elbow. This going down, that going up. Rumor of this, report  of that. A fortune to be lost here, a fortune to be snatched there.  Everything in a whirl! Tick, tick, tick, like nails into a coffin. God!  for five minutes' peace to think. Shut the door, turn the key. Out comes  the bottle. That's the end. All right so long as you keep away from  that. Cool, quick brain, clear judgment--that's the secret.”    “But is it worth it all?” I suggested. “Surely you have enough?”    “It means power, Paul.” He slapped his trousers pocket, making the  handful of gold and silver he always carried there jingle musically. “It  is this that rules the world. My children shall be big pots, hobnob  with kings and princes, slap them on the back and call them by their  Christian names, be kings themselves--why not? It's happened before.  My children, the children of old Noel Hasluck, son of a Whitechapel  butcher! Here's my pedigree!” Again be slapped his tuneful pocket.  “It's an older one than theirs! It's coming into its own at last! It's  money--we men of money--that are the true kings now. It's our family  that rules the world--the great money family; I mean to be its head.”    The blaze died out, leaving the room almost in darkness, and for awhile  we sat in silence.    “Quiet, isn't it?” said old Hasluck, raising his head.    The settling of the falling embers was the only sound about us.    “Guess we'll always be like this, now,” continued old Hasluck. “Old  woman goes to bed, you see, immediately after dinner. It used to be  different when _she_ was about. Somehow, the house and the lackeys and  all the rest of it seemed to be a more natural sort of thing when _she_  was the centre of it. It frightens the old woman now she's gone. She  likes to get away from it. Poor old Susan! A little country inn with  herself as landlady and me fussing about behind the bar; that was always  her ambition, poor old girl!”    “You will be visiting them,” I suggested, “and they will be coming to  stop with you.”    He shook his head. “They won't want me, and it isn't my game to hamper  them. I never mix out of my class. I've always had sense enough for  that.”    I laughed, wishing to cheer him, though I knew he was right. “Surely  your daughter belongs to your own class,” I replied.    “Do you think so?” he asked, with a grin. “That's not a pretty  compliment to her. She was my child when she used to cling round my  neck, while I made the sausages, calling me her dear old pig. It didn't  trouble her then that I dropped my aitches and had a greasy skin. I was  a Whitechapel butcher, and she was a Whitechapel brat. I could have kept  her if I'd liked, but I was set upon making a lady of her, and I did it.  But I lost my child. Every time she came back from school I could see  she despised me a little more. I'm not blaming her; how could she help  it? I was making a lady of her, teaching her to do it; though there were  moments when I almost hated her, felt tempted to snatch her back to me,  drag her down again to my level, make her my child again, before it was  too late. Oh, it wasn't all unselfishness; I could have done it. She  would have remained my class then, would have married my class, and her  children would have been my class. I didn't want that. Everything's got  to be paid for. I got what I asked for; I'm not grumbling at the price.  But it ain't cheap.”    He rose and knocked the ashes from his pipe. “Ring the bell, Paul, will  you?” he said. “Let's have some light and something to drink. Don't take  any notice of me. I've got the hump to-night.”    It was a minute or two before the lamp came. He put his arm upon my  shoulder, leaning upon me somewhat heavily.    “I used to fancy sometimes, Paul,” he said, “that you and she might have  made a match of it. I should have been disappointed for some things. But  you'd have been a bit nearer to me, you two. It never occurred to you,  that, I suppose?”        CHAPTER VII.    HOW PAUL SET FORTH UPON A QUEST.    Of old Deleglise's Sunday suppers, which, costumed from head to foot  in spotless linen, he cooked himself in his great kitchen, moving with  flushed, earnest face about the gleaming stove, while behind him his  guests waited, ranged round the massive oaken table glittering with cut  glass and silver, among which fluttered the deft hands of Madeline, his  ancient whitecapped Bonne, much has been already recorded, and by those  possessed of greater knowledge. They who sat there talking in whispers  until such time as old Deleglise turned towards them again, radiant  with consciousness of success, the savoury triumph steaming between his  hands, when, like the sudden swell of the Moonlight Sonata, the talk  would rush once more into a roar, were men whose names were  then--and some are still--more or less household words throughout the  English-speaking world. Artists, musicians, actors, writers, scholars,  droles, their wit and wisdom, their sayings and their doings must be  tolerably familiar to readers of memoir and biography; and if to such  their epigrams appear less brilliant, their jests less laughable than to  us who heard them spoken, that is merely because fashion in humour and  in understanding changes as in all else.    You, gentle reader of my book, I shall not trouble with second-hand  record of that which you can read elsewhere. For me it will be but  to write briefly of my own brief glimpse into that charmed circle.  Concerning this story more are the afternoon At Homes held by Dan and  myself upon the second floor of the old Georgian house in pleasant,  quiet Queen Square. For cook and house-maid on these days it would be a  busy morning. Failing other supervision, Dan and I agreed that to secure  success on these important occasions each of us should criticise the  work of the other. I passed judgment on Dan's cooking, he upon my  house-work.    “Too much soda,” I would declare, sampling the cake.    “You silly Juggins! It's meant to taste of soda--it's a soda cake.”    “I know that. It isn't meant to taste of nothing but soda. There  wants to be some cake about it also. This thing, so far as flavour  is concerned, is nothing but a Seidlitz powder. You can't give people  solidified Seidlitz powders for tea!”    Dan would fume, but I would remain firm. The soda cake would be laid  aside, and something else attempted. His cookery was the one thing Dan  was obstinate about. He would never admit that anything could possibly  be wrong with it. His most ghastly failures he would devour himself  later on with pretended enjoyment. I have known him finish a sponge  cake, the centre of which had to be eaten with a teaspoon, declaring it  was delicious; that eating a dry sponge cake was like eating dust; that  a sponge cake ought to be a trifle syrupy towards the centre. Afterwards  he would be strangely silent and drink brandy out of a wine-glass.    “Call these knives clean?” It would be Dan's turn.    “Yes, I do.”    Dan would draw his finger across one, producing chiaro-oscuro.    “Not if you go fingering them. Why don't you leave them alone and go on  with your own work?”    “You've just wiped them, that's all.”    “Well, there isn't any knife-powder.”    “Yes, there is.”    “Besides, it ruins knives, over-cleaning them--takes all the edge off.  We shall want them pretty sharp to cut those lemon buns of yours.”    “Over-cleaning them! You don't take any pride in the place.”    “Good Lord! Don't I work from morning to night?”    “You lazy young devil!”    “Makes one lazy, your cooking. How can a man work when he is suffering  all day long from indigestion?”    But Dan would not be content until I had found the board and cleaned the  knives to his complete satisfaction. Perhaps it was as well that in this  way all things once a week were set in order. After lunch house-maid and  cook would vanish, two carefully dressed gentlemen being left alone to  receive their guests.    These would be gathered generally from among Dan's journalistic  acquaintances and my companions of the theatre. Occasionally, Minikin  and Jarman would be of the number, Mrs. Peedles even once or twice  arriving breathless on our landing. Left to myself, I perhaps should not  have invited them, deeming them hardly fitting company to mingle with  our other visitors; but Dan, having once been introduced to them,  overrode such objection.    “My dear Lord Chamberlain,” Dan would reply, “an ounce of originality is  worth a ton of convention. Little tin ladies and gentlemen all made  to pattern! One can find them everywhere. Your friends would be an  acquisition to any society.”    “But are they quite good form?” I hinted.    “I'll tell you what we will do,” replied Dan. “We'll forget that Mrs.  Peedles keeps a lodging-house in Blackfriars. We will speak of her as  our friend, 'that dear, quaint old creature, Lady P.' A title that is  an oddity, whose costume always suggests the wardrobe of a provincial  actress! My dear Paul, your society novelist would make a fortune out  of such a character. The personages of her amusing anecdotes, instead of  being third-rate theatrical folk, shall be Earl Blank and the Baroness  de Dash. The editors of society journals shall pay me a shilling a  line for them. Jarman--yes, Jarman shall be the son of a South American  millionaire. Vulgar? Nonsense! you mean racy. Minikin--he looks much  more like forty than twenty--he shall be an eminent scientist. His  head will then appear the natural size; his glass eye, the result of  a chemical experiment, a touch of distinction; his uncompromising  rudeness, a lovable characteristic. We will make him buy a yard of  red ribbon and wear it across his shirt-front, and address him as Herr  Professor. It will explain slight errors of English grammar and all  peculiarities of accent. They shall be our lions. You leave it to me. We  will invite commonplace, middle-class folk to meet them.”    And this, to my terror and alarm, Dan persisted in doing. Jarman entered  into the spirit of the joke with gusto. So far as he was concerned, our  guests, from the beginning to the end, were one and all, I am confident,  deceived. The more he swaggered, the more he boasted, the more he talked  about himself--and it was a failing he was prone to--the greater was  his success. At the persistent endeavours of Dan's journalistic  acquaintances to excite his cupidity by visions of new journals, to be  started with a mere couple of thousand pounds and by the inherent  merit of their ideas to command at once a circulation of hundreds of  thousands, I could afford to laugh. But watching the tremendous efforts  of my actress friends to fascinate him--luring him into corners, gazing  at him with languishing eyes, trotting out all their little tricks  for his exclusive benefit, quarrelling about him among themselves--my  conscience would prick me, lest our jest should end in a contretemps.  Fortunately, Jarman himself, was a gentleman of uncommon sense, or my  fears might have been realised. I should have been sorry myself to have  been asked to remain stone under the blandishments of girls young and  old, of women handsome and once, no doubt, good looking, showered upon  him during that winter. But Jarman, as I think I have explained, was no  slave to female charms. He enjoyed his good time while it lasted, and  eventually married the eldest daughter of a small blacking factory. She  was a plain girl, but pleasant, and later brought to Jarman possession  of the factory. When I meet him--he is now stout and rubicund--he gives  me the idea of a man who has attained to his ideals.    With Minikin we had more trouble. People turned up possessed of  scientific smattering. We had to explain that the Professor never talked  shop. Others were owners of unexpected knowledge of German, which they  insisted upon airing. We had to explain that the Herr Professor was  in London to learn English, and had taken a vow during his residence  neither to speak nor listen to his native tongue. It was remarked that  his acquaintance with colloquial English slang, for a foreigner, was  quite unusual. Occasionally he was too rude, even for a scientist,  informing ladies, clamouring to know how he liked English women, that he  didn't like them silly; telling one gentleman, a friend of Dan, a rather  important man who once asked him, referring to his yard of ribbon, what  he got it for, that he got it for fourpence. We had to explain him as  a gentleman who had been soured by a love disappointment. The ladies  forgave him; the gentlemen said it was a damned lucky thing for the  girl. Altogether, Minikin took a good deal of explaining.    Lady Peedles, our guests decided among themselves, must be the widow of  some one in the City who had been knighted in a crowd. They made fun of  her behind her back, but to her face were most effusive. “My dear Lady  Peedles” was the phrase most often heard in our rooms whenever she was  present. At the theatre “my friend Lady Peedles” became a person much  spoken of--generally in loud tones. My own social position I found  decidedly improved by reason of her ladyship's evident liking for  myself. It went abroad that I was her presumptive heir. I was courted as  a gentleman of expectations.    The fishy-eyed young man became one of our regular guests. Dan won his  heart by never laughing at him.    “I like talking to you,” said the fishy-eyed young man one afternoon to  Dan. “You don't go into fits of laughter when I remark that it has been  a fine day; most people do. Of course, on the stage I don't mind. I  know I am a funny little devil. I get my living by being a funny little  devil. There is a photograph of me hanging in the theatre lobby. I saw  a workman stop and look at it the other day as he passed; I was just  behind him. He burst into a roar of laughter. 'Little--! He makes me  laugh to look at him!' he cluttered to himself. Well, that's all right;  I want the man in the gallery to think me funny, but it annoys me when  people laugh at me off the stage. If I am out to dinner anywhere and ask  somebody to pass the mustard, I never get it; instead, they burst out  laughing. I don't want people to laugh at me when I am having my dinner.  I want my dinner. It makes me very angry sometimes.”    “I know,” agreed Dan, sympathetically. “The world never grasps the fact  that man is a collection, not a single exhibit. I remember being at a  house once where the chief guest happened to be a great Hebrew scholar.  One tea time, a Miss Henman, passing the butter to some one in a hurry,  let it slip out of her hand. 'Why is Miss Henman like a caterpillar?'  asked our learned guest in a sepulchral voice. Nobody appeared to know.  'Because she makes the butter fly.' It never occurred to any one of us  that the Doctor could possibly joke. There was dead silence for about  a minute. Then our hostess, looking grave, remarked: 'Oh, do you really  think so?'”    “If I were to enter a room full of people,” said the fishy-eyed young  man, “and tell them that my mother had been run over by an omnibus, they  would think it the funniest story they had heard in years.”    He was playing a principal part now in the opera, and it was he  undoubtedly who was drawing the house. But he was not happy.    “I am not a comic actor, really,” he explained. “I could play Romeo, so  far as feeling is concerned, and play it damned well. There is a fine  vein of poetry in me. But of course it's no good to me with this face of  mine.”    “But are you not sinning your mercies, you fellows?” Dan replied. “There  is young Kelver here. At school it was always his trouble that he could  give us a good time and make us laugh, which nobody else in the whole  school could do. His ambition was to kick a ball as well as a hundred  other fellows could kick it. He could tell us a good story now if he  would only write what the Almighty intended him to write, instead of  gloomy rigmaroles about suffering Princesses in Welsh caves. I don't  say it's bad, but a hundred others could write the same sort of thing  better.”    “Can't you understand,” answered the little man; “the poorest tragedian  that ever lived never wished himself the best of low comedians. The  court fool had an excellent salary, no doubt; and, likely enough, had  got two-thirds of all the brain there was in the palace. But not a  wooden-headed man-at-arms but looked down upon him. Every gallery boy  who pays a shilling to laugh at me regards himself as my intellectual  superior; while to a fourth-rate spouter of blank verse he looks up in  admiration.”    “Does it so very much matter,” suggested Dan, “how the wooden-headed  man-at-arms or the shilling gallery boy happens to regard you?”    “Yes, it does,” retorted Goggles, “because we happen to agree with them.  If I could earn five pounds a week as juvenile lead, I would never play  a comic part again.”    “There I cannot follow you,” returned Dan. “I can understand the artist  who would rather be the man of action, the poet who would rather be the  statesman or the warrior; though personally my sympathies are precisely  the other way--with Wolfe who thought it a more glorious work, the  writing of a great poem, than the burning of so many cities and the  killing of so many men. We all serve the community. It is difficult,  looking at the matter from the inside, to say who serves it best. Some  feed it, some clothe it. The churchman and the policeman between them  look after its morals, keep it in order. The doctor mends it when it  injures itself; the lawyer helps it to quarrel, the soldier teaches it  to fight. We Bohemians amuse it, instruct it. We can argue that we are  the most important. The others cater for its body, we for its mind. But  their work is more showy than ours and attracts more attention; and to  attract attention is the aim and object of most of us. But for Bohemians  to worry among themselves which is the greatest, is utterly without  reason. The story-teller, the musician, the artist, the clown, we are  members of a sharing troupe; one, with the ambition of the fat boy in  Pickwick, makes the people's flesh creep; another makes them hold their  sides with laughter. The tragedian, soliloquising on his crimes, shows  us how wicked we are; you, looking at a pair of lovers from under a  scratch wig, show us how ridiculous we are. Both lessons are necessary:  who shall say which is the superior teacher?”    “Ah, I am not a philosopher,” replied the little man, with a sigh.    “Ah,” returned Dan, with another, “and I am not a comic actor on my  way to a salary of a hundred a week. We all of us want the other boy's  cake.”    The O'Kelly was another frequent visitor of ours. The attic in Belsize  Square had been closed. In vain had the O'Kelly wafted incense, burned  pastilles and sprinkled eau-de-Cologne. In vain had he talked of rats,  hinted at drains.    “A wonderful woman,” groaned the O'Kelly in tones of sorrowful  admiration. “There's no deceiving her.”    “But why submit?” was our natural argument. “Why not say you are going  to smoke, and do it?”    “It's her theory, me boy,” explained the O'Kelly, “that the home should  be kept pure--a sort of a temple, ye know. She's convinced that in time  it is bound to exercise an influence upon me. It's a beautiful idea,  when ye come to think of it.”    Meanwhile, in the rooms of half-a-dozen sinful men the O'Kelly kept his  own particular pipe, together with his own particular smoking mixture;  and one such pipe and one such tobacco jar stood always on our  mantelpiece.    In the spring the forces of temptation raged round that feeble but most  excellently intentioned citadel, the O'Kelly's conscience. The Signora  had returned to England, was performing then at Ashley's Theatre. The  O'Kelly would remain under long spells of silence, puffing vigorously  at his pipe. Or would fortify himself with paeans in praise of Mrs.  O'Kelly.    “If anything could ever make a model man of me”--he spoke in the tones  of one whose doubts are stronger than his hopes--“it would be the  example of that woman.”    It was one Saturday afternoon. I had just returned from the matinee.    “I don't believe,” continued the O'Kelly, “I don't really believe she  has ever done one single thing she oughtn't to, or left undone one  single thing she ought, in the whole course of her life.”    “Maybe she has, and you don't know of it,” I suggested, perceiving the  idea might comfort him.    “I wish I could think so,” returned the O'Kelly. “I don't mean anything  really wrong,” he corrected himself quickly, “but something just a  little wrong. I feel--I really feel I should like her better if she  had.”    “Not that I mean I don't like her as it is, ye understand,” corrected  himself the O'Kelly a second time. “I respect that woman--I cannot tell  ye, me boy, how much I respect her. Ye don't know her. There was one  morning, about a month ago. That woman--she's down at six every morning,  summer and winter; we have prayers at half-past. I was a trifle late  meself: it was never me strong point, as ye know, early rising. Seven  o'clock struck; she didn't appear, and I thought she had overslept  herself. I won't say I didn't feel pleased for the moment; it was an  unworthy sentiment, but I almost wished she had. I ran up to her room.  The door was open, the bedclothes folded down as she always leaves them.  She came in five minutes later. She had got up at four that morning  to welcome a troupe of native missionaries from East Africa on their  arrival at Waterloo Station. She's a saint, that woman; I am not worthy  of her.”    “I shouldn't dwell too much on that phase of the subject,” I suggested.    “I can't help it, me boy,” replied the O'Kelly. “I feel I am not.”    “I don't for a moment say you are,” I returned; “but I shouldn't harp  upon the idea. I don't think it good for you.”    “I never will be,” he persisted gloomily, “never!”    Evidently he was started on a dangerous train of reflection. With the  idea of luring him away from it, I led the conversation to the subject  of champagne.    “Most people like it dry,” admitted the O'Kelly. “Meself, I have always  preferred it with just a suggestion of fruitiness.”    “There was a champagne,” I said, “you used to be rather fond of when  we--years ago.”    “I think I know the one ye mean,” said the O'Kelly. “It wasn't at all  bad, considering the price.”    “You don't happen to remember where you got it?” I asked.    “It was in Bridge Street,” remembered the O'Kelly, “not so very far from  the Circus.”    “It is a pleasant evening,” I remarked; “let us take a walk.”    We found the place, half wine-shop, half office.    “Just the same,” commented the O'Kelly as we pushed open the door and  entered. “Not altered a bit.”    As in all probability barely twelve months had elapsed since his last  visit, the fact in itself was not surprising. Clearly the O'Kelly had  been calculating time rather by sensation. I ordered a bottle; and we  sat down. Myself, being prejudiced against the brand, I called for a  glass of claret. The O'Kelly finished the bottle. I was glad to notice  my ruse had been successful. The virtue of that wine had not departed  from it. With every glass the O'Kelly became morally more elevated.  He left the place, determined that he would be worthy of Mrs. O'Kelly.  Walking down the Embankment, he asserted his determination of buying an  alarm-clock that very evening. At the corner of Westminster Bridge he  became suddenly absorbed in his own thoughts. Looking to discover the  cause of his silence, I saw that his eyes were resting on a poster  representing a charming lady standing on one leg upon a wire; below  her--at some distance--appeared the peaks of mountains; the artist  had even caught the likeness. I cursed the luck that had directed our  footsteps, but the next moment, lacking experience, was inclined to be  reassured.    “Me dear Paul,” said the O'Kelly--he laid a fatherly hand upon my  shoulder--“there are fair-faced, laughing women--sweet creatures,  that ye want to put yer arm around and dance with.” He shook his head  disapprovingly. “There are the sainted women, who lead us up, Paul--up,  always up.”    A look, such as the young man with the banner might have borne with him  to the fields of snow and ice, suffused the O'Kelly's handsome face.  Without another word he crossed the road and entered an American store,  where for six-and-elevenpence he purchased an alarm-clock the man  assured us would awake an Egyptian mummy. With this in his hand he waved  me a good-bye, and jumped upon a Hampstead 'bus, and alone I strolled on  to the theatre.    Hal returned a little after Christmas and started himself in chambers  in the City. It was the nearest he dared venture, so he said, to  civilisation.    “I'd be no good in the West End,” he explained. “For a season I might  attract as an eccentricity, but your swells would never stand me for  longer--no more would any respectable folk, anywhere: we don't get on  together. I commenced at Richmond. It was a fashionable suburb then,  and I thought I was going to do wonders. I had everything in my favour,  except myself. I do know my work, nobody can deny that of me. My  father spent every penny he had, poor gentleman, in buying me an  old-established practice: fine house, carriage and pair, white-haired  butler--everything correct, except myself. It was of no use. I can hold  myself in for a month or two; then I break out, the old original savage  that I am under my frock coat. I feel I must run amuck, stabbing,  hacking at the prim, smiling Lies mincing round about me. I can fool a  silly woman for half-a-dozen visits; bow and rub my hands, purr round  her sympathetically. All the while I am longing to tell her the truth:    “'Go home. Wash your face; don't block up the pores of your skin with  paint. Let out your corsets. You are thirty-three round the abdomen if  you are an inch: how can you expect your digestion to do its work when  you're squeezing it into twenty-one? Give up gadding about half your day  and most of your night; you are old enough to have done with that sort  of thing. Let the children come, and suckle them yourself. You'll be all  the better for them. Don't loll in bed all the morning. Get up like a  decent animal and do something for your living. Use your brain, what  there is of it, and your body. At that price you can have health  to-morrow, and at no other. I can do nothing for you.'    “And sooner or later I blurt it out.” He laughed his great roar. “Lord!  you should see the real face coming out of the simpering mask.    “Pompous old fools, strutting into me like turkey-cocks! By Jove, it was  worth it! They would dribble out, looking half their proper size after I  had done telling them what was the matter with them.    “'Do you want to know what you are really suffering from?' I would shout  at them, when I could contain myself no longer. 'Gluttony, my dear sir;  gluttony and drunkenness, and over-indulgence in other vices that shall  be nameless. Live like a man; get a little self-respect from somewhere;  give up being an ape. Treat your body properly and it will treat you  properly. That's the only prescription that will do you any good.'”    He laughed again. “'Tell the truth, you shame the Devil.' But the Devil  replies by starving you. It's a fairly effective retort. I am not the  stuff successful family physicians are made of. In the City I may manage  to rub along. One doesn't see so much of one's patients; they come and  go. Clerks and warehousemen my practice will be among chiefly. The poor  man does not so much mind being told the truth about himself; it is a  blessing to which he is accustomed.”    We spoke but once of Barbara. A photograph of her in her bride's  dress stood upon my desk. Occasionally, first fitting the room for  the ceremony, sweeping away all impurity even from under the mats, and  dressing myself with care, I would centre it amid flowers, and kneeling,  kiss her hand where it rested on the back of the top-heavy looking chair  without which no photographic studio is complete.    One day he took it up, and looked at it long and hard.    “The forehead denotes intellectuality; the eyes tenderness and courage.  The lower part of the face, on the other hand, suggests a good deal  of animalism: the finely cut nostrils show egotism--another word for  selfishness; the nose itself, vanity; the lips, sensuousness and love  of luxury. I wonder what sort of woman she really is.” He laid the  photograph back upon the desk.    “I did not know you were so firm a believer in Lavater,” I said.    “Only when he agrees with what I know,” he answered. “Have I not  described her rightly?”    “I do not care to discuss her in that vein,” I replied, feeling the  blood mounting to my cheeks.    “Too sacred a subject?” he laughed. “It is the one ingredient of manhood  I lack, ideality--an unfortunate deficiency for me. I must probe,  analyse, dissect, see the thing as it really is, know it for what it  is.”    “Well, she is the Countess Huescar now,” I said. “For God's sake, leave  her alone.”    He turned to me with the snarl of a beast. “How do you know she is the  Countess Huescar? Is it a special breed of woman made on purpose? How do  you know she isn't my wife--brain and heart, flesh and blood, mine? If  she was, do you think I should give her up because some fool has stuck  his label on her?”    I felt the anger burning in my eyes. “Yours, his! She is no man's  property. She is herself,” I cried.    The wrinkles round his nose and mouth smoothed themselves out. “You need  not be afraid,” he sneered. “As you say, she is the Countess Huescar.  Can you imagine her as Mrs. Doctor Washburn? I can't.” He took her  photograph in his hand again. “The lower part of the face is the true  index to the character. It shows the animal, and it is the animal that  rules. The soul, the intellect, it comes and goes; the animal remains  always. Sensuousness, love of luxury, vanity, those are the strings to  which she dances. To be a Countess is of more importance to her than to  be a woman. She is his, not mine. Let him keep her.”    “You do not know her,” I answered; “you never have. You listen to what  she says. She does not know herself.”    He looked at me queerly. “What do you think her to be?” he asked me. “A  true woman, not the shallow thing she seems?”    “A true woman,” I persisted stoutly, “that you have not eyes enough to  see.”    “You little fool!” he muttered, with the same queer look--“you little  fool. But let us hope you are wrong, Paul. Let us hope, for her sake,  you are wrong.”    It was at one of Deleglise's Sunday suppers that I first met Urban Vane.  The position, nor even the character, I fear it must be confessed, of  his guests was never enquired into by old Deleglise. A simple-minded,  kindly old fellow himself, it was his fate to be occasionally surprised  and grieved at the discovery that even the most entertaining of supper  companions could fall short of the highest standard of conventional  morality.    “Dear, dear me!” he would complain, pacing up and down his studio  with puzzled visage. “The last man in the world of whom I should have  expected to hear it. So original in all his ideas. Are you quite sure?”    “I am afraid there can be no doubt about it.”    “I can't believe it! I really can't believe it! One of the most amusing  men I ever met!”    I remember a well-known artist one evening telling us with much sense of  humour how he had just completed the sale of an old Spanish cabinet to  two distinct and separate purchasers.    “I sold it first,” recounted the little gentleman with glee, “to old  Jong, the dealer. He has been worrying me about it for the last three  months, and on Saturday afternoon, hearing that I was clearing out  and going abroad, he came round again. 'Well, I am not sure I am in a  position to sell it,' I told him. 'Who'll know?' he asked. 'They are not  in, are they?' 'Not yet,' I answered, 'but I expect they will be some  time on Monday.' 'Tell your man to open the door to me at eight o'clock  on Monday morning,' he replied, 'we'll have it away without any fuss.  There needn't be any receipt. I'm lending you a hundred pounds, in  cash.' I worked him up to a hundred and twenty, and he paid me. Upon my  word, I should never have thought of it, if he hadn't put the idea into  my head. But turning round at the door: 'You won't go and sell it to  some one else,' he suggested, 'between now and Monday?' It serves him  right for his damned impertinence. 'Send and take it away to-day if you  are at all nervous,' I told him. He looked at the thing, it is about  twelve feet high altogether. 'I would if I could get a cart,' he  muttered. Then an idea struck him. 'Does the top come off?' 'See for  yourself,' I answered; 'it's your cabinet, not mine.' I was feeling  rather annoyed with him. He examined it. 'That's all right,' he said;  'merely a couple of screws. I'll take the top with me now on my cab.'  He got a man in, and they took the upper cupboard away, leaving me the  bottom. Two hours later old Sir George called to see me about his wife's  portrait. The first thing he set eyes on was the remains of the cabinet:  he had always admired it. 'Hallo,' he asked, 'are you breaking up the  studio literally? What have you done with the other half?' 'I've sent  it round to Jong's--' He didn't give me time to finish. 'Save Jong's  commission and sell it to me direct,' he said. 'We won't argue about the  price and I'll pay you in cash.'    “Well, if Providence comes forward and insists on taking charge of  a man, it is hardly good manners to flout her. Besides, his wife's  portrait is worth twice as much as he is paying for it. He handed me  over the money in notes. 'Things not going quite smoothly with you just  at the moment?' he asked me. 'Oh, about the same as usual,' I told him.  'You won't be offended at my taking it away with me this evening?' he  asked. 'Not in the least,' I answered; 'you'll get it on the top of a  four-wheeled cab.' We called in a couple of men, and I helped them down  with it, and confoundedly heavy it was. 'I shall send round to Jong's  for the other half on Monday morning,' he said, speaking with his head  through the cab window, 'and explain it to him.' 'Do,' I answered;  'he'll understand.'    “I'm sorry I'm going away so early in the morning,” concluded the little  gentleman. “I'd give back Jong ten per cent. of his money to see his  face when he enters the studio.”    Everybody laughed; but after the little gentleman was gone, the subject  cropped up again.    “If I wake sufficiently early,” remarked one, “I shall find an excuse  to look in myself at eight o'clock. Jong's face will certainly be worth  seeing.”    “Rather rough both on him and Sir George,” observed another.    “Oh, he hasn't really done anything of the kind,” chimed in old  Deleglise in his rich, sweet voice. “He made that all up. It's just his  fun; he's full of humour.”    “I am inclined to think that would be his idea of a joke,” asserted the  first speaker.    Old Deleglise would not hear of it; but a week or two later I noticed an  addition to old Deleglise's studio furniture in the shape of a handsome  old carved cabinet twelve feet high.    “He really had done it,” explained old Deleglise, speaking in a whisper,  though only he and I were present. “Of course, it was only his fun; but  it might have been misunderstood. I thought it better to put the thing  straight. I shall get the money back from him when he returns. A most  amusing little man!”    Old Deleglise possessed a house in Gower Street which fell vacant. One  of his guests, a writer of poetical drama, was a man who three months  after he had earned a thousand pounds never had a penny with which  to bless himself. They are dying out, these careless, good-natured,  conscienceless Bohemians; but quarter of a century ago they still  lingered in Alsatian London. Turned out of his lodgings by a Philistine  landlord, his sole possession in the wide world, two acts of a drama,  for which he had already been paid, the problem of his future, though  it troubled him but little, became acute to his friends. Old Deleglise,  treating the matter as a joke, pretending not to know who was the  landlord, suggested he should apply to the agents for position as  caretaker. Some furniture was found for him, and the empty house in  Gower Street became his shelter. The immediate present thus provided  for, kindly old Deleglise worried himself a good deal concerning what  would become of his friend when the house was let. There appeared to be  no need for worry. Weeks, months went by. Applications were received  by the agents in fair number, view cards signed by the dozen; but  prospective tenants were never seen again. One Sunday evening our poet,  warmed by old Deleglise's Burgundy, forgetful whose recommendation  had secured him the lowly but timely appointment, himself revealed the  secret.    “Most convenient place I've got,” so he told old Deleglise. “Whole house  to myself. I wander about; it just suits me.”    “I'm glad to hear that,” murmured old Deleglise.    “Come and see me, and I'll cook you a chop,” continued the other. “I've  had the kitchen range brought up into the back drawing-room; saves going  up and down stairs.”    “The devil you have!” growled old Deleglise. “What do you think the  owner of the house will say?”    “Haven't the least idea who the poor old duffer is myself. They've put  me in as caretaker--an excellent arrangement: avoids all argument about  rent.”    “Afraid it will soon come to an end, that excellent arrangement;”   remarked old Deleglise, drily.    “Why? Why should it?”    “A house in Gower Street oughtn't to remain vacant long.”    “This one will.”    “You might tell me,” asked old Deleglise, with a grim smile; “how do you  manage it? What happens when people come to look over the house--don't  you let them in?”    “I tried that at first,” explained the poet, “but they would go on  knocking, and boys and policemen passing would stop and help them. It  got to be a nuisance; so now I have them in, and get the thing over.  I show them the room where the murder was committed. If it's a  nervous-looking party, I let them off with a brief summary. If that  doesn't do, I go into details and show them the blood-spots on the  floor. It's an interesting story of the gruesome order. Come round one  morning and I'll tell it to you. I'm rather proud of it. With the blinds  down and a clock in the next room that ticks loudly, it goes well.”    Yet this was a man who, were the merest acquaintance to call upon him  and ask for his assistance, would at once take him by the arm and lead  him upstairs. All notes and cheques that came into his hands he changed  at once into gold. Into some attic half filled with lumber he would  fling it by the handful; then, locking the door, leave it there. On  their hands and knees he and his friends, when they wanted any, would  grovel for it, poking into corners, hunting under boxes, groping among  broken furniture, feeling between cracks and crevices. Nothing gave him  greater delight than an expedition of this nature to what he termed his  gold-field; it had for him, as he would explain, all the excitements  of mining without the inconvenience and the distance. He never knew how  much was there. For a certain period a pocketful could be picked up in  five minutes. Then he would entertain a dozen men at one of the best  restaurants in London, tip cabmen and waiters with half-sovereigns,  shower half-crowns as he walked through the streets, lend or give to  anybody for the asking. Later, half-an-hour's dusty search would be  rewarded with a single coin. It made no difference to him; he would dine  in Soho for eighteenpence, smoke shag, and run into debt.    The red-haired man, to whom Deleglise had introduced me on the day of  my first meeting with the Lady of the train, was another of his most  constant visitors. It flattered my vanity that the red-haired man, whose  name was famous throughout Europe and America, should condescend to  confide to me--as he did and at some length--the deepest secrets of his  bosom. Awed--at all events at first--I would sit and listen while by  the hour he would talk to me in corners, telling me of the women he had  loved. They formed a somewhat large collection. Julias, Marias, Janets,  even Janes--he had madly worshipped, deliriously adored so many it grew  bewildering. With a far-away look in his eyes, pain trembling through  each note of his musical, soft voice, he would with bitter jest, with  passionate outburst, recount how he had sobbed beneath the stars for  love of Isabel, bitten his own flesh in frenzied yearning for Lenore. He  appeared from his own account--if in connection with a theme so poetical  I may be allowed a commonplace expression--to have had no luck with  any of them. Of the remainder, an appreciable percentage had been mere  passing visions, seen at a distance in the dawn, at twilight--generally  speaking, when the light must have been uncertain. Never again, though  he had wandered in the neighbourhood for months, had he succeeded in  meeting them. It would occur to me that enquiries among the neighbours,  applications to the local police, might possibly have been efficacious;  but to have broken in upon his exalted mood with such suggestions would  have demanded more nerve than at the time I possessed. In consequence,  my thoughts I kept to myself.    “My God, boy!” he would conclude, “may you never love as I loved that  woman Miriam”--or Henrietta, or Irene, as the case might be.    For my sympathetic attitude towards the red-haired man I received one  evening commendation from old Deleglise.    “Good boy,” said old Deleglise, laying his hand on my shoulder. We were  standing in the passage. We had just shaken hands with the red-haired  man, who, as usual, had been the last to leave. “None of the others will  listen to him. He used to stop and confide it all to me after everybody  else had gone. Sometimes I have dropped asleep, to wake an hour later  and find him still talking. He gets it over early now. Good boy!”    Soon I learnt it was characteristic of the artist to be willing--nay,  anxious, to confide his private affairs to any one and every one who  would only listen. Another characteristic appeared to be determination  not to listen to anybody else's. As attentive recipient of other  people's troubles and emotions I was subjected to practically no  competition whatever. One gentleman, a leading actor of that day, I  remember, immediately took me aside on my being introduced to him, and  consulted me as to his best course of procedure under the extremely  painful conditions that had lately arisen between himself and his wife.  We discussed the unfortunate position at some length, and I did my best  to counsel fairly and impartially.    “I wish you would lunch with me at White's to-morrow,” he said. “We can  talk it over quietly. Say half-past one. By the bye, I didn't catch your  name.”    I spelt it to him: he wrote the appointment down on his shirt-cuff. I  went to White's the next day and waited an hour, but he did not turn  up. I met him three weeks later at a garden-party with his wife. But he  appeared to have forgotten me.    Observing old Deleglise's guests, comparing them with their names, it  surprised me the disconnection between the worker and the work. Writers  of noble sentiment, of elevated ideality, I found contained in men of  commonplace appearance, of gross appetites, of conventional ideas.  It seemed doubtful whether they fully comprehended their own work;  certainly it had no effect upon their own lives. On the other hand, an  innocent, boyish young man, who lived the most correct of lives with  a girlish-looking wife in an ivy-covered cottage near Barnes Common,  I discovered to be the writer of decadent stories at which the Empress  Theodora might have blushed. The men whose names were widest known were  not the men who shone the brightest in Deleglise's kitchen; more  often they appeared the dull dogs, listening enviously, or failing  pathetically when they tried to compete with others who to the public  were comparatively unknown. After a time I ceased to confound the artist  with the man, thought no more of judging the one by the other than of  evolving a tenant from the house to which circumstances or carelessness  might have directed him. Clearly they were two creations originally  independent of each other, settling down into a working partnership  for purposes merely of mutual accommodation; the spirit evidently  indifferent as to the particular body into which he crept, anxious only  for a place to work in, easily contented.    Varied were these guests that gathered round old Deleglise's oak.  Cabinet Ministers reported to be in Homburg; Russian Nihilists escaped  from Siberia; Italian revolutionaries; high church dignitaries disguised  in grey suitings; ex-errand boys, who had discovered that with six  strokes of the pen they could set half London laughing at whom they  would; raw laddies with the burr yet clinging to their tongues, but  who we knew would one day have the people dancing to the music of their  words. Neither wealth, nor birth, nor age, nor position counted. Was a  man interesting, amusing; had he ideas and thoughts of his own? Then he  was welcome. Men who had come, men who were coming, met there on equal  footing. Among them, as years ago among my schoolmates, I found my  place--somewhat to my dissatisfaction. I amused. Much rather would I  have shocked them by the originality of my views, impressed them with  the depth of my judgments. They declined to be startled, refused to  be impressed; instead, they laughed. Nor from these men could I obtain  sympathy in my disappointment.    “What do you mean, you villain!” roared Deleglise's caretaker at me one  evening on entering the kitchen. “How dare you waste your time writing  this sort of stuff?”    He had a copy of the paper containing my “Witch of Moel Sarbod” in his  hand--then some months old. He screwed it up into a ball and flung it in  my face. “I've only just read it. What did you get for it?”    “Nothing,” I answered.    “Nothing!” he screamed. “You got off for nothing? You ought to have been  whipped at the cart's tail!”    “Oh, come, it's not as bad as that,” suggested old Deleglise.    “Not bad! There isn't a laugh in it from beginning to end.”    “There wasn't intended to be,” I interrupted.    “Why not, you swindler? What were you sent into the world to do? To make  it laugh.”    “I want to make it think,” I told him.    “Make it think! Hasn't it got enough to think about? Aren't there ten  thousand penny-a-liners, poets, tragedians, tub-thumpers, long-eared  philosophers, boring it to death? Who are you to turn up your nose at  your work and tell the Almighty His own business? You are here to make  us laugh. Get on with your work, you confounded young idiot!”    Urban Vane was the only one among them who understood me, who agreed  with me that I was fitted for higher things than merely to minister  to the world's need of laughter. He alone it was who would listen  with approval to my dreams of becoming a famous tragedian, a writer of  soul-searching books, of passion-analysing plays. I never saw him laugh  himself, certainly not at anything funny. “Humour!” he would explain  in his languid drawl, “personally it doesn't amuse me.” One felt its  introduction into the scheme of life had been an error. He was a large,  fleshy man, with a dreamy, caressing voice and strangely impassive face.  Where he came from, who he was, nobody knew. Without ever passing a  remark himself that was worth listening to, he, nevertheless, by some  mysterious trick of manner I am unable to explain, soon established  himself, even throughout that company, where as a rule men found their  proper level, as a silent authority in all contests of wit or argument.  Stories at which he listened, bored, fell flat. The _bon mot_ at which  some faint suggestion of a smile quivered round his clean-shaven lips  was felt to be the crown of the discussion. I can only conclude his  secret to have been his magnificent assumption of superiority, added to  a sphinx-like impenetrability behind which he could always retire from  any danger of exposure. Subjects about which he knew nothing--and I  have come to the conclusion they were more numerous than was  suspected--became in his presence topics outside the radius of  cultivated consideration: one felt ashamed of having introduced them.  His own subjects--they were few but exclusive--he had the knack of  elevating into intellectual tests: one felt ashamed, reflecting how  little one knew about them. Whether he really did possess a charm of  manner, or whether the sense of his superiority with which he had imbued  me it was that made any condescension he paid me a thing to grasp at, I  am unable to say. Certain it is that when he suggested I should throw  up chorus singing and accompany him into the provinces as manager of a  theatrical company he was then engaging to run a wonderful drama that  was going to revolutionise the English stage and educate the English  public, I allowed myself not a moment for consideration, but accepted  his proposal with grateful delight.    “Who is he?” asked Dan. Somehow he had never impressed Dan; but then Dan  was a fellow to impress whom was slow work. As he himself confessed, he  had no instinct for character. “I judge,” he would explain, “purely by  observation.”    “What does that matter?” was my reply.    “What does he know about the business?”    “That's why he wants me.”    “What do you know about it?”    “There's not much to know. I can find out.”    “Take care you don't find out that there's more to know than you think.  What is this wonderful play of his?”    “I haven't seen it yet; I don't think it's finished. It's something from  the Spanish or the Russian, I'm not sure. I'm to put it into shape  when he's done the translation. He wants me to put my name to it as the  adaptor.”    “Wonder he hasn't asked you to wear his clothes. Has he got any money?”    “Of course he has money. How can you run a theatrical company without  money?”    “Have you seen the money?”    “He doesn't carry it about with him in a bag.”    “I should have thought your ambition to be to act, not to manage.  Managers are to be had cheap enough. Why should he want some one who  knows nothing about it?”    “I'm going to act. I'm going to play a leading part.”    “Great Scott!”    “He'll do the management really himself; I shall simply advise him. But  he doesn't want his own name to appear.    “Why not?”    “His people might object.”    “Who are his people?”    “How do I know? What a suspicious chap you are.”    Dan shrugged his shoulders. “You are not an actor, you never will be;  you are not a business man. You've made a start at writing, that's your  proper work. Why not go on with it?”    “I can't get on with it. That one thing was accepted, and never paid  for; everything else comes back regularly, just as before. Besides, I  can go on writing wherever I am.”    “You've got friends here to help you.”    “They don't believe I can do anything but write nonsense.”    “Well, clever nonsense is worth writing. It's better than stodgy sense:  literature is blocked up with that. Why not follow their advice?”    “Because I don't believe they are right. I'm not a clown; I don't mean  to be. Because a man has a sense of humour it doesn't follow he has  nothing else. That is only one of my gifts, and by no means the highest.  I have knowledge of human nature, poetry, dramatic instinct. I mean to  prove it to you all. Vane's the only man that understands me.”    Dan lit his pipe. “Have you made up your mind to go?”    “Of course I have. It's an opportunity that doesn't occur twice.  'There's a tide in the affairs--”    “Thanks,” interrupted Dan; “I've heard it before. Well, if you've made  up your mind, there's an end of the matter. Good luck to you! You are  young, and it's easier to learn things then than later.”    “You talk,” I answered, “as if you were old enough to be my  grandfather.”    He smiled and laid both hands upon my shoulders. “So I am,” he said,  “quite old enough, little boy Paul. Don't be angry; you'll always be  little Paul to me.” He put his hands in his pockets and strolled to the  window.    “What'll you do?” I enquired. “Will you keep on these rooms?”    “No,” he replied. “I shall accept an offer that has been made to me to  take the sub-editorship of a big Yorkshire paper. It is an important  position and will give me experience.”    “You'll never be happy mewed up in a provincial town,” I told him. “I  shall want a London address, and I can easily afford it. Let's keep them  on together.”    He shook his head. “It wouldn't be the same thing,” he said.    So there came a morning when we said good-bye. Before Dan returned from  the office I should be gone. They had been pleasant months that we had  spent together in these pretty rooms. Though my life was calling to  me full of hope, I felt the pain of leaving them. Two years is a long  period in a young man's life, when the sap is running swiftly. My  affections had already taken root there. The green leaves in summer, in  winter the bare branches of the square, the sparrows that chirped about  the window-sills, the quiet peace of the great house, Dan, kindly old  Deleglise: around them my fibres clung, closer than I had known. The  Lady of the train: she managed it now less clumsily. Her hands and  feet had grown smaller, her elbows rounder. I found myself smiling as  I thought of her--one always did smile when one thought of Norah,  everybody did;--of her tomboy ways, her ringing laugh--there were those  who termed it noisy; her irrepressible frankness--there were times when  it was inconvenient. Would she ever become lady-like, sedate, proper?  One doubted it. I tried to picture her a wife, the mistress of a house.  I found the smile deepening round my mouth. What a jolly wife she would  make! I could see her bustling, full of importance; flying into tempers,  lasting possibly for thirty seconds; then calling herself names, saving  all argument by undertaking her own scolding, and doing it well. I  followed her to motherhood. What a joke it would be! What would she do  with them? She would just let them do what they liked with her. She and  they would be a parcel of children together, she the most excited of  them all. No; on second thoughts I could detect in her a strong vein of  common sense. They would have to mind their p's and q's. I could see her  romping with them, helping them to tear their clothes; but likewise I  could see her flying after them, bringing back an armful struggling,  bathing it, physicking it. Perhaps she would grow stout, grow grey; but  she would still laugh more often than sigh, speak her mind, be quick,  good-tempered Norah to the end. Her character precluded all hope of  surprise. That, as I told myself, was its defect. About her were none of  those glorious possibilities that make of some girls charming mysteries.  A woman, said I to myself, should be a wondrous jewel, hiding unknown  lights and shadows. You, my dear Norah--I spoke my thoughts aloud, as  had become a habit with me: those who live much alone fall into this  way--you are merely a crystal, not shallow--no, I should not call you  shallow by any mans, but transparent.    What would he be, her lover? Some plain, matter-of-fact, business-like  young fellow, a good player of cricket and football, fond of his dinner.  What a very uninteresting affair the love-making would be! If she liked  him--well, she would probably tell him so; if she didn't, he would know  it in five minutes.    As for inducing her to change ",53.55,11.0,12.3,8.36,13.2,6.01,3186,14.75,13.16,12th and 13th grade
23,Salomer,"maître de tout, m’aime beaucoup.  Il vient de m’envoyer  des cadeaux de grande valeur.  Aussi il m’a promis de citer à Rome le roi  de Cappadoce qui est mon ennemi.  Peut-être à Rome il le crucifiera.  Il  peut faire tout ce qu’il veut, César.  Enfin, il est le maître.  Ainsi,  vous voyez, j’ai le droit d’être heureux.  Il n’y a rien au monde qui  puisse gâter mon plaisir.    LA VOIX D’IOKANAAN.  Il sera assis sur son trône.  Il sera vêtu de  pourpre et d’écarlate.  Dans sa main il portera un vase d’or plein de ses  blasphèmes.  Et l’ange du Seigneur Dieu le frappera.  Il sera mangé des  vers.    HÉRODIAS.  Vous entendez ce qu’il dit de vous.  Il dit que vous serez  mangé des vers.    HÉRODE.  Ce n’est pas de moi qu’il parle.  Il ne dit jamais rien contre  moi.  C’est du roi de Cappadoce qu’il parle, du roi de Cappadoce qui est  mon ennemi.  C’est celui-là qui sera mangé des vers.  Ce n’est pas moi.  Jamais il n’a rien dit contre moi, le prophète, sauf que j’ai eu tort de  prendre comme épouse l’épouse de mon frère.  Peut-être a-t-il raison.  En  effet, vous êtes stérile.    HÉRODIAS.  Je suis stérile, moi.  Et vous dites cela, vous qui regardez  toujours ma fille, vous qui avez voulu la faire danser pour votre  plaisir.  C’est ridicule de dire cela.  Moi j’ai eu un enfant.  Vous  n’avez jamais eu d’enfant, même d’une de vos esclaves.  C’est vous qui  êtes stérile, ce n’est pas moi.    HÉRODE.  Taisez-vous.  Je vous dis que vous êtes stérile.  Vous ne m’avez  pas donné d’enfant, et le prophète dit que notre mariage n’est pas un  vrai mariage.  Il dit que c’est un mariage incestueux, un mariage qui  apportera des malheurs . . . J’ai peur qu’il n’ait raison.  Je suis sûr  qu’il a raison.  Mais ce n’est pas le moment de parler de ces choses.  En  ce moment-ci je veux être heureux.  Au fait je le suis.  Je suis très  heureux.  Il n’y a rien qui me manque.    HÉRODIAS.  Je suis bien contente que vous soyez de si belle humeur, ce  soir.  Ce n’est pas dans vos habitudes.  Mais il est tard.  Rentrons.  Vous n’oubliez pas qu’au lever du soleil nous allons tous à la chasse.  Aux ambassadeurs de César il faut faire tout honneur, n’est-ce pas?    LE SECOND SOLDAT.  Comme il a l’air sombre, le tétrarque.    LE PREMIER SOLDAT.  Oui, il a l’air sombre.    HÉRODE.  Salomé, Salomé, dansez pour moi.  Je vous supplie de danser pour  moi.  Ce soir je suis triste.  Oui, je suis très triste ce soir.  Quand  je suis entré ici, j’ai glissé dans le sang, ce qui est d’un mauvais  présage, et j’ai entendu, je suis sûr que j’ai entendu un battement  d’ailes dans l’air, un battement d’ailes gigantesques.  Je ne sais pas ce  que cela veut dire . . . Je suis triste ce soir.  Ainsi dansez pour moi.  Dansez pour moi, Salomé, je vous supplie.  Si vous dansez pour moi vous  pourrez me demander tout ce que vous voudrez et je vous le donnerai.  Oui, dansez pour moi, Salomé, et je vous donnerai tout ce que vous me  demanderez, fût-ce la moitié de mon royaume.    SALOMÉ [_se levant_] Vous me donnerez tout ce que je demanderai,  tétrarque?    HÉRODIAS.  Ne dansez pas, ma fille.    HÉRODE.  Tout, fût-ce la moitié de mon royaume.    SALOMÉ.  Vous le jurez, tétrarque?    HÉRODE.  Je le jure, Salomé.    HÉRODIAS.  Ma fille, ne dansez pas.    SALOMÉ.  Sur quoi jurez-vous, tétrarque?    HÉRODE.  Sur ma vie, sur ma couronne, sur mes dieux.  Tout ce que vous  voudrez je vous le donnerai, fût-ce la moitié de mon royaume, si vous  dansez pour moi.  Oh! Salomé, Salomé, dansez pour moi.    SALOMÉ.  Vous avez juré, tétrarque.    HÉRODE.  J’ai juré, Salomé.    SALOMÉ.  Tout ce que je vous demanderai, fût-ce la moitié de votre  royaume?    HÉRODIAS.  Ne dansez pas, ma fille.    HÉRODE.  Fût-ce la moitié de mon royaume.  Comme reine, tu serais très  belle, Salomé, s’il te plaisait de demander la moitié de mon royaume.  N’est-ce pas qu’elle serait très belle comme reine? . . . Ah! il fait  froid ici! il y a un vent très froid, et j’entends . . . pourquoi est-ce  que j’entends dans l’air ce battement d’ailes?  Oh! on dirait qu’il y a  un oiseau, un grand oiseau noir, qui plane sur la terrasse.  Pourquoi  est-ce que je ne peux pas le voir, cet oiseau?  Le battement de ses ailes  est terrible.  Le vent qui vient de ses ailes est terrible.  C’est un  vent froid . . . Mais non, il ne fait pas froid du tout.  Au contraire,  il fait très chaud.  Il fait trop chaud.  J’étouffe.  Versez-moi l’eau  sur les mains.  Donnez-moi de la neige à manger.  Dégrafez mon manteau.  Vite, vite, dégrafez mon manteau . . . Non.  Laissez-le.  C’est ma  couronne qui me fait mal, ma couronne de roses.  On dirait que ces fleurs  sont faites de feu.  Elles ont brûlé mon front.  [_Il arrache de sa tête  la couronne_, _et la jette sur la table_.]  Ah! enfin, je respire.  Comme  ils sont rouges ces pétales!  On dirait des taches de sang sur la nappe.  Cela ne fait rien.  Il ne faut pas trouver des symboles dans chaque chose  qu’on voit.  Cela rend la vie impossible.  Il serait mieux de dire que  les taches de sang sont aussi belles que les pétales de roses.  Il serait  beaucoup mieux de dire cela . . . Mais ne parlons pas de cela.  Maintenant je suis heureux.  Je suis très heureux.  J’ai le droit d’être  heureux, n’est-ce pas?  Votre fille va danser pour moi.  N’est-ce pas que  vous allez danser pour moi, Salomé?  Vous avez promis de danser pour moi.    HÉRODIAS.  Je ne veux pas qu’elle danse.    SALOMÉ.  Je danserai pour vous, tétrarque.    HÉRODE.  Vous entendez ce que dit votre fille.  Elle va danser pour moi.  Vous avez bien raison, Salomé, de danser pour moi.  Et, après que vous  aurez dansé n’oubliez pas de me demander tout ce que vous voudrez.  Tout  ce que vous voudrez je vous le donnerai, fût-ce la moitié de mon royaume.  J’ai juré, n’est-ce pas?    SALOMÉ.  Vous avez juré, tétrarque.    HÉRODE.  Et je n’ai jamais manqué à ma parole.  Je ne suis pas de ceux  qui manquent à leur parole.  Je ne sais pas mentir.  Je suis l’esclave de  ma parole, et ma parole c’est la parole d’un roi.  Le roi de Cappadoce  ment toujours, mais ce n’est pas un vrai roi.  C’est un lâche.  Aussi il  me doit de l’argent qu’il ne veut pas payer.  Il a même insulté mes  ambassadeurs.  Il a dit des choses très blessantes.  Mais César le  crucifiera quand il viendra à Rome.  Je suis sûr que César le crucifiera.  Sinon il mourra mangé des vers.  Le prophète l’a prédit.  Eh bien!  Salomé, qu’attendez-vous?    SALOMÉ.  J’attends que mes esclaves m’apportent des parfums et les sept  voiles et m’ôtent mes sandales.    [_Les esclaves apportent des parfums et les sept voiles et ôtent les  sandales de Salomé_.]    HÉRODE.  Ah! vous allez danser pieds nus!  C’est bien!  C’est bien!  Vos  petits pieds seront comme des colombes blanches.  Ils ressembleront à des  petites fleurs blanches qui dansent sur un arbre . . . Ah! non.  Elle va  danser dans le sang!  Il y a du sang par terre.  Je ne veux pas qu’elle  danse dans le sang.  Ce serait d’un très mauvais présage.    HÉRODIAS.  Qu’est-ce que cela vous fait qu’elle danse dans le sang?  Vous  avez bien marché dedans, vous . . .    HÉRODE.  Qu’est-ce que cela me fait?  Ah! regardez la lune!  Elle est  devenue rouge.  Elle est devenue rouge comme du sang.  Ah! le prophète  l’a bien prédit.  Il a prédit que la lune deviendrait rouge comme du  sang.  N’est-ce pas qu’il a prédit cela?  Vous l’avez tous entendu.  La  lune est devenue rouge comme du sang.  Ne le voyez-vous pas?    HÉRODIAS.  Je le vois bien, et les étoiles tombent comme des figues  vertes, n’est-ce pas?  Et le soleil devient noir comme un sac de poil, et  les rois de la terre ont peur.  Cela au moins on le voit.  Pour une fois  dans sa vie le prophète a eu raison.  Les rois de la terre ont peur . . .  Enfin, rentrons.  Vous êtes malade.  On va dire à Rome que vous êtes fou.  Rentrons, je vous dis.    LA VOIX D’IOKANAAN.  Qui est celui qui vient d’Edom, qui vient de Bosra  avec sa robe teinte de pourpre; qui éclate dans la beauté de ses  vêtements, et qui marche avec une force toute puissante?  Pourquoi vos  vêtements sont-ils teints d’écarlate?    HÉRODIAS.  Rentrons.  La voix de cet homme m’exaspère.  Je ne veux pas  que ma fille danse pendant qu’il crie comme cela.  Je ne veux pas qu’elle  danse pendant que vous la regardez comme cela.  Enfin, je ne veux pas  qu’elle danse.    HÉRODE.  Ne te lève pas, mon épouse, ma reine, c’est inutile.  Je ne  rentrerai pas avant qu’elle n’ait dansé.  Dansez, Salomé, dansez pour  moi.    HÉRODIAS.  Ne dansez pas, ma fille.    SALOMÉ.  Je suis prête, tétrarque.    [_Salomé danse la danse des sept voiles_.]    HÉRODE.  Ah! c’est magnifique, c’est magnifique!  Vous voyez qu’elle a  dansé pour moi, votre fille.  Approchez, Salomé!  Approchez, afin que je  puisse vous donner votre salaire.  Ah! je paie bien les danseuses, moi.  Toi, je te paierai bien.  Je te donnerai tout ce que tu voudras.  Que  veux-tu, dis?    SALOMÉ [_s’agenouillant_] Je veux qu’on m’apporte présentement dans un  bassin d’argent . . .    HÉRODE [_riant_] Dans un bassin d’argent? mais oui, dans un bassin  d’argent, certainement.  Elle est charmante, n’est-ce pas?  Qu’est-ce que  vous voulez qu’on vous apporte dans un bassin d’argent, ma chère et belle  Salomé, vous qui êtes la plus belle de toutes les filles de Judée?  Qu’est-ce que vous voulez qu’on vous apporte dans un bassin d’argent?  Dites-moi.  Quoi que cela puisse être on vous le donnera.  Mes trésors  vous appartiennent.  Qu’est-ce que c’est, Salomé.    SALOMÉ [_se levant_] La tête d’Iokanaan.    HÉRODIAS.  Ah! c’est bien dit, ma fille.    HÉRODE.  Non, non.    HÉRODIAS.  C’est bien dit, ma fille.    HÉRODE.  Non, non, Salomé.  Vous ne me demandez pas cela.  N’écoutez pas  votre mère.  Elle vous donne toujours de mauvais conseils.  Il ne faut  pas l’écouter.    SALOMÉ.  Je n’écoute pas ma mère.  C’est pour mon propre plaisir que je  demande la tête d’Iokanaan dans un bassin d’argent.  Vous avez juré,  Hérode.  N’oubliez pas que vous avez juré.    HÉRODE.  Je le sais.  J’ai juré par mes dieux.  Je le sais bien.  Mais je  vous supplie, Salomé, de me demander autre chose.  Demandez-moi la moitié  de mon royaume, et je vous la donnerai.  Mais ne me demandez pas ce que  vous m’avez demandé.    SALOMÉ.  Je vous demande la tête d’Iokanaan.    HÉRODE.  Non, non, je ne veux pas.    SALOMÉ.  Vous avez juré, Hérode.    HÉRODIAS.  Oui, vous avez juré.  Tout le monde vous a entendu.  Vous avez  juré devant tout le monde.    HÉRODIAS.  Taisez-vous.  Ce n’est pas à vous que je parle.    HÉRODIAS.  Ma fille a bien raison de demander la tête de cet homme.  Il a  vomi des insultes contre moi.  Il a dit des choses monstrueuses contre  moi.  On voit qu’elle aime beaucoup sa mére.  Ne cédez pas, ma fille.  Il  a juré, il a juré.    HÉRODE.  Taisez-vous.  Ne me parlez pas . . . Voyons, Salomé, il faut  être raisonnable, n’est-ce pas?  N’est-ce pas qu’il faut être  raisonnable?  Je n’ai jamais été dur envers vous.  Je vous ai toujours  aimée . . . Peut-être, je vous ai trop aimée.  Ainsi, ne me demandez pas  cela.  C’est horrible, c’est épouvantable de me demander cela.  Au fond,  je ne crois pas que vous soyez sérieuse.  La tête d’un homme décapitée,  c’est une chose laide, n’est-ce pas?  Ce n’est pas une chose qu’une  vierge doive regarder.  Quel plaisir cela pourrait-il vous donner?  Aucun.  Non, non, vous ne voulez pas cela . . . Écoutez-moi un instant.  J’ai une émeraude, une grande émeraude ronde que le favori de César m’a  envoyée.  Si vous regardiez à travers cette émeraude vous pourriez voir  des choses qui se passent à une distance immense.  César lui-même en  porte une tout à fait pareille quand il va au cirque.  Mais la mienne est  plus grande.  Je sais bien qu’elle est plus grande.  C’est la plus grande  émeraude du monde.  N’est-ce pas que vous voulez cela?  Demandez-moi cela  et je vous le donnerai.    SALOMÉ.  Je demande la tête d’Iokanaan.    HÉRODE.  Vous ne m’écoutez pas, vous ne m’écoutez pas.  Enfin,  laissez-moi parler, Salomé.    SALOMÉ.  La tête d’Iokanaan.    HÉRODE.  Non, non, vous ne voulez pas cela.  Vous me dites cela seulement  pour me faire de la peine, parce que je vous ai regardée pendant toute la  soirée.  Eh! bien, oui.  Je vous ai regardée pendant toute la soirée.  Votre beauté m’a troublé.  Votre beauté m’a terriblement troublé, et je  vous ai trop regardée.  Mais je ne le ferai plus.  Il ne faut regarder ni  les choses ni les personnes.  Il ne faut regarder que dans les miroirs.  Car les miroirs ne nous montrent que des masques . . . Oh!  Oh! du vin!  j’ai soif . . . Salomé, Salomé, soyons amis.  Enfin, voyez . . .  Qu’est-ce que je voulais dire?  Qu’est-ce que c’était?  Ah! je m’en  souviens! . . . Salomé!  Non, venez plus près de moi.  J’ai peur que vous  ne m’entendiez pas . . . Salomé, vous connaissez mes paons blancs, mes  beaux paons blancs, qui se promènent dans le jardin entre les myrtes et  les grands cyprès.  Leurs becs sont dorés, et les grains qu’ils mangent  sont dorés aussi, et leurs pieds sont teints de pourpre.  La pluie vient  quand ils crient, et quand ils se pavanent la lune se montre au ciel.  Ils vont deux à deux entre les cyprès et les myrtes noirs et chacun a son  esclave pour le soigner.  Quelquefois ils volent à travers les arbres, et  quelquefois ils couchent sur le gazon et autour de l’étang.  Il n’y a pas  dans le monde d’oiseaux si merveilleux.  Il n’y a aucun roi du monde qui  possède des oiseaux aussi merveilleux.  Je suis sûr que même César ne  possède pas d’oiseaux aussi beaux.  Eh bien! je vous donnerai cinquante  de mes paons.  Ils vous suivront partout, et au milieu d’eux vous serez  comme la lune dans un grand nuage blanc . . . Je vous les donnerai tous.  Je n’en ai que cent, et il n’y a aucun roi du monde qui possède des paons  comme les miens, mais je vous les donnerai tous.  Seulement, il faut me  délier de ma parole et ne pas me demander ce que vous m’avez demandé.  [_Il vide la coupe de vin_.]    SALOMÉ.  Donnez-moi la tête d’Iokanaan.    HÉRODIAS.  C’est bien dit, ma fille!  Vous, vous êtes ridicule avec vos  paons.    HÉRODE.  Taisez-vous.  Vous criez toujours.  Vous criez comme une bête de  proie.  Il ne faut pas crier comme cela.  Votre voix m’ennuie.  Taisez-vous, je vous dis . . . Salomé, pensez à ce que vous faites.  Cet  homme vient peut-être de Dieu.  Je suis sûr qu’il vient de Dieu.  C’est  un saint homme.  Le doigt de Dieu l’a touché.  Dieu a mis dans sa bouche  des mots terribles.  Dans le palais, comme dans le désert, Dieu est  toujours avec lui . . . Au moins, c’est possible.  On ne sait pas, mais  il est possible que Dieu soit pour lui et avec lui.  Aussi peut-être que  s’il mourrait, il m’arriverait un malheur.  Enfin, il a dit que le jour  où il mourrait il arriverait un malheur à quelqu’un.  Ce ne peut être  qu’à moi.  Souvenez-vous, j’ai glissé dans le sang quand je suis entré  ici.  Aussi j’ai entendu un battement d’ailes dans l’air, un battement  d’ailes gigantesques.  Ce sont de très mauvais présages.  Et il y en  avait d’autres.  Je suis sûr qu’il y en avait d’autres, quoique je ne les  aie pas vus.  Eh bien!  Salomé, vous ne voulez pas qu’un malheur  m’arrive?  Vous ne voulez pas cela.  Enfin, écoutez-moi.    SALOMÉ.  Donnez-moi la tête d’Iokanaan.    HÉRODE.  Vous voyez, vous ne m’écoutez pas.  Mais soyez calme.  Moi, je  suis très calme.  Je suis tout à fait calme.  Écoutez.  J’ai des bijoux  cachés ici que même votre mère n’a jamais vus, des bijoux tout à fait  extraordinaires.  J’ai un collier de perles à quatre rangs.  On dirait  des lunes enchaînées de rayons d’argent.  On dirait cinquante lunes  captives dans un filet d’or.  Une reine l’a porté sur l’ivoire de ses  seins.  Toi, quand tu le porteras, tu seras aussi belle qu’une reine.  J’ai des améthystes de deux espèces.  Une qui est noire comme le vin.  L’autre qui est rouge comme du vin qu’on a coloré avec de l’eau.  J’ai  des topazes jaunes comme les yeux des tigres, et des topazes roses comme  les yeux des pigeons, et des topazes vertes comme les yeux des chats.  J’ai des opales qui brûlent toujours avec une flamme qui est très froide,  des opales qui attristent les esprits et ont peur des ténèbres.  J’ai des  onyx semblables aux prunelles d’une morte.  J’ai des sélénites qui  changent quand la lune change et deviennent pâles quand elles voient le  soleil.  J’ai des saphirs grands comme des œufs et bleus comme des fleurs  bleues.  La mer erre dedans, et la lune ne vient jamais troubler le bleu  de ses flots.  J’ai des chrysolithes et des béryls, j’ai des chrysoprases  et des rubis, j’ai des sardonyx et des hyacinthes, et des calcédoines et  je vous les donnerai tous, mais tous, et j’ajouterai d’autres choses.  Le  roi des Indes vient justement de m’envoyer quatre éventails faits de  plumes de perroquets, et le roi de Numidie une robe faite de plumes  d’autruche.  J’ai un cristal qu’il n’est pas permis aux femmes de voir et  que même les jeunes hommes ne doivent regarder qu’après avoir été  flagellés de verges.  Dans un coffret de nacre j’ai trois turquoises  merveilleuses.  Quand on les porte sur le front on peut imaginer des  choses qui n’existent pas, et quand on les porte dans la main on peut  rendre les femmes stériles.  Ce sont des trésors de grande valeur.  Ce  sont des trésors sans prix.  Et ce n’est pas tout.  Dans un coffret  d’ébène j’ai deux coupes d’ambre qui ressemblent à des pommes d’or.  Si  un ennemi verse du poison dans ces coupes elles deviennent comme des  pommes d’argent.  Dans un coffret incrusté d’ambre j’ai des sandales  incrustées de verre.  J’ai des manteaux qui viennent du pays des Sères et  des bracelets garnis d’escarboucles et de jade qui viennent de la ville  d’Euphrate. . . Enfin, que veux-tu, Salomé?  Dis-moi ce que tu désires et  je te le donnerai.  Je te donnerai tout ce que tu demanderas, sauf une  chose.  Je te donnerai tout ce que je possède, sauf une vie.  Je te  donnerai le manteau du grand prêtre.  Je te donnerai le voile du  sanctuaire.    LES JUIFS.  Oh! Oh!    SALOMÉ.  Donne-moi la tête d’Iokanaan.    HÉRODE [_s’affaissant sur son siège_]  Qu’on lui donne ce qu’elle  demande!  C’est bien la fille de sa mère!  [_Le premier soldat  s’approche_.  _Hérodias prend de la main du tétrarque la bague de la mort  et la donne au soldat qui l’apporte immédiatement au bourreau_.  _Le  bourreau a l’air effaré_.]  Qui a pris ma bague?  Il y avait une bague à  ma main droite.  Qui a bu mon vin!  Il y avait du vin dans ma coupe.  Elle était pleine de vin.  Quelqu’un l’a bu?  Oh! je suis sûr qu’il va  arriver un malheur à quelqu’un.  [_Le bourreau descend dans la citerne_.]  Ah! pourquoi ai-je donné ma parole?  Les rois ne doivent jamais donner  leur parole.  S’ils ne la gardent pas, c’est terrible.  S’ils la gardent,  c’est terrible aussi . . .    HÉRODIAS.  Je trouve que ma fille a bien fait.    HÉRODE.  Je suis sûr qu’il va arriver un malheur.    SALOMÉ [_Elle se penche sur la citerne et écoute_.]  Il n’y a pas de  bruit.  Je n’entends rien.  Pourquoi ne crie-t-il pas, cet homme?  Ah! si  quelqu’un cherchait à me tuer, je crierais, je me débattrais, je ne  voudrais pas souffrir . . . Frappe, frappe, Naaman.  Frappe, je te dis . . .  Non.  Je n’entends rien.  Il y a un silence affreux.  Ah! quelque  chose est tombé par terre.  J’ai entendu quelque chose tomber.  C’était  l’épée du bourreau.  Il a peur, cet esclave!  Il a laissé tomber son  épée.  Il n’ose pas le tuer.  C’est un lâche, cet esclave!  Il faut  envoyer des soldats.  [_Elle voit le page d’Hérodias et s’adresse à  lui_.]  Viens ici.  Tu as été l’ami de celui qui est mort, n’est-ce pas?  Eh bien, il n’y a pas eu assez de morts.  Dites aux soldats qu’ils  descendent et m’apportent ce que je demande, ce que le tétrarque m’a  promis, ce qui m’appartient.  [_Le page recule_.  _Elle s’adresse aux  soldats_.]  Venez ici, soldats.  Descendez dans cette citerne, et  apportez-moi la tête de cet homme.  [_Les soldats reculent_.]  Tétrarque,  tétrarque, commandez à vos soldats de m’apporter la tête d’Iokanaan.  [_Un grand bras noir_, _le bras du bourreau_, _sort de la citerne  apportant sur un bouclier d’argent la tête d’Iokanaan_.  _Salomé la  saisit_.  _Hérode se cache le visage_, _avec son manteau_.  _Hérodias  sourit et s’évente_.  _Les Nazaréens s’agenouillent et commencent à  prier_.]  Ah! tu n’as pas voulu me laisser baiser ta bouche, Iokanaan.  Eh bien! je la baiserai maintenant.  Je la mordrai avec mes dents comme  on mord un fruit mûr.  Oui, je baiserai ta bouche, Iokanaan.  Je te l’ai  dit, n’est-ce pas? je te l’ai dit.  Eh bien! je la baiserai maintenant . . .  Mais pourquoi ne me regardes-tu pas, Iokanaan?  Tes yeux qui étaient  si terribles, qui étaient si pleins de colère et de mépris, ils sont  fermés maintenant.  Pourquoi sont-ils fermés?  Ouvre tes yeux!  Soulève  tes paupières, Iokanaan.  Pourquoi ne me regardes-tu pas?  As-tu peur de  moi, Iokanaan, que tu ne veux pas me regarder? . . . Et ta langue qui  était comme un serpent rouge dardant des poisons, elle ne remue plus,  elle ne dit rien maintenant, Iokanaan, cette vipère rouge qui a vomi son  venin sur moi.  C’est étrange, n’est-ce pas?  Comment se fait-il que la  vipère rouge ne remue plus? . . . Tu n’as pas voulu de moi, Iokanaan.  Tu  m’as rejetée.  Tu m’as dit des choses infâmes.  Tu m’as traitée comme une  courtisane, comme une prostituée, moi, Salomé, fille d’Hérodias,  Princesse de Judée!  Eh bien, Iokanaan, moi je vis encore, mais toi tu es  mort et ta tête m’appartient.  Je puis en faire ce que je veux.  Je puis  la jeter aux chiens et aux oiseaux de l’air.  Ce que laisseront les  chiens, les oiseaux de l’air le mangeront . . . Ah! Iokanaan, Iokanaan,  tu as été le seul homme que j’ai aimé.  Tous les autres hommes  m’inspirent du dégoût.  Mais, toi, tu étais beau.  Ton corps était une  colonne d’ivoire sur un socle d’argent.  C’était un jardin plein de  colombes et de lis d’argent.  C’était une tour d’argent ornée de  boucliers d’ivoire.  Il n’y avait rien au monde d’aussi blanc que ton  corps.  Il n’y avait rien au monde d’aussi noir que tes cheveux.  Dans le  monde tout entier il n’y avait rien d’aussi rouge que ta bouche.  Ta voix  était un encensoir qui répandait d’étranges parfums, et quand je te  regardais j’entendais une musique étrange!  Ah! pourquoi ne m’as-tu pas  regardée, Iokanaan?  Derrière tes mains et tes blasphèmes tu as caché ton  visage.  Tu as mis sur tes yeux le bandeau de celui qui veut voir son  Dieu.  Eh bien, tu l’as vu, ton Dieu, Iokanaan, mais moi, moi . . . tu ne  m’as jamais vue.  Si tu m’avais vue, tu m’aurais aimée.  Moi, je t’ai vu,  Iokanaan, et je t’ai aimé.  Oh! comme je t’ai aimé.  Je t’aime encore,  Iokanaan.  Je n’aime que toi . . . J’ai soif de ta beauté.  J’ai faim de  ton corps.  Et ni le vin, ni les fruits ne peuvent apaiser mon désir.  Que ferai-je, Iokanaan, maintenant?  Ni les fleuves ni les grandes eaux,  ne pourraient éteindre ma passion.  J’étais une Princesse, tu m’as  dédaignée.  J’étais une vierge, tu m’as déflorée.  J’étais chaste, tu as  rempli mes veines de feu . . . Ah!  Ah! pourquoi ne m’as-tu pas regardée,  Iokanaan?  Si tu m’avais regardée tu m’aurais aimée.  Je sais bien que tu  m’aurais aimée, et le mystère de l’amour est plus grand que le mystére de  la mort.  Il ne faut regarder que l’amour.    HÉRODE.  Elle est monstrueuse, ta fille, elle est tout à fait  monstrueuse.  Enfin, ce qu’elle a fait est un grand crime.  Je suis sûr  que c’est un crime contre un Dieu inconnu.    HÉRODIAS.  J’approuve ce que ma fille a fait, et je veux rester ici  maintenant.    HÉRODE [_se levant_] Ah! l’épouse incestueuse qui parle!  Viens!  Je ne  veux pas rester ici.  Viens, je te dis.  Je suis sûr qu’il va arriver un  malheur.  Manasse, Issachar, Ozias, éteignez les flambeaux.  Je ne veux  pas regarder les choses.  Je ne veux pas que les choses me regardent.  Éteignez les flambeaux.  Cachez la lune!  Cachez les étoiles!  Cachons-nous dans notre palais, Hérodias.  Je commence à avoir peur.    [_Les esclaves éteignent les flambeaux_.  _Les étoiles disparaissent_.  _Un grand nuage noir passe à travers la lune et la cache complètement_.  _La scène devient tout à fait sombre_.  _Le tétrarque commence à monter  l’escalier_.]    LA VOIX DE SALOMÉ.  Ah! j’ai baisé ta bouche, Iokanaan, j’ai baisé ta  bouche.  Il y avait une âcre saveur sur tes lèvres.  Était-ce la saveur  du sang? . . . Mais, peut-être est-ce la saveur de l’amour.  On dit que  l’amour a une âcre saveur . . . Mais, qu’importe?  Qu’importe?  J’ai  baisé ta bouche, Iokanaan, j’ai baisé ta bouche.    [_Un rayon de lune tombe sur Salomé et l’éclaire_.]    HÉRODE [_se retournant et voyant Salomé_] Tuez cette femme!

24,Pride and Prejudicer,"I rather wished, than believed  him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to  his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the  business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance  in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to  receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection  between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him  to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly  lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free  from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.  For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the  incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to  me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured  me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He  had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely  resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in  question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was  well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not  have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame  me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every  repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of  his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me  to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every  appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But  last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.    “I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,  and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold  to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your  secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to  the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.  About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed  for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided  over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by  design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him  and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and  by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,  whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to  her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and  to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her  excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed  the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two  before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the  idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as  a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and  how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented  any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place  immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.  Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which  is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of  revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have  been complete indeed.    “This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have  been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as  false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.  Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he  had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered  at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,  detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in  your inclination.    “You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but  I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to  be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more  particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our  near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of  the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted  with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_  should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by  the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be  the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some  opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the  morning. I will only add, God bless you.    “FITZWILLIAM DARCY”        Chapter 36      If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to  contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of  its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly  she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did  she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;  and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation  to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong  prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what  had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly  left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the  next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of  the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she  instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst  objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing  him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied  her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and  insolence.    But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when  she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,  if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which  bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her  feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.  Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished  to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!  This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had  gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the  last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not  regard it, that she would never look in it again.    In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on  nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter  was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she  again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and  commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.  The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what  he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though  she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own  words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the  will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living  was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was  impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the  other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did  not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the  particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions  to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three  thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down  the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be  impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with  little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read  on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had  believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to  render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a  turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.    The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at  Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could  bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his  entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the  persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,  had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life  nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As  to his real character, had information been in her power, she had  never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had  established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried  to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of  integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of  Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those  casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy  had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But  no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before  her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more  substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and  the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After  pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to  read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss  Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel  Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was  referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam  himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his  near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no  reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to  him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and  at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never  have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his  cousin's corroboration.    She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation  between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_  struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and  wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting  himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions  with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear  of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that  _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball  the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield  family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but  herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;  that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's  character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would  always prevent his exposing the son.    How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and  hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer  the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.  His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had  either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying  his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most  incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter  and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not  but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago  asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as  were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their  acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much  together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything  that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him  of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was  esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a  brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his  sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his  actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of  everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and  that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man  as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.    She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham  could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,  absurd.    “How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself  on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have  often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified  my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this  discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could  not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my  folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect  of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted  prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were  concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”    From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line  which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation  _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely  different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that  credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to  give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her  sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's  opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his  description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were  little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air  and manner not often united with great sensibility.    When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were  mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense  of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly  for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as  having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first  disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind  than on hers.    The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,  but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been  self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered  that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest  relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt  by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she  had ever known before.    After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every  variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,  and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and  so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made  her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish  of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such  reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.    She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each  called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take  leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least  an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her  till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern  in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no  longer an object; she could think only of her letter.        Chapter 37      The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having  been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was  able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very  good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the  melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then  hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return  brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,  importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of  having them all to dine with her.    Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had  she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as  her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her  ladyship's indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how  would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.    Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure  you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one  feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly  attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to  me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The  dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy  seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His  attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”    Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which  were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.    Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of  spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that  she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:    “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that  you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your  company, I am sure.”    “I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied  Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town  next Saturday.”    “Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected  you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There  can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly  spare you for another fortnight.”    “But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”    “Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters  are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay  another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as  far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as  Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room  for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I  should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”    “You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our  original plan.”    Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant  with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea  of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.  You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in  the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly  guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my  niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her  having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of  Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with  propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those  things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I  am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be  discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”    “My uncle is to send a servant for us.”    “Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you  have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?  Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be  attended to.”    Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,  and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,  which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so  occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be  reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it  as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary  walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant  recollections.    Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She  studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at  times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,  she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly  she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against  herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.  His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she  could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,  or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past  behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in  the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.  They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at  them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his  youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right  herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently  united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine  and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,  what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,  irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always  affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would  scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While  there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while  Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there  forever.    Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's  explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,  heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved  to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any  could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How  grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every  respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had  been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!    When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's  character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had  seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it  almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.    Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of  her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent  there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of  their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,  and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right  way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the  work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.    When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them  a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;  and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her  hand to both.        Chapter 38      On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few  minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of  paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.    “I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet  expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very  certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for  it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We  know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain  manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we  see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like  yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,  and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending  your time unpleasantly.”    Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She  had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with  Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_  feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling  solemnity replied:    “It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not  disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately  having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,  from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the  humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford  visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to  Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage  and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You  see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge  that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should  not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are  sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”    Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was  obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility  and truth in a few short sentences.    “You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into  Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will  be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you  have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear  that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be  as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,  that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in  marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of  thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of  character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each  other.”    Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was  the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed  and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to  have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.  Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she  had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that  her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her  home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their  dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.    At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels  placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate  parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by  Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her  with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks  for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his  compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her  in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,  when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had  hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.    “But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects  delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you  while you have been here.”    Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and  the carriage drove off.    “Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, “it seems  but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have  happened!”    “A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.    “We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!  How much I shall have to tell!”    Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”    Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and  within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's  house, where they were to remain a few days.    Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her  spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her  aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at  Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.    It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for  Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know  that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish  Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own  vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation  to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision  in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;  and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried  into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister  further.        Chapter 39      It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out  together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;  and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage  was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's  punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.  These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed  in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and  dressing a salad and cucumber.    After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set  out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,  “Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”    “And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the  money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing  her purchases--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think  it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall  pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any  better.”    And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect  unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and  when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I  think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what  one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they  are going in a fortnight.”    “Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.    “They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to  take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;  and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to  go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall  have!”    “Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,  and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole  campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor  regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”    “Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at  table. “What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about  a certain person we all like!”    Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need  not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:    “Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the  waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse  things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad  he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for  my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?  There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She  is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”    “And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection  imprudent as to fortune.”    “She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”    “But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.    “I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared  three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled  thing?”    Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such  coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_  was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!    As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was  ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their  boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and  Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.    “How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my  bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now  let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way  home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all  since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any  flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband  before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.  She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not  being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to  get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.  Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!  how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would  chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece  of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend  the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the  evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so  she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen  was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We  dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a  lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.  Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow  one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,  and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they  did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.  Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect  something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”    With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did  Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her  companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she  could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.    Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane  in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet  say voluntarily to Elizabeth:    “I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”    Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases  came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that  occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and  poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one  hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat  some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger  Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,  was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who  would hear her.    “Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!  As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there  was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty  had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved  very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold  luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated  you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never  should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then  we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that  anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”    To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,  to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the  generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for  _me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.”    But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to  anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.    In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk  to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily  opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could  not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.  Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The  comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond  expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped  there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.    She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton  scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under  frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her  father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were  at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often  disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.        Chapter 40      Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could  no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every  particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be  surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene  between Mr. Darcy and herself.    Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly  partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly  natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was  sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so  little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the  unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.    “His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly  ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his  disappointment!”    “Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has  other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.  You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”    “Blame you! Oh, no.”    “But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”    “No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”    “But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next  day.”    She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far  as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!  who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that  so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here  collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though  grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.  Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and  seek to clear the one without involving the other.    “This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both  of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied  with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just  enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting  about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;  but you shall do as you choose.”    It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.    “I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so  very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only  consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the  knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing  of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it  so.”    “Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so  full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am  growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion  makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will  be as light as a feather.”    “Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his  countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”    “There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those  two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the  appearance of it.”    “I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you  used to do.”    “And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike  to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an  opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually  abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing  at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”    “Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat  the matter as you do now.”    “Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And  with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say  that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I  had! Oh! how I wanted you!”    “How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions  in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly  undeserved.”    “Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most  natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There  is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I  ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand  Wickham's character.”    Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no  occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”    “That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me  to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular  relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to  myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his  conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy  is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in  Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal  to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to  anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,  and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At  present I will say nothing about it.”    “You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for  ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to  re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”    The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had  got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,  and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish  to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,  of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other  half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she  had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one  could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect  understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off  this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very  improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to  tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The  liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!”    She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real  state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a  very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself  in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,  and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first  attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,  and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her  attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the  indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own  health and their tranquillity.    “Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of  this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak  of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But  I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is  a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least  chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of  his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of  everybody, too, who is likely to know.”    “I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”    “Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I  shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I  would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will  die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.”    But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,  she made no answer.    “Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the  Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope  it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an  excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her  mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_  housekeeping, I dare say.”    “No, nothing at all.”    “A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will  take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed  for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often  talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as  quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”    “It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”    “No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they  often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an  estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be  ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”        Chapter 41      The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was  the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies  in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost  universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,  and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very  frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and  Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such  hard-heartedness in any of the family.    “Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they  often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,  Lizzy?”    Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what  she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years  ago.    “I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel  Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.”    “I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.    “If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.    “Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so  disagreeable.”    “A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”    “And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”   added Kitty.    Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through  Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense  of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's  objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his  interference in the views of his friend.    But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she  received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of  the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a  very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour  and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of  their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.    The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,  the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely  to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia  flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's  congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;  whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate  in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.    “I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”   said she, “Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much  right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”    In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make  her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from  exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she  considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense  for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it  known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her  go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general  behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of  such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more  imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must  be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:    “Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public  place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so  little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present  circumstances.”    “If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to  us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and  imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you  would judge differently in the affair.”    “Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away  some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such  squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity  are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who  have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.”    “Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not  of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our  importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the  wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark  Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear  father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and  of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of  her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character  will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt  that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the  worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond  youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness  of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal  contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger  Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,  ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you  suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever  they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the  disgrace?”    Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and  affectionately taking her hand said in reply:    “Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known  you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less  advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly  sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to  Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will  keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an  object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance  even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find  women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being  there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow  many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest  of her life.”    With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion  continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not  in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on  them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret  over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her  disposition.    Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her  father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their  united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised  every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye  of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.  She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them  at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents  stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young  and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she  saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six  officers at once.    Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such  realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have  been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.  Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy  conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.    But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures  continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving  home.    Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been  frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty  well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even  learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted  her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present  behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,  for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which  had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after  what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in  finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous  gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the  reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever  cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,  and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.    On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,  with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth  disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some  inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she  mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three  weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.    He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's  recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen  him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,  asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.  With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:    “How long did you say he was at Rosings?”    “Nearly three weeks.”    “And you saw him frequently?”    “Yes, almost every day.”    “His manners are very different from his cousin's.”    “Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”    “Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And  pray, may I ask?--” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is  it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility  to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower  and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”    “Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much  what he ever was.”    While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to  rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a  something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive  and anxious attention, while she added:    “When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that  his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from  knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”    Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated  look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his  embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of  accents:    “You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily  comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume  even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,  may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only  deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only  fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been  alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good  opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always  operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be  imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I  am certain he has very much at heart.”    Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a  slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on  the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge  him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his  side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish  Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a  mutual desire of never meeting again.    When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,  from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation  between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the  only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.  Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,  and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the  opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which  there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in  the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more  gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.        Chapter 42      Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could  not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic  comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance  of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a  woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in  their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,  esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views  of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of  a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own  imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often  console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of  the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal  enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as  her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not  the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his  wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true  philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.    Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her  father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but  respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of  herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to  banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation  and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own  children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so  strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so  unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising  from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,  might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even  if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.    When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little  other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties  abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and  sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around  them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty  might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers  of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition  greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all  her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a  watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what  has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been  looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the  satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to  name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have  some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by  again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the  present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes  was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation  for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother  and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the  scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.    “But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.  Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.  But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my  sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of  pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can  never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by  the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”    When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely  to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and  always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that  they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers  had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as  made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which  she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a  violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to  the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still  less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were  much too full of lines under the words to be made public.    After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good  humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore  a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came  back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet  was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of  June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without  tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by  the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to  mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious  arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in  Meryton.    The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast  approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter  arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and  curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from  setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again  within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so  far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with  the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up  the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the  present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that  county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three  weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The  town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where  they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of  her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,  Dovedale, or the Peak.    Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing  the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it  was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;  and all was soon right again.    With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was  impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its  owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,  and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”    The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away  before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.  and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at  Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two  younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their  cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and  sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every  way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.    The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the  next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.  One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;  a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear  inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection  and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were  disappointments abroad.    It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,  nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither  lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are  sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present  concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's  former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance  still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the  principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,  Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not  in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In  talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed  an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his  willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.    “My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard  so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your  acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you  know.”    Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at  Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She  must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so  many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.    Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house  richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but  the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the  country.”    Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The  possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly  occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and  thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such  a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved  that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the  absence of the family were unfavourably answered.    Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid  whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its  proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for  the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her  alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of  curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the  next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and  with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike  to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.        Chapter 43      Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of  Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned  in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.    The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They  entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through  a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.    Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired  every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for  half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable  eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by  Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which  the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone  building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of  high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was  swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks  were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She  had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural  beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were  all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that  to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!    They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,  while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of  meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been  mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the  hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to  wonder at her being where she was.    The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less  fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They  followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned  room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went  to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which  they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,  was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and  she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its  banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,  with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking  different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be  seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to  the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of  his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of  splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.    “And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With  these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of  viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and  welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”--recollecting  herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to  me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”    This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like  regret.    She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really  absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question  was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.  Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with  a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own  journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!    Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the  likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,  over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.  The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young  gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought  up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added;  “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”    Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not  return it.    “And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,  “is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the  other--about eight years ago.”    “I have heard much of your master's fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,  looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell  us whether it is like or not.”    Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this  intimation of her knowing her master.    “Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”    Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”    “And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?”    “Yes, very handsome.”    “I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you  will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late  master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to  be then. He was very fond of them.”    This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.    Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn  when she was only eight years old.    “And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.    “Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so  accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is  a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she  comes here to-morrow with him.”    Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her  communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either  by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her  master and his sister.    “Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”    “Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his  time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”    “Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”    “If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”    “Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is  good enough for him.”    Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is  very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”    “I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,”   replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she  listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have  never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever  since he was four years old.”    This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her  ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.  Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was  grateful to her uncle for saying:    “There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in  having such a master.”    “Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could  not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are  good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and  he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the  world.”    Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.    “His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.    “Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just  as affable to the poor.”    Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.  Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects  of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the  furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family  prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her  master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his  many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.    “He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever  lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but  themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give  him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw  anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away  like other young men.”    “In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.    “This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not  quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”    “Perhaps we might be deceived.”    “That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”    On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty  sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than  the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to  give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when  last at Pemberley.    “He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards  one of the windows.    Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter  the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever  can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There  is nothing he would not do for her.”    The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were  all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;  but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already  visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss  Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and  also more intelligible.    In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have  little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of  the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested  her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a  smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he  looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest  contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.  Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's  lifetime.    There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle  sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of  their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds  was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise  of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she  considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how  much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of  good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought  forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she  stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his  eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of  gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and  softened its impropriety of expression.    When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,  they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were  consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.    As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back  to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former  was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself  suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.    They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his  appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes  instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest  blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from  surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,  and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least  of perfect civility.    She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,  received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be  overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture  they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two  that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on  beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little  aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,  scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer  she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the  alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that  he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the  impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few  minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in  her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent  had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as  to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in  Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the  distraction of his thoughts.    At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few  moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took  leave.    The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but  Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,  followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her  coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the  world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light  might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely  thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he  thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes  sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;  for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted  from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over  the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly  altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was  amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!  Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never  had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What  a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put  his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account  for it.    They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and  every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer  reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time  before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered  mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and  seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she  distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that  one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then  was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in  what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,  she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he  felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was  not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in  seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with  composure.    At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind  aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.    They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,  ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of  the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the  valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading  many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish  of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.  With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.  It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which  brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,  to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed  it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;  it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the  valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,  and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.  Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the  bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,  who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only  of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,  therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house  on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their  progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the  taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the  occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the  man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this  slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment  was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy  approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here  less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before  they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared  for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with  calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,  she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea  lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the  turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw  that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his  politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;  but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when  some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of  Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,  and she said no more.    Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked  her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.  This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;  and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the  acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had  revolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought  she, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of  fashion.”    The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their  relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore  it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he  could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the  connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and  so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into  conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,  could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had  some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most  attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every  expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,  his taste, or his good manners.    The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy  invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he  chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time  to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of  the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was  walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.  Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment  must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and  continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can  it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his  manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a  change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”    After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two  gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to  the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious  water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated  in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found  Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred  her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on  together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him  to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the  place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been  very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that  you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we  left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected  in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that  business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours  before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They  will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some  who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”    Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly  driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last  mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_  mind was not very differently engaged.    “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a  pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow  me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance  during your stay at Lambton?”    The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great  for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt  that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her  must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was  satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made  him think really ill of her.    They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth  was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and  pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of  the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had  reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a  mile behind.    He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not  tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might  have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but  there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected  that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale  with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her  patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was  over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go  into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and  they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the  ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him  walking slowly towards the house.    The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them  pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.  “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.    “There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her  aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now  say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I  have seen nothing of it.”    “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more  than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such  attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”    “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;  or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features  are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so  disagreeable?”    Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked  him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never  seen him so pleasant as this morning.    “But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied  her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him  at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off  his grounds.”    Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but  said nothing.    “From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really  should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by  anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.  On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he  speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would  not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the  good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!  I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal  master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every  virtue.”    Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of  his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in  as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from  his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different  construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor  Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In  confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary  transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming  her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.    Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now  approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to  the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out  to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of  anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they  had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former  acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an  intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.    The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth  much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing  but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above  all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.        Chapter 44      Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit  her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently  resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.  But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their  arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the  place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn  to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a  carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in  a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing  the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her  surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she  expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment  of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many  of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on  the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that  there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a  quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these  newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of  Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite  amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,  she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much  in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally  suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.    She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked  up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of  inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.    Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction  took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new  acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her  being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;  but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was  only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from  her beyond a monosyllable.    Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though  little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance  womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there  was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly  unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as  acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much  relieved by discerning such different feelings.    They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley  was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her  satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick  step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All  Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still  felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected  cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He  inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked  and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.    To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage  than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before  them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just  arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards  each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from  those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew  what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little  in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was  evident enough.    Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the  feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and  to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she  feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she  endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley  was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.    In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!  how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in  a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on  former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion  that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,  though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his  behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look  appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred  between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point  she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred  ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a  recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying  more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed  to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone  which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since  he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,  he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of  November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”    Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards  took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether  _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,  nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which  gave them meaning.    It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;  but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general  complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed  from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that  the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however  temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When  she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion  of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a  disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the  very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last  lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was  so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly  restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company  of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations  at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from  self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance  could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the  acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw  down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and  Rosings.    Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose  to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing  their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner  at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a  diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,  readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing  how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its  acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,  that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than  any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of  society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for  her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.    Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth  again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to  make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all  this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on  this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their  visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some  satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been  little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her  uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their  favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.    But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was  not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was  much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;  it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to  interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.    Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far  as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could  not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character  from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference  to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known  would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,  however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible  that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four  years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be  hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of  their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had  nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,  it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town  where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he  was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.    With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held  there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the  son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known  fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind  him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.    As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than  the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not  long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;  and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She  certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she  had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,  that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his  valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some  time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened  into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in  his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,  which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,  there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.  It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,  but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and  acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations  accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid  her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most  eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display  of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only  were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent  on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much  pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent  love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a  sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be  exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,  she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how  far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would  be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her  fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of  his addresses.    It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that  such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the  very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a  late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,  by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that  it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following  morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when  she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.    Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been  renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting  some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.        Chapter 45      Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had  originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her  appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how  much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.    On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,  whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows  opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody  hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts  which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.    In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there  with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in  London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with  all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear  of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior  the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,  however, did her justice, and pitied her.    By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,  on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,  succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a  genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind  of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the  others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from  Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she  wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a  short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.    Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,  and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without  calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her  from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an  inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity  of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every  moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she  feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether  she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After  sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss  Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold  inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal  indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.    The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the  entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the  finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many  a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been  given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole  party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the  beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected  them round the table.    While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether  she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the  feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but  a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to  regret that he came.    He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other  gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him  only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to  Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely  resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more  necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she  saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,  and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour  when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive  curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the  smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its  objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions  to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's  entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he  was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded  as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss  Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the  first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:    “Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?  They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”    In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth  instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the  various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;  but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she  presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While  she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened  complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with  confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what  pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would  have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose  Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed  her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in  Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies  and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected  with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's  meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy  was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections  her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very  wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming  hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without  meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss  Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern  for the welfare of his friend.    Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and  as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to  Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able  to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely  recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which  had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have  fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.    Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above  mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss  Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,  behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's  recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not  err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana  without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When  Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to  him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.    “How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she  cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since  the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing  that we should not have known her again.”    However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented  himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than  her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the  summer.    “For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could  see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no  brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose  wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are  tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,  which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything  extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do  not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency  without fashion, which is intolerable.”    Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not  the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always  wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the  success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a  determination of making him speak, she continued:    “I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all  were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect  your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_  a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she  seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at  one time.”    “Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_  was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have  considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”    He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of  having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.    Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their  visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them  both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,  except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked  of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but  himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of  him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's  beginning the subject.        Chapter 46      Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from  Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been  renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but  on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the  receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that  it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as  Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.    They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and  her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by  themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been  written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their  little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;  but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident  agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:    “Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a  most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be  assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.  An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,  from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland  with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our  surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am  very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing  to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step  (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is  disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.  Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How  thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against  him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about  twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at  eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have  passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect  him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of  their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor  mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly  know what I have written.”    Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing  what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the  other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it  had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.    “By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I  wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my  head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest  Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,  and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham  and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has  taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone  to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the  day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short  letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna  Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.  never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was  repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.  intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,  but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney  coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that  is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.  I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that  side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing  them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but  without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With  the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions  to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved  for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our  distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the  worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make  it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue  their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a  young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose  her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that  Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his  head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to  be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she  exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And  as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has  anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of  confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you  have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the  first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not  so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I  take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but  circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to  come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,  that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something  more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel  Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure  I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any  measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to  be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my  uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will  immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”    “Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat  as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing  a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was  opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous  manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,  she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,  hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find  Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not  an instant to lose.”    “Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than  politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;  but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are  not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”    Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how  little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back  the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless  an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and  mistress home instantly.    On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and  looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,  or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,  “Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you  present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”    “No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There  is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by  some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”    She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could  not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say  something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate  silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane,  with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger  sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into  the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.  _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no  connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”    Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet  more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what  he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I  learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not  have happened. But it is all--all too late now.”    “I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked. But is it  certain--absolutely certain?”    “Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced  almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to  Scotland.”    “And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”    “My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's  immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But  nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is  such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have  not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”    Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.    “When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what  I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too  much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”    Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking  up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air  gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her  power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family  weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither  wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing  consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It  was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own  wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved  him, as now, when all love must be vain.    But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the  humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed  up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,  Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of  several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by  the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke  compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been  long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my  stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything  could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to  such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may  seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I  fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley  to-day.”    “Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that  urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as  long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”    He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for  her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present  reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only  one serious, parting look, went away.    As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they  should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as  had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a  retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full  of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those  feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would  formerly have rejoiced in its termination.    If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's  change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if  otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or  unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on  a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been  exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given  somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,  and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other  less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him  go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must  produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched  business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained  a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,  could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least  of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first  letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that  Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry  for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared  incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment  as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose  Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention  of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue  nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.    She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that  Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia  wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one  officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions  raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been  fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and  mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now  feel it!    She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to  share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a  family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and  requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing  could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost  importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.  and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's  account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them  instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their  summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript  of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a  favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply  afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the  first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every  assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked  him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,  everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to  be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?”   cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for  us; was it so?”    “Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.  _That_ is all settled.”    “What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to  prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real  truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”    But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the  hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure  to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was  impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of  business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to  be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their  sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.  Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing  remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of  the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could  have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.        Chapter 47      “I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they  drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much  more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the  matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should  form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or  friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I  am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends  would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the  regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is  not adequate to the risk!”    “Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.    “Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle's  opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and  interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of  Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe  him capable of it?”    “Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other  neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I  dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been  the case?”    “In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof  that they are not gone to Scotland.”    “Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such  a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the  Barnet road.”    “Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though  for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is  not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it  might strike them that they could be more economically, though less  expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”    “But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their  marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular  friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending  to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He  cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she  beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,  forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what  restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a  dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know  nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your  other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has  no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's  behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever  seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would  do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in  such a matter.”    “But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him  as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”    “It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with  tears in her eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such  a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.  Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never  been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,  nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement  and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle  and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.  Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,  flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing  everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give  greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are  naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of  person and address that can captivate a woman.”    “But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of  Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”    “Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be  their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,  till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what  Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every  sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is  as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”    “And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity  as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.    “I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day,  of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at  Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved  with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other  circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to  relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From  what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,  reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He  must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found  her.”    “But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you  and Jane seem so well to understand?”    “Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw  so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was  ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire  was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the  case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it  necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could  it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the  neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was  settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening  her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be  in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a  consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far  enough from my thoughts.”    “When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I  suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”    “Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either  side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware  that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first  he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all  were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for  the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular  attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and  wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,  who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”                              * * * * *    It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added  to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by  its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during  the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.  Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find  no interval of ease or forgetfulness.    They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night  on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a  comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied  by long expectations.    The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing  on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the  carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their  faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of  capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.    Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,  hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her  mother's apartment, immediately met her.    Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the  eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been  heard of the fugitives.    “Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope  everything will be well.”    “Is my father in town?”    “Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”    “And have you heard from him often?”    “We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say  that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I  particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write  again till he had something of importance to mention.”    “And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”    “My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly  shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you  all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank  Heaven, are quite well.”    “But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you  must have gone through!”    Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their  conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were  engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach  of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and  thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.    When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth  had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon  found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of  good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet  deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that  every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,  to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.    Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'  conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with  tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous  conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;  blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the  errors of her daughter must principally be owing.    “If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton,  with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia  had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out  of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their  side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been  well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the  charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!  And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,  wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become  of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his  grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we  shall do.”    They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after  general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her  that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.  Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.    “Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be  prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we  may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,  and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as  lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make  him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult  together as to what is to be done.”    “Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I  could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,  wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them  marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but  tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,  after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.  Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my  wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such  spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that  I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to  give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does  not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I  know you will contrive it all.”    But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours  in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well  in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till  dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on  the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.    Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real  occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to  oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her  tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it  better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could  most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the  subject.    In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been  too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance  before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The  faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible  in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger  which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of  fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was  mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance  of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:    “This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.  But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of  each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”    Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,  “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful  lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one  false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less  brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in  her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”    Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed  to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such  kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.    In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for  half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of  the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to  satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel  of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss  Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued  the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which  I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel  Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement  took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”    “Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,  especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so  grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He  _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had  any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension  first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”    “And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of  their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”    “Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of  their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not  repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am  inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”    “And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a  doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”    “How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt  a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him  in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite  right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how  imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural  triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter  she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their  being in love with each other, many weeks.”    “But not before they went to Brighton?”    “No, I believe not.”    “And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does  he know his real character?”    “I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly  did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad  affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;  but I hope this may be false.”    “Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,  this could not have happened!”    “Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to expose  the former faults of any person without knowing what their present  feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.”    “Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his  wife?”    “He brought it with him for us to see.”    Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These  were the contents:    “MY DEAR HARRIET,    “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help  laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am  missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,  I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I  love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think  it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my  going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,  when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke  it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to  Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.  Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will  dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall  send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell  Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are  packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will  drink to our good journey.    “Your affectionate friend,    “LYDIA BENNET.”    “Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had  finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!  But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their  journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her  side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”    “I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten  minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in  such confusion!”    “Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who  did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”    “I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is  very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to  give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so  much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen  almost took from me my faculties.”    “Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look  well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety  upon yourself alone.”    “Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every  fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.  Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours  of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn  on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till  Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And  Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to  condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if  they should be of use to us.”    “She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she  _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see  too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence  insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”    She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had  intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.    “He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where  they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could  be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the  number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come  with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a  gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might  be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow  discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he  determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible  to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any  other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,  and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding  out even so much as this.”        Chapter 48      The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next  morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and  dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to  send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.  Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.    When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant  information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,  to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,  to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only  security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.    Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few  days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable  to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a  great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also  visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of  cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without  reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,  she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found  them.    All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months  before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt  to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with  the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.  Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;  and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the  appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above  half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of  her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less  of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come  when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely  despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of  them.    Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a  letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately  found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;  that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,  but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now  determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet  thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first  coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself  did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was  eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.  Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised  to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:    “I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if  possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,  whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to  know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were  anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a  clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have  nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in  his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,  Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any  other person.”    Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her  authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information  of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never  heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both  of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of  his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;  and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application  was a something to look forward to.    Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious  part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters  was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,  whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every  succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.    But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for  their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane  had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,  she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his  letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as  follows:    “MY DEAR SIR,    “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation  in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now  suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from  Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself  sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in  your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because  proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be  wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that  may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the  most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would  have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to  be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte  informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has  proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,  for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think  that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be  guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,  you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined  by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to  whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that  this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of  all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,  will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads  me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event  of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved  in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to  console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child  from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her  own heinous offense.    “I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”    Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from  Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he  kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one  living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he  had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of  particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,  who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the  wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for  secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for  it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a  very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a  thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.  He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more  formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars  from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!”   she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”    Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their  father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered  spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded  to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and  leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable  for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did  not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering  what her anxiety for his life had been before.    “What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he  will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,  and make him marry her, if he comes away?”    As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she  and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet  came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their  journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.    Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her  Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His  name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and  the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their  being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had  received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.    The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for  the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be  fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time  tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware  that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of  Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,  one sleepless night out of two.    When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual  philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the  habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him  away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of  it.    It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that  Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly  expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say  nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,  and I ought to feel it.”    “You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.    “You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone  to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have  been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.  It will pass away soon enough.”    “Do you suppose them to be in London?”    “Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”    “And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.    “She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there  will probably be of some duration.”    Then after a short silence he continued:    “Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me  last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”    They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's  tea.    “This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an  elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my  library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as  I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”    “I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If I should  ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”    “_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne  for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and  you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into  my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be  absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.  And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have  spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”    Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.    “Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good  girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of  them.”        Chapter 49      Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking  together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper  coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their  mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,  when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,  madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some  good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”    “What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”    “Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don't you know  there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here  this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”    Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They  ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the  library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of  seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the  butler, who said:    “If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the  little copse.”    Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once  more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately  pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.    Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as  Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,  came up with him, and eagerly cried out:    “Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”    “Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”    “Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”    “What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from  his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”    Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.    “Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is  about.”    “Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.    “MY DEAR BROTHER,    “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,  upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you  left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of  London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough  to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--”    “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”    Elizabeth read on:    “I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there  was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the  engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will  not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure  to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand  pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and  my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,  during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions  which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,  as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by  express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You  will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's  circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.  The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there  will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to  settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude  will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout  the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to  Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the  smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at  Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as  fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it  best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope  you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as  anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,    “EDW. GARDINER.”    “Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be  possible that he will marry her?”    “Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her  sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”    “And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.    “No; but it must be done soon.”    Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he  wrote.    “Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.  Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”    “Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble  yourself.”    “I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”    And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.    “And may I ask--” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be  complied with.”    “Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”    “And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”    “Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there  are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money  your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever  to pay him.”    “Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”    “I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a  temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am  gone.”    “That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me  before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!  it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has  distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”    “No,” said her father; “Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing  less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,  in the very beginning of our relationship.”    “Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be  repaid?”    Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued  silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the  library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.    “And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they  were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be  thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,  and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”    “I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would  not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind  uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten  thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children  of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand  pounds?”    “If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,” said  Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall  exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has  not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never  be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal  protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as  years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is  actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,  she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she  first sees my aunt!”    “We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said  Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to  marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of  thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself  they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in  time make their past imprudence forgotten.”    “Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor  I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”    It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood  perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,  therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make  it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly  replied:    “Just as you please.”    “May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?”    “Take whatever you like, and get away.”    Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs  together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication  would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,  the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As  soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon  married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its  exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she  had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter  would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her  felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.    “My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She will  be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!  My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage  everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the  clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about  them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him  how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,  Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear  Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”    Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of  these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.  Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.    “For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great  measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to  assist Mr. Wickham with money.”    “Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but  her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children  must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have  ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!  In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well  it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in  such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and  you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money  afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”    She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and  cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had  not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her  father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,  would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite  so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.    “I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the  good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call  on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.  An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do  anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you  heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall  all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”    Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her  congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took  refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.    Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was  no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in  looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could  be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had  feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had  gained.        Chapter 50      Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,  instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for  the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived  him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that  respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever  of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of  prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be  her husband might then have rested in its proper place.    He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone  should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he  was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,  and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.    When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly  useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join  in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow  and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters  successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.  Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he  would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then  too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her  husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their  income.    Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and  the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the  latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with  regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet  could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In  terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,  though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect  approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the  engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed  that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would  be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present  arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the  hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket  allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her  through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within  that sum.    That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was  another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as  little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports  of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he  naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon  dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick  in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he  was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any  message to her.    The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate  speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent  philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage  of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the  happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant  farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the  good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from  all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit  in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery  was considered certain.    It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this  happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in  spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her  triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object  of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of  accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those  attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and  servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a  proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering  what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and  importance.    “Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it--or the  great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is  too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for  Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”    Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the  servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs.  Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and  daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this  neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the  impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”    A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It  soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,  that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his  daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of  affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend  it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable  resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her  marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe  possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new  clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of  shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they  took place.    Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of  the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for  her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the  proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its  unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the  spot.    She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were  few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;  but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's  frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear  of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,  there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been  concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that  Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other  objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the  nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.    From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The  wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his  feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a  blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she  hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no  longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there  seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that  she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they  should meet.    What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the  proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now  have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she  doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,  there must be a triumph.    She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in  disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and  temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It  was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease  and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;  and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she  must have received benefit of greater importance.    But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what  connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and  precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their  family.    How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,  she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could  belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions  were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.                              * * * * *    Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's  acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to  promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties  that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal  purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved  on quitting the militia.    “It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as  his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in  considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on  his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into  the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who  are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an  ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It  is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He  promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each  have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have  written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,  and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham  in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I  have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying  similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin  a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I  hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,  and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,  unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.  Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she  leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to  you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,    “E. GARDINER.”    Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal  from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet  was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,  just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,  for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in  Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a  pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted  with everybody, and had so many favourites.    “She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking  to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she  likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s  regiment.”    His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being  admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,  received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,  who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and  consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,  urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her  and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was  prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their  mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show  her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the  North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent  his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as  the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was  surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and  had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would  have been the last object of her wishes.        Chapter 51      Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her  probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to  meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their  arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,  who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she  been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister  must endure.    They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive  them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to  the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,  anxious, uneasy.    Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and  she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and  welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,  to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an  alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.    Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite  so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely  opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was  enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet  was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,  and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their  congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly  round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and  observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been  there.    Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners  were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been  exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he  claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had  not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,  resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence  of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the  two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.    There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither  of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near  Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,  with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her  replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the  world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led  voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for  the world.    “Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away;  it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things  enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure  I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I  thought it would be very good fun if I was.”    Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked  expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of  which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the  people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;  and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he  should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took  off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that  he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”    Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;  and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to  the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with  anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say  to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go  lower, because I am a married woman.”    It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment  from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good  spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and  all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham”   by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her  ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.    “Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast  room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I  am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half  my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get  husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”    “Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't  at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”    “Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all  things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We  shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some  balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”    “I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.    “And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters  behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the  winter is over.”    “I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not  particularly like your way of getting husbands.”    Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham  had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join  his regiment at the end of a fortnight.    No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and  she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and  having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to  all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did  think, than such as did not.    Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected  to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her  present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that  their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather  than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring  for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain  that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and  if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity  of having a companion.    Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every  occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every  thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on  the first of September, than any body else in the country.    One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two  elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:    “Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You  were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you  curious to hear how it was managed?”    “No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said  on the subject.”    “La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were  married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in  that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven  o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others  were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in  such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to  put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was  my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as  if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in  ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed  to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”    “Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never  be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt  were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe  me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a  fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was  rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so  just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon  business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once  they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I  did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we  were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he  came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,  I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the  wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”    “Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.    “Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious  me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised  them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”    “If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the  subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”    “Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will  ask you no questions.”    “Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you  all, and then Wickham would be angry.”    On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her  power, by running away.    But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least  it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at  her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,  where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her  brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as  placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She  could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,  wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what  Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been  intended.    “You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be  to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively  speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such  a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,  for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems  to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with  ignorance.”    “Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, as she finished  the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable  manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it  out.”    Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to  Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad  of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any  satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.        Chapter 52      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as  soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it  than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to  be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to  be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not  contain a denial.    “Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.    “MY DEAR NIECE,    “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning  to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise  what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your  application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don't think me angry,  however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such  inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to  understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised  as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned  would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really  innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.    “On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most  unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several  hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so  dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.  Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,  and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,  Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day  after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for  them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to  himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to  make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide  in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and  confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private  actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He  called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy  an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_  motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days  in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to  direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness  of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.    “There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago  governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause  of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large  house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting  lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with  Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to  town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he  wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and  corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.  Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had  she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up  their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the  wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and  afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he  acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful  situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed  on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But  he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared  for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear  of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or  other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,  it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,  in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never  been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,  on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and  scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her  own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as  to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He  must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have  nothing to live on.    “Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though  Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able  to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by  marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still  cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in  some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely  to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.    “They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of  course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be  reasonable.    “Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to  make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch  street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be  seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was  still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge  your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your  uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the  departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next  day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.    “On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,  and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.    “They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all  settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to  Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that  obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been  accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.  Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and  I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your  uncle would most readily have settled the whole.    “They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either  the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle  was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his  niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,  which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter  this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation  that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where  it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane  at most.    “You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young  people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably  more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own  settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all  this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It  was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that  Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he  had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth  in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,  can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,  my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would  never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another  interest_ in the affair.    “When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who  were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in  London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were  then to receive the last finish.    “I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which  you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not  afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant  admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I  knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was  satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not  perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming  home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell  you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most  serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had  done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she  heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was  sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and  Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.    “Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,  attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave  town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my  dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold  enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,  in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His  understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little  more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach  him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But  slyness seems the fashion.    “Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not  punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy  till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little  pair of ponies, would be the very thing.    “But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half  hour.    “Yours, very sincerely,    “M. GARDINER.”    The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,  in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the  greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had  produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's  match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too  great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the  pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all  the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which  supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and  despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason  with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to  avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had  done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her  heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly  checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity  was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for  a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so  natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law  of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,  to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had  given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary  stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been  wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and  though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she  could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist  his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially  concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were  under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They  owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!  how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever  encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For  herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause  of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.  She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It  was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some  pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she  and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted  between Mr. Darcy and herself.    She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's  approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was  overtaken by Wickham.    “I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,  as he joined her.    “You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow  that the interruption must be unwelcome.”    “I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and  now we are better.”    “True. Are the others coming out?”    “I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to  Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that  you have actually seen Pemberley.”    She replied in the affirmative.    “I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much  for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the  old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of  me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”    “Yes, she did.”    “And what did she say?”    “That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned  out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely  misrepresented.”    “Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had  silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:    “I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other  several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”    “Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said  Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at this  time of year.”    “Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I  understood from the Gardiners that you had.”    “Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”    “And do you like her?”    “Very much.”    “I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year  or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad  you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”    “I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”    “Did you go by the village of Kympton?”    “I do not recollect that we did.”    “I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A  most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited  me in every respect.”    “How should you have liked making sermons?”    “Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,  and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to  repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The  quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas  of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the  circumstance, when you were in Kent?”    “I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was  left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”    “You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the  first, you may remember.”    “I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not  so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually  declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business  had been compromised accordingly.”    “You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember  what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”    They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast  to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,  she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:    “Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let  us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one  mind.”    She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though  he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.        Chapter 53      Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he  never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,  by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she  had said enough to keep him quiet.    The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was  forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means  entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to  continue at least a twelvemonth.    “Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”    “Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”    “Write to me very often, my dear.”    “As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for  writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to  do.”    Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He  smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.    “He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of  the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to  us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas  himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”    The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.    “I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with  one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”    “This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said  Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are  single.”    “It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,  but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If  that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”    But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly  relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an  article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper  at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her  master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several  weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and  smiled and shook her head by turns.    “Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.  Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not  that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am  sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome  to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?  But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to  mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”    “You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in  Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose  to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He  comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was  going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on  Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”    Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing  colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to  Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:    “I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present  report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from  any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that  I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect  me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes  alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of  _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.”    Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in  Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no  other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial  to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming  there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come  without it.    “Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot  come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this  speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”    In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her  feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily  perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,  more unequal, than she had often seen them.    The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,  about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.    “As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you  will wait on him of course.”    “No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I  went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in  nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.”    His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention  would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to  Netherfield.    “'Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society,  let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours  in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back  again.”    “Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait  on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I  am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will  make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for  him.”    Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her  husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her  neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before  _they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--    “I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It  would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can  hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;  but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she  says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”    “I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it  is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction  of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have  always so much.”    Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,  contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety  and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted  the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;  hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his  arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,  enter the paddock and ride towards the house.    Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely  kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went  to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down  again by her sister.    “There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”    “Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not  know.”    “La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with  him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.”    “Go",50.4,12.4,13.5,9.06,14.8,5.99,2404,10.166666666666666,13.94,13th and 14th grade
25,Bureaucracyr," ten or a dozen lines about the worthy late  director into the papers; his Excellency will glance them over,--he  reads the papers. Do you know the particulars of old La Billardiere’s  life?”    Du Bruel made a sign in the negative.    “No?” continued des Lupeaulx. “Well then; he was mixed up in the affairs  of La Vendee, and he was one of the confidants of the late King. Like  Monsieur le Comte de Fontaine he always refused to hold communication  with the First Consul. He was a bit of a ‘chouan’; born in Brittany of a  parliamentary family, and ennobled by Louis XVIII. How old was he? never  mind about that; just say his loyalty was untarnished, his religion  enlightened,--the poor old fellow hated churches and never set foot  in one, but you had better make him out a ‘pious vassal.’ Bring in,  gracefully, that he sang the song of Simeon at the accession of Charles  X. The Comte d’Artois thought very highly of La Billardiere, for he  co-operated in the unfortunate affair of Quiberon and took the  whole responsibility on himself. You know about that, don’t you? La  Billardiere defended the King in a printed pamphlet in reply to an  impudent history of the Revolution written by a journalist; you can  allude to his loyalty and devotion. But be very careful what you say;  weigh your words, so that the other newspapers can’t laugh at us; and  bring me the article when you’ve written it. Were you at Rabourdin’s  yesterday?”    “Yes, monseigneur,” said du Bruel, “Ah! beg pardon.”    “No harm done,” answered des Lupeaulx, laughing.    “Madame Rabourdin looked delightfully handsome,” added du Bruel. “There  are not two women like her in Paris. Some are as clever as she, but  there’s not one so gracefully witty. Many women may even be handsomer,  but it would be hard to find one with such variety of beauty. Madame  Rabourdin is far superior to Madame Colleville,” said the vaudevillist,  remembering des Lupeaulx’s former affair. “Flavie owes what she is to  the men about her, whereas Madame Rabourdin is all things in herself. It  is wonderful too what she knows; you can’t tell secrets in Latin before  /her/. If I had such a wife, I know I should succeed in everything.”    “You have more mind than an author ought to have,” returned des  Lupeaulx, with a conceited air. Then he turned round and perceived  Dutocq. “Ah, good-morning, Dutocq,” he said. “I sent for you to lend me  your Charlet--if you have the whole complete. Madame la comtesse knows  nothing of Charlet.”    Du Bruel retired.    “Why do you come in without being summoned?” said des Lupeaulx, harshly,  when he and Dutocq were left alone. “Is the State in danger that you  must come here at ten o’clock in the morning, just as I am going to  breakfast with his Excellency?”    “Perhaps it is, monsieur,” said Dutocq, dryly. “If I had had the honor  to see you earlier, you would probably have not been so willing to  support Monsieur Rabourdin, after reading his opinion of you.”    Dutocq opened his coat, took a paper from the left-hand breast-pocket  and laid it on des Lupeaulx’s desk, pointing to a marked passage. Then  he went to the door and slipped the bolt, fearing interruption. While  he was thus employed, the secretary-general read the opening sentence of  the article, which was as follows:      “Monsieur des Lupeaulx. A government degrades itself by openly    employing such a man, whose real vocation is for police diplomacy.    He is fitted to deal with the political filibusters of other    cabinets, and it would be a pity therefore to employ him on our    internal detective police. He is above a common spy, for he is    able to understand a plan; he could skilfully carry through a dark    piece of work and cover his retreat safely.”    Des Lupeaulx was succinctly analyzed in five or six such  paragraphs,--the essence, in fact, of the biographical portrait which  we gave at the beginning of this history. As he read the words the  secretary felt that a man stronger than himself sat in judgment on  him; and he at once resolved to examine the memorandum, which evidently  reached far and high, without allowing Dutocq to know his secret  thoughts. He therefore showed a calm, grave face when the spy returned  to him. Des Lupeaulx, like lawyers, magistrates, diplomatists, and all  whose work obliges them to pry into the human heart, was past being  surprised at anything. Hardened in treachery and in all the tricks and  wiles of hatred, he could take a stab in the back and not let his face  tell of it.    “How did you get hold of this paper?”    Dutocq related his good luck; des Lupeaulx’s face as he listened  expressed no approbation; and the spy ended in terror an account which  began triumphantly.    “Dutocq, you have put your finger between the bark and the tree,” said  the secretary, coldly. “If you don’t want to make powerful enemies I  advise you to keep this paper a profound secret; it is a work of the  utmost importance and already well known to me.”    So saying, des Lupeaulx dismissed Dutocq by one of those glances that  are more expressive than words.    “Ha! that scoundrel of a Rabourdin has put his finger in this!” thought  Dutocq, alarmed on finding himself anticipated; “he has reached the ear  of the administration, while I am left out in the cold. I shouldn’t have  thought it!”    To all his other motives of aversion to Rabourdin he now added the  jealousy of one man to another man of the same calling,--a most powerful  ingredient in hatred.    When des Lupeaulx was left alone, he dropped into a strange meditation.  What power was it of which Rabourdin was the instrument? Should he, des  Lupeaulx, use this singular document to destroy him, or should he keep  it as a weapon to succeed with the wife? The mystery that lay behind  this paper was all darkness to des Lupeaulx, who read with something  akin to terror page after page, in which the men of his acquaintance  were judged with unerring wisdom. He admired Rabourdin, though stabbed  to his vitals by what he said of him. The breakfast-hour suddenly cut  short his meditation.    “His Excellency is waiting for you to come down,” announced the  minister’s footman.    The minister always breakfasted with his wife and children and des  Lupeaulx, without the presence of servants. The morning meal affords the  only moment of privacy which public men can snatch from the current of  overwhelming business. Yet in spite of the precautions they take to keep  this hour for private intimacies and affections, a good many great and  little people manage to infringe upon it. Business itself will, as at  this moment, thrust itself in the way of their scanty comfort.    “I thought Rabourdin was a man above all ordinary petty manoeuvres,”   began the minister; “and yet here, not ten minutes after La  Billardiere’s death, he sends me this note by La Briere,--it is like a  stage missive. Look,” said his Excellency, giving des Lupeaulx a paper  which he was twirling in his fingers.    Too noble in mind to think for a moment of the shameful meaning  La Billardiere’s death might lend to his letter, Rabourdin had not  withdrawn it from La Briere’s hands after the news reached him. Des  Lupeaulx read as follows:--      “Monseigneur,--If twenty-three years of irreproachable services    may claim a favor, I entreat your Excellency to grant me an    audience this very day. My honor is involved in the matter of    which I desire to speak.”    “Poor man!” said des Lupeaulx, in a tone of compassion which confirmed  the minister in his error. “We are alone; I advise you to see him now.  You have a meeting of the Council when the Chamber rises; moreover, your  Excellency has to reply to-day to the opposition; this is really the  only hour when you can receive him.”    Des Lupeaulx rose, called the servant, said a few words, and returned to  his seat. “I have told them to bring him in at dessert,” he said.    Like all other ministers under the Restoration, this particular minister  was a man without youth. The charter granted by Louis XVIII. had the  defect of tying the hands of the kings by compelling them to deliver the  destinies of the nation into the control of the middle-aged men of the  Chamber and the septuagenarians of the peerage; it robbed them of the  right to lay hands on a man of statesmanlike talent wherever they  could find him, no matter how young he was or how poverty-stricken his  condition might be. Napoleon alone was able to employ young men as  he chose, without being restrained by any consideration. After the  overthrow of that mighty will, vigor deserted power. Now the period  when effeminacy succeeds to vigor presents a contrast that is far  more dangerous in France than in other countries. As a general thing,  ministers who were old before they entered office have proved second  or third rate, while those who were taken young have been an honor  to European monarchies and to the republics whose affairs they have  directed. The world still rings with the struggle between Pitt and  Napoleon, two men who conducted the politics of their respective  countries at an age when Henri de Navarre, Richelieu, Mazarin, Colbert,  Louvois, the Prince of Orange, the Guises, Machiavelli, in short, all  the best known of our great men, coming from the ranks or born to  a throne, began to rule the State. The Convention--that model of  energy--was made up in a great measure of young heads; no sovereign  can ever forget that it was able to put fourteen armies into the field  against Europe. Its policy, fatal in the eyes of those who cling to  what is called absolute power, was nevertheless dictated by strictly  monarchical principles, and it behaved itself like any of the great  kings.    After ten or a dozen years of parliamentary struggle, having studied  the science of politics until he was worn down by it, this particular  minister had come to be enthroned by his party, who considered him in  the light of their business man. Happily for him he was now nearer sixty  than fifty years of age; had he retained even a vestige of juvenile  vigor he would quickly have quenched it. But, accustomed to back and  fill, retreat and return to the charge, he was able to endure being  struck at, turn and turn about, by his own party, by the opposition,  by the court, by the clergy, because to all such attacks he opposed the  inert force of a substance which was equally soft and consistent; thus  he reaped the benefits of what was really his misfortune. Harassed by a  thousand questions of government, his mind, like that of an old lawyer  who has tried every species of case, no longer possessed the spring  which solitary minds are able to retain, nor that power of prompt  decision which distinguishes men who are early accustomed to action, and  young soldiers. How could it be otherwise? He had practised sophistries  and quibbled instead of judging; he had criticised effects and done  nothing for causes; his head was full of plans such as a political  party lays upon the shoulders of a leader,--matters of private interest  brought to an orator supposed to have a future, a jumble of schemes and  impractical requests. Far from coming fresh to his work, he was wearied  out with marching and counter-marching, and when he finally reached  the much desired height of his present position, he found himself in  a thicket of thorny bushes with a thousand conflicting wills to  conciliate. If the statesmen of the Restoration had been allowed to  follow out their own ideas, their capacity would doubtless have been  criticised; but though their wills were often forced, their age saved  them from attempting the resistance which youth opposes to intrigues,  both high and low,--intrigues which vanquished Richelieu, and to which,  in a lower sphere, Rabourdin was to succumb.    After the rough and tumble of their first struggles in political life  these men, less old than aged, have to endure the additional wear and  tear of a ministry. Thus it is that their eyes begin to weaken just as  they need to have the clear-sightedness of eagles; their mind is weary  when its youth and fire need to be redoubled. The minister in whom  Rabourdin sought to confide was in the habit of listening to men  of undoubted superiority as they explained ingenious theories of  government, applicable or inapplicable to the affairs of France. Such  men, by whom the difficulties of national policy were never apprehended,  were in the habit of attacking this minister personally whenever a  parliamentary battle or a contest with the secret follies of the court  took place,--on the eve of a struggle with the popular mind, or on the  morrow of a diplomatic discussion which divided the Council into three  separate parties. Caught in such a predicament, a statesman naturally  keeps a yawn ready for the first sentence designed to show him how the  public service could be better managed. At such periods not a dinner  took place among bold schemers or financial and political lobbyists  where the opinions of the Bourse and the Bank, the secrets of diplomacy,  and the policy necessitated by the state of affairs in Europe were not  canvassed and discussed. The minister has his own private councillors in  des Lupeaulx and his secretary, who collected and pondered all opinions  and discussions for the purpose of analyzing and controlling the various  interests proclaimed and supported by so many clever men. In fact, his  misfortune was that of most other ministers who have passed the prime  of life; he trimmed and shuffled under all his difficulties,--with  journalism, which at this period it was thought advisable to repress  in an underhand way rather than fight openly; with financial as well as  labor questions; with the clergy as well as with that other question  of the public lands; with liberalism as with the Chamber. After  manoeuvering his way to power in the course of seven years, the minister  believed that he could manage all questions of administration in the  same way. It is so natural to think we can maintain a position by the  same methods which served us to reach it that no one ventured to blame  a system invented by mediocrity to please minds of its own calibre. The  Restoration, like the Polish revolution, proved to nations as to princes  the true value of a Man, and what will happen if that necessary man is  wanting. The last and the greatest weakness of the public men of the  Restoration was their honesty, in a struggle in which their adversaries  employed the resources of political dishonesty, lies, and calumnies,  and let loose upon them, by all subversive means, the clamor of the  unintelligent masses, able only to understand revolt.    Rabourdin told himself all these things. But he had made up his mind  to win or lose, like a man weary of gambling who allows himself a last  stake; ill-luck had given him as adversary in the game a sharper like  des Lupeaulx. With all his sagacity, Rabourdin was better versed in  matters of administration than in parliamentary optics, and he was far  indeed from imagining how his confidence would be received; he little  thought that the great work that filled his mind would seem to the  minister nothing more than a theory, and that a man who held the  position of a statesman would confound his reform with the schemes of  political and self-interested talkers.    As the minister rose from table, thinking of Francois Keller, his wife  detained him with the offer of a bunch of grapes, and at that moment  Rabourdin was announced. Des Lupeaulx had counted on the minister’s  preoccupation and his desire to get away; seeing him for the moment  occupied with his wife, the general-secretary went forward to meet  Rabourdin; whom he petrified with his first words, said in a low tone of  voice:--    “His Excellency and I know what the subject is that occupies your mind;  you have nothing to fear”; then, raising his voice, he added, “neither  from Dutocq nor from any one else.”    “Don’t feel uneasy, Rabourdin,” said his Excellency, kindly, but making  a movement to get away.    Rabourdin came forward respectfully, and the minister could not evade  him.    “Will your Excellency permit me to see you for a moment in private?” he  said, with a mysterious glance.    The minister looked at the clock and went towards the window, whither  the poor man followed him.    “When may I have the honor of submitting the matter of which I spoke to  your Excellency? I desire to fully explain the plan of administration to  which the paper that was taken belongs--”    “Plan of administration!” exclaimed the minister, frowning, and  hurriedly interrupting him. “If you have anything of that kind to  communicate you must wait for the regular day when we do business  together. I ought to be at the Council now; and I have an answer to  make to the Chamber on that point which the opposition raised before the  session ended yesterday. Your day is Wednesday next; I could not work  yesterday, for I had other things to attend to; political matters are  apt to interfere with purely administrative ones.”    “I place my honor with all confidence in your Excellency’s hands,” said  Rabourdin gravely, “and I entreat you to remember that you have not  allowed me time to give you an immediate explanation of the stolen  paper--”    “Don’t be uneasy,” said des Lupeaulx, interposing between the minister  and Rabourdin, whom he thus interrupted; “in another week you will  probably be appointed--”    The minister smiled as he thought of des Lupeaulx’s enthusiasm for  Madame Rabourdin, and he glanced knowingly at his wife. Rabourdin saw  the look, and tried to imagine its meaning; his attention was diverted  for a moment, and his Excellency took advantage of the fact to make his  escape.    “We will talk of all this, you and I,” said des Lupeaulx, with whom  Rabourdin, much to his surprise, now found himself alone. “Don’t be  angry with Dutocq; I’ll answer for his discretion.”    “Madame Rabourdin is charming,” said the minister’s wife, wishing to say  the civil thing to the head of a bureau.    The children all gazed at Rabourdin with curiosity. The poor man had  come there expecting some serious, even solemn, result, and he was like  a great fish caught in the threads of a flimsy net; he struggled with  himself.    “Madame la comtesse is very good,” he said.    “Shall I not have the pleasure of seeing Madame here some Wednesday?”   said the countess. “Pray bring her; it will give me pleasure.”    “Madame Rabourdin herself receives on Wednesdays,” interrupted des  Lupeaulx, who knew the empty civility of an invitation to the official  Wednesdays; “but since you are so kind as to wish for her, you will soon  give one of your private parties, and--”    The countess rose with some irritation.    “You are the master of my ceremonies,” she said to des  Lupeaulx,--ambiguous words, by which she expressed the annoyance she  felt with the secretary for presuming to interfere with her private  parties, to which she admitted only a select few. She left the room  without bowing to Rabourdin, who remained alone with des Lupeaulx;  the latter was twisting in his fingers the confidential letter to  the minister which Rabourdin had intrusted to La Briere. Rabourdin  recognized it.    “You have never really known me,” said des Lupeaulx. “Friday evening  we will come to a full understanding. Just now I must go and receive  callers; his Excellency saddles me with that burden when he has other  matters to attend to. But I repeat, Rabourdin, don’t worry yourself; you  have nothing to fear.”    Rabourdin walked slowly through the corridors, amazed and confounded by  this singular turn of events. He had expected Dutocq to denounce him,  and found he had not been mistaken; des Lupeaulx had certainly seen the  document which judged him so severely, and yet des Lupeaulx was fawning  on his judge! It was all incomprehensible. Men of upright minds are  often at a loss to understand complicated intrigues, and Rabourdin was  lost in a maze of conjecture without being able to discover the object  of the game which the secretary was playing.    “Either he has not read the part about himself, or he loves my wife.”    Such were the two thoughts to which his mind arrived as he crossed the  courtyard; for the glance he had intercepted the night before between  des Lupeaulx and Celestine came back to his memory like a flash of  lightning.          CHAPTER VI. THE WORMS AT WORK      Rabourdin’s bureau was during his absence a prey to the keenest  excitement; for the relation between the head officials and the clerks  in a government office is so regulated that, when a minister’s messenger  summons the head of a bureau to his Excellency’s presence (above all at  the latter’s breakfast hour), there is no end to the comments that are  made. The fact that the present unusual summons followed so closely  on the death of Monsieur de la Billardiere seemed to give special  importance to the circumstance, which was made known to Monsieur  Saillard, who came at once to confer with Baudoyer. Bixiou, who happened  at the moment to be at work with the latter, left him to converse with  his father-in-law and betook himself to the bureau Rabourdin, where the  usual routine was of course interrupted.    Bixiou [entering]. “I thought I should find you at a white heat! Don’t  you know what’s going on down below? The virtuous woman is done for!  yes, done for, crushed! Terrible scene at the ministry!”    Dutocq [looking fixedly at him]. “Are you telling the truth?”    Bixiou. “Pray, who would regret it? Not you, certainly, for you will be  made under-head-clerk and du Bruel head of the bureau. Monsieur Baudoyer  gets the division.”    Fleury. “I’ll bet a hundred francs that Baudoyer will never be head of  the division.”    Vimeux. “I’ll join in the bet; will you, Monsieur Poiret?”    Poiret. “I retire in January.”    Bixiou. “Is it possible? are we to lose the sight of those shoe-ties?  What will the ministry be without you? Will nobody take up the bet on my  side?”    Dutocq. “I can’t, for I know the facts. Monsieur Rabourdin is appointed.  Monsieur de la Billardiere requested it of the two ministers on his  death-bed, blaming himself for having taken the emoluments of an office  of which Rabourdin did all the work; he felt remorse of conscience, and  the ministers, to quiet him, promised to appoint Rabourdin unless higher  powers intervened.”    Bixiou. “Gentlemen, are you all against me? seven to one,--for I know  which side you’ll take, Monsieur Phellion. Well, I’ll bet a dinner  costing five hundred francs at the Rocher de Cancale that Rabourdin does  not get La Billardiere’s place. That will cost you only a hundred francs  each, and I’m risking five hundred,--five to one against me! Do you take  it up?” [Shouting into the next room.] “Du Bruel, what say you?”    Phellion [laying down his pen]. “Monsieur, may I ask on what you base  that contingent proposal?--for contingent it is. But stay, I am wrong  to call it a proposal; I should say contract. A wager constitutes a  contract.”    Fleury. “No, no; you can only apply the word ‘contract’ to agreements  that are recognized in the Code. Now the Code allows of no action for  the recovery of a bet.”    Dutocq. “Proscribe a thing and you recognize it.”    Bixiou. “Good! my little man.”    Poiret. “Dear me!”    Fleury. “True! when one refuses to pay one’s debts, that’s recognizing  them.”    Thuillier. “You would make famous lawyers.”    Poiret. “I am as curious as Monsieur Phellion to know what grounds  Monsieur Bixiou has for--”    Bixiou [shouting across the office]. “Du Bruel! Will you bet?”    Du Bruel [appearing at the door]. “Heavens and earth, gentlemen, I’m  very busy; I have something very difficult to do; I’ve got to write an  obituary notice of Monsieur de la Billardiere. I do beg you to be quiet;  you can laugh and bet afterwards.”    Bixiou. “That’s true, du Bruel; the praise of an honest man is a very  difficult thing to write. I’d rather any day draw a caricature of him.”    Du Bruel. “Do come and help me, Bixiou.”    Bixiou [following him]. “I’m willing; though I can do such things much  better when eating.”    Du Bruel. “Well, we will go and dine together afterwards. But listen,  this is what I have written” [reads] “‘The Church and the Monarchy are  daily losing many of those who fought for them in Revolutionary times.’”    Bixiou. “Bad, very bad; why don’t you say, ‘Death carries on its ravages  amongst the few surviving defenders of the monarchy and the old and  faithful servants of the King, whose heart bleeds under these reiterated  blows?’” [Du Bruel writes rapidly.] “‘Monsieur le Baron Flamet de la  Billardiere died this morning of dropsy, caused by heart disease.’ You  see, it is just as well to show there are hearts in government offices;  and you ought to slip in a little flummery about the emotions of the  Royalists during the Terror,--might be useful, hey! But stay,--no!  the petty papers would be sure to say the emotions came more from the  stomach than the heart. Better leave that out. What are you writing  now?”    Du Bruel [reading]. “‘Issuing from an old parliamentary stock in which  devotion to the throne was hereditary, as was also attachment to the  faith of our fathers, Monsieur de la Billardiere--’”    Bixiou. “Better say Monsieur le Baron de la Billardiere.”    Du Bruel. “But he wasn’t baron in 1793.”    Bixiou. “No matter. Don’t you remember that under the Empire Fouche  was telling an anecdote about the Convention, in which he had to quote  Robespierre, and he said, ‘Robespierre called out to me, “Duc d’Otrante,  go to the Hotel de Ville.”’ There’s a precedent for you!”    Du Bruel. “Let me just write that down; I can use it in a  vaudeville.--But to go back to what we were saying. I don’t want to put  ‘Monsieur le baron,’ because I am reserving his honors till the last,  when they rained upon him.”    Bixiou. “Oh! very good; that’s theatrical,--the finale of the article.”    Du Bruel [continuing]. “‘In appointing Monsieur de la Billardiere  gentleman-in-ordinary--’”    Bixiou. “Very ordinary!”    Du Bruel. “‘--of the Bedchamber, the King rewarded not only the services  rendered by the Provost, who knew how to harmonize the severity of his  functions with the customary urbanity of the Bourbons, but the bravery  of the Vendean hero, who never bent the knee to the imperial idol. He  leaves a son, who inherits his loyalty and his talents.’”    Bixiou. “Don’t you think all that is a little too florid? I should tone  down the poetry. ‘Imperial idol!’ ‘bent the knee!’ damn it, my dear  fellow, writing vaudevilles has ruined your style; you can’t come down  to pedestrial prose. I should say, ‘He belonged to the small number of  those who.’ Simplify, simplify! the man himself was a simpleton.”    Du Bruel. “That’s vaudeville, if you like! You would make your fortune  at the theatre, Bixiou.”    Bixiou. “What have you said about Quiberon?” [Reads over du Bruel’s  shoulder.] “Oh, that won’t do! Here, this is what you must say: ‘He took  upon himself, in a book recently published, the responsibility for all  the blunders of the expedition to Quiberon,--thus proving the nature of  his loyalty, which did not shrink from any sacrifice.’ That’s clever and  witty, and exalts La Billardiere.”    Du Bruel. “At whose expense?”    Bixiou [solemn as a priest in a pulpit]. “Why, Hoche and Tallien, of  course; don’t you read history?”    Du Bruel. “No. I subscribed to the Baudouin series, but I’ve never had  time to open a volume; one can’t find matter for vaudevilles there.”    Phellion [at the door]. “We all want to know, Monsieur Bixiou, what made  you think that the worthy and honorable Monsieur Rabourdin, who has so  long done the work of this division for Monsieur de la Billardiere,--he,  who is the senior head of all the bureaus, and whom, moreover, the  minister summoned as soon as he heard of the departure of the late  Monsieur de la Billardiere,--will not be appointed head of the  division.”    Bixiou. “Papa Phellion, you know geography?”    Phellion [bridling up]. “I should say so!”    Bixiou. “And history?”    Phellion [affecting modesty]. “Possibly.”    Bixiou [looking fixedly at him]. “Your diamond pin is loose, it is  coming out. Well, you may know all that, but you don’t know the human  heart; you have gone no further in the geography and history of that  organ than you have in the environs of the city of Paris.”    Poiret [to Vimeux]. “Environs of Paris? I thought they were talking of  Monsieur Rabourdin.”    Bixiou. “About that bet? Does the entire bureau Rabourdin bet against  me?”    All. “Yes.”    Bixiou. “Du Bruel, do you count in?”    Du Bruel. “Of course I do. We want Rabourdin to go up a step and make  room for others.”    Bixiou. “Well, I accept the bet,--for this reason; you can hardly  understand it, but I’ll tell it to you all the same. It would be right  and just to appoint Monsieur Rabourdin” [looking full at Dutocq],  “because, in that case, long and faithful service, honor, and talent  would be recognized, appreciated, and properly rewarded. Such an  appointment is in the best interests of the administration.” [Phellion,  Poiret, and Thuillier listen stupidly, with the look of those who try  to peer before them in the darkness.] “Well, it is just because the  promotion would be so fitting, and because the man has such merit,  and because the measure is so eminently wise and equitable that I bet  Rabourdin will not be appointed. Yes, you’ll see, that appointment will  slip up, just like the invasion from Boulogne, and the march to Russia,  for the success of which a great genius has gathered together all the  chances. It will fail as all good and just things do fail in this low  world. I am only backing the devil’s game.”    Du Bruel. “Who do you think will be appointed?”    Bixiou. “The more I think about Baudoyer, the more sure I feel that he  unites all the opposite qualities; therefore I think he will be the next  head of this division.”    Dutocq. “But Monsieur des Lupeaulx, who sent for me to borrow my  Charlet, told me positively that Monsieur Rabourdin was appointed, and  that the little La Billardiere would be made Clerk of the Seals.”    Bixiou. “Appointed, indeed! The appointment can’t be made and signed  under ten days. It will certainly not be known before New-Year’s day.  There he goes now across the courtyard; look at him, and say if the  virtuous Rabourdin looks like a man in the sunshine of favor. I should  say he knows he’s dismissed.” [Fleury rushes to the window.] “Gentlemen,  adieu; I’ll go and tell Monsieur Baudoyer that I hear from you that  Rabourdin is appointed; it will make him furious, the pious creature!  Then I’ll tell him of our wager, to cool him down,--a process we call at  the theatre turning the Wheel of Fortune, don’t we, du Bruel? Why do I  care who gets the place? simply because if Baudoyer does he will make me  under-head-clerk” [goes out].    Poiret. “Everybody says that man is clever, but as for me, I can never  understand a word he says” [goes on copying]. “I listen and listen; I  hear words, but I never get at any meaning; he talks about the environs  of Paris when he discusses the human heart and” [lays down his pen and  goes to the stove] “declares he backs the devil’s game when it is a  question of Russia and Boulogne; now what is there so clever in that,  I’d like to know? We must first admit that the devil plays any game at  all, and then find out what game; possibly dominoes” [blows his nose].    Fleury [interrupting]. “Pere Poiret is blowing his nose; it must be  eleven o’clock.”    Du Bruel. “So it is! Goodness! I’m off to the secretary; he wants to  read the obituary.”    Poiret. “What was I saying?”    Thuillier. “Dominoes,--perhaps the devil plays dominoes.” [Sebastien  enters to gather up the different papers and circulars for signature.]    Vimeux. “Ah! there you are, my fine young man. Your days of hardship are  nearly over; you’ll get a post. Monsieur Rabourdin will be appointed.  Weren’t you at Madame Rabourdin’s last night? Lucky fellow! they say  that really superb women go there.”    Sebastien. “Do they? I didn’t know.”    Fleury. “Are you blind?”    Sebastien. “I don’t like to look at what I ought not to see.”    Phellion [delighted]. “Well said, young man!”    Vimeux. “The devil! well, you looked at Madame Rabourdin enough, any  how; a charming woman.”    Fleury. “Pooh! thin as a rail. I saw her in the Tuileries, and I much  prefer Percilliee, the ballet-mistress, Castaing’s victim.”    Phellion. “What has an actress to do with the wife of a government  official?”    Dutocq. “They both play comedy.”    Fleury [looking askance at Dutocq]. “The physical has nothing to do with  the moral, and if you mean--”    Dutocq. “I mean nothing.”    Fleury. “Do you all want to know which of us will really be made head of  this bureau?”    All. “Yes, tell us.”    Fleury. “Colleville.”    Thuillier. “Why?”    Fleury. “Because Madame Colleville has taken the shortest way to  it--through the sacristy.”    Thuillier. “I am too much Colleville’s friend not to beg you, Monsieur  Fleury, to speak respectfully of his wife.”    Phellion. “A defenceless woman should never be made the subject of  conversation here--”    Vimeux. “All the more because the charming Madame Colleville won’t  invite Fleury to her house. He backbites her in revenge.”    Fleury. “She may not receive me on the same footing that she does  Thuillier, but I go there--”    Thuillier. “When? how?--under her windows?”    Though Fleury was dreaded as a bully in all the offices, he received  Thuillier’s speech in silence. This meekness, which surprised the other  clerks, was owing to a certain note for two hundred francs, of doubtful  value, which Thuillier agreed to pass over to his sister. After this  skirmish dead silence prevailed. They all wrote steadily from one to  three o’clock. Du Bruel did not return.    About half-past three the usual preparations for departure, the brushing  of hats, the changing of coats, went on in all the ministerial offices.  That precious thirty minutes thus employed served to shorten by just so  much the day’s labor. At this hour the over-heated rooms cool off;  the peculiar odor that hangs about the bureaus evaporates; silence  is restored. By four o’clock none but a few clerks who do their duty  conscientiously remain. A minister may know who are the real workers  under him if he will take the trouble to walk through the divisions  after four o’clock,--a species of prying, however, that no one of his  dignity would condescend to.    The various heads of divisions and bureaus usually encountered each  other in the courtyards at this hour and exchanged opinions on the  events of the day. On this occasion they departed by twos and threes,  most of them agreeing in favor of Rabourdin; while the old stagers,  like Monsieur Clergeot, shook their heads and said, “Habent sua sidera  lites.” Saillard and Baudoyer were politely avoided, for nobody knew  what to say to them about La Billardiere’s death, it being fully  understood that Baudoyer wanted the place, though it was certainly not  due to him.    When Saillard and his son-in-law had gone a certain distance from the  ministry the former broke silence and said: “Things look badly for you,  my poor Baudoyer.”    “I can’t understand,” replied the other, “what Elisabeth was dreaming  of when she sent Godard in such a hurry to get a passport for Falleix;  Godard tells me she hired a post-chaise by the advice of my uncle  Mitral, and that Falleix has already started for his own part of the  country.”    “Some matter connected with our business,” suggested Saillard.    “Our most pressing business just now is to look after Monsieur La  Billardiere’s place,” returned Baudoyer, crossly.    They were just then near the entrance of the Palais-Royal on the rue  Saint-Honore. Dutocq came up, bowing, and joined them.    “Monsieur,” he said to Baudoyer, “if I can be useful to you in any way  under the circumstances in which you find yourself, pray command me, for  I am not less devoted to your interests than Monsieur Godard.”    “Such an assurance is at least consoling,” replied Baudoyer; “it makes  me aware that I have the confidence of honest men.”    “If you would kindly employ your influence to get me placed in  your division, taking Bixiou as head of the bureau and me as  under-head-clerk, you will secure the future of two men who are ready to  do anything for your advancement.”    “Are you making fun of us, monsieur?” asked Saillard, staring at him  stupidly.    “Far be it from me to do that,” said Dutocq. “I have just come from the  printing-office of the ministerial journal (where I carried from the  general-secretary an obituary notice of Monsieur de la Billardiere), and  I there read an article which will appear to-night about you, which has  given me the highest opinion of your character and talents. If it is  necessary to crush Rabourdin, I’m in a position to give him the final  blow; please to remember that.”    Dutocq disappeared.    “May I be shot if I understand a single word of it,” said Saillard,  looking at Baudoyer, whose little eyes were expressive of stupid  bewilderment. “I must buy the newspaper to-night.”    When the two reached home and entered the salon on the ground-floor,  they found a large fire lighted, and Madame Saillard, Elisabeth,  Monsieur Gaudron and the curate of Saint-Paul’s sitting by it. The  curate turned at once to Monsieur Baudoyer, to whom Elisabeth made a  sign which he failed to understand.    “Monsieur,” said the curate, “I have lost no time in coming in person to  thank you for the magnificent gift with which you have adorned my poor  church. I dared not run in debt to buy that beautiful monstrance,  worthy of a cathedral. You, who are one of our most pious and faithful  parishioners, must have keenly felt the bareness of the high altar. I am  on my way to see Monseigneur the coadjutor, and he will, I am sure, send  you his own thanks later.”    “I have done nothing as yet--” began Baudoyer.    “Monsieur le cure,” interposed his wife, cutting him short. “I see I am  forced to betray the whole secret. Monsieur Baudoyer hopes to complete  the gift by sending you a dais for the coming Fete-Dieu. But the  purchase must depend on the state of our finances, and our finances  depend on my husband’s promotion.”    “God will reward those who honor him,” said Monsieur Gaudron, preparing,  with the curate, to take leave.    “But will you not,” said Saillard to the two ecclesiastics, “do us the  honor to take pot luck with us?”    “You can stay, my dear vicar,” said the curate to Gaudron; “you know I  am engaged to dine with the curate of Saint-Roch, who, by the bye, is to  bury Monsieur de la Billardiere to-morrow.”    “Monsieur le cure de Saint-Roch might say a word for us,” began  Baudoyer. His wife pulled the skirt of his coat violently.    “Do hold your tongue, Baudoyer,” she said, leading him aside and  whispering in his ear. “You have given a monstrance to the church, that  cost five thousand francs. I’ll explain it all later.”    The miserly Baudoyer make a sulky grimace, and continued gloomy and  cross for the rest of the day.    “What did you busy yourself about Falleix’s passport for? Why do you  meddle in other people’s affairs?” he presently asked her.    “I must say, I think Falleix’s affairs are as much ours as his,”   returned Elisabeth, dryly, glancing at her husband to make him notice  Monsieur Gaudron, before whom he ought to be silent.    “Certainly, certainly,” said old Saillard, thinking of his  co-partnership.    “I hope you reached the newspaper office in time?” remarked Elisabeth to  Monsieur Gaudron, as she helped him to soup.    “Yes, my dear lady,” answered the vicar; “when the editor read the  little article I gave him, written by the secretary of the Grand  Almoner, he made no difficulty. He took pains to insert it in a  conspicuous place. I should never have thought of that; but this young  journalist has a wide-awake mind. The defenders of religion can enter  the lists against impiety without disadvantage at the present moment,  for there is a great deal of talent in the royalist press. I have every  reason to believe that success will crown your hopes. But you must  remember, my dear Baudoyer, to promote Monsieur Colleville; he is an  object of great interest to his Eminence; in fact, I am desired to  mention him to you.”    “If I am head of the division, I will make him head of one of my  bureaus, if you want me to,” said Baudoyer.    The matter thus referred to was explained after dinner, when the  ministerial organ (bought and sent up by the porter) proved to contain  among its Paris news the following articles, called items:--      “Monsieur le Baron de la Billardiere died this morning, after a    long and painful illness. The king loses a devoted servant, the    Church a most pious son. Monsieur de la Billardiere’s end has    fitly crowned a noble life, consecrated in dark and troublesome    times to perilous missions, and of late years to arduous civic    duties. Monsieur de la Billardiere was provost of a department,    where his force of character triumphed over all the obstacles that    rebellion arrayed against him. He subsequently accepted the    difficult post of director of a division (in which his great    acquirements were not less useful than the truly French affability    of his manners) for the express purpose of conciliating the    serious interests that arise under its administration. No rewards    have ever been more truly deserved than those by which the King,    Louis XVIII., and his present Majesty took pleasure in crowning a    loyalty which never faltered under the usurper. This old family    still survives in the person of a single heir to the excellent man    whose death now afflicts so many warm friends. His Majesty has    already graciously made known that Monsieur Benjamin de la    Billardiere will be included among the gentlemen-in-ordinary of    the Bedchamber.      “The numerous friends who have not already received their    notification of this sad event are hereby informed that the    funeral will take place to-morrow at four o’clock, in the church    of Saint-Roch. The memorial address will be delivered by Monsieur    l’Abbe Fontanon.”----      “Monsieur Isidore-Charles-Thomas Baudoyer, representing one of the    oldest bourgeois families of Paris, and head of a bureau in the    late Monsieur de la Billardiere’s division, has lately recalled    the old traditions of piety and devotion which formerly    distinguished these great families, so jealous for the honor and    glory of religion, and so faithful in preserving its monuments.    The church of Saint-Paul has long needed a monstrance in keeping    with the magnificence of that basilica, itself due to the Company    of Jesus. Neither the vestry nor the curate were rich enough to    decorate the altar. Monsieur Baudoyer has bestowed upon the parish    a monstrance that many persons have seen and admired at Monsieur    Gohier’s, the king’s jeweller. Thanks to the piety of this    gentleman, who did not shrink from the immensity of the price, the    church of Saint-Paul possesses to-day a masterpiece of the    jeweller’s art designed by Monsieur de Sommervieux. It gives us    pleasure to make known this fact, which proves how powerless the    declamations of liberals have been on the mind of the Parisian    bourgeoisie. The upper ranks of that body have at all times been    royalist and they prove it when occasion offers.”    “The price was five thousand francs,” said the Abbe Gaudron; “but as the  payment was in cash, the court jeweller reduced the amount.”    “Representing one of the oldest bourgeois families in Paris!” Saillard  was saying to himself; “there it is printed,--in the official paper,  too!”    “Dear Monsieur Gaudron,” said Madame Baudoyer, “please help my father to  compose a little speech that he could slip into the countess’s ear when  he takes her the monthly stipend,--a single sentence that would cover  all! I must leave you. I am obliged to go out with my uncle Mitral.  Would you believe it? I was unable to find my uncle Bidault at home this  afternoon. Oh, what a dog-kennel he lives in! But Monsieur Mitral, who  knows his ways, says he does all his business between eight o’clock in  the morning and midday, and that after that hour he can be found only at  a certain cafe called the Cafe Themis,--a singular name.”    “Is justice done there?” said the abbe, laughing.    “Do you ask why he goes to a cafe at the corner of the rue Dauphine and  the quai des Augustins? They say he plays dominoes there every night  with his friend Monsieur Gobseck. I don’t wish to go to such a place  alone; my uncle Mitral will take me there and bring me back.”    At this instant Mitral showed his yellow face, surmounted by a wig which  looked as though it might be made of hay, and made a sign to his niece  to come at once, and not keep a carriage waiting at two francs an hour.  Madame Baudoyer rose and went away without giving any explanation to her  husband or father.    “Heaven has given you in that woman,” said Monsieur Gaudron to Baudoyer  when Elisabeth had disappeared, “a perfect treasure of prudence  and virtue, a model of wisdom, a Christian who gives sure signs of  possessing the Divine spirit. Religion alone is able to form such  perfect characters. To-morrow I shall say a mass for the success of your  good cause. It is all-important, for the sake of the monarchy and of  religion itself that you should receive this appointment. Monsieur  Rabourdin is a liberal; he subscribes to the ‘Journal des Debats,’ a  dangerous newspaper, which made war on Monsieur le Comte de Villele to  please the wounded vanity of Monsieur de Chateaubriand. His Eminence  will read the newspaper to-night, if only to see what is said of his  poor friend Monsieur de la Billardiere; and Monseigneur the coadjutor  will speak of you to the King. When I think of what you have now done  for his dear church, I feel sure he will not forget you in his prayers;  more than that, he is dining at this moment with the coadjutor at the  house of the curate of Saint-Roch.”    These words made Saillard and Baudoyer begin to perceive that Elisabeth  had not been idle ever since Godard had informed her of Monsieur de la  Billardiere’s decease.    “Isn’t she clever, that Elisabeth of mine?” cried Saillard,  comprehending more clearly than Monsieur l’abbe the rapid undermining,  like the path of a mole, which his daughter had undertaken.    “She sent Godard to Rabourdin’s door to find out what newspaper he  takes,” said Gaudron; “and I mentioned the name to the secretary of his  Eminence,--for we live at a crisis when the Church and Throne must keep  themselves informed as to who are their friends and who their enemies.”    “For the last five days I have been trying to find the right thing to  say to his Excellency’s wife,” said Saillard.    “All Paris will read that,” cried Baudoyer, whose eyes were still  riveted on the paper.    “Your eulogy costs us four thousand eight hundred francs, son-in-law!”   exclaimed Madame Saillard.    “You have adorned the house of God,” said the Abbe Gaudron.    “We might have got salvation without doing that,” she returned. “But  if Baudoyer gets the place, which is worth eight thousand more, the  sacrifice is not so great. If he doesn’t get it! hey, papa,” she added,  looking at her husband, “how we shall have bled!--”    “Well, never mind,” said Saillard, enthusiastically, “we can always make  it up through Falleix, who is going to extend his business and use his  brother, whom he has made a stockbroker on purpose. Elisabeth might have  told us, I think, why Falleix went off in such a hurry. But let’s invent  my little speech. This is what I thought of: ‘Madame, if you would say a  word to his Excellency--’”    “‘If you would deign,’” said Gaudron; “add the word ‘deign,’ it is  more respectful. But you ought to know, first of all, whether Madame la  Dauphine will grant you her protection, and then you could suggest to  Madame la comtesse the idea of co-operating with the wishes of her Royal  Highness.”    “You ought to designate the vacant post,” said Baudoyer.    “‘Madame la comtesse,’” began Saillard, rising, and bowing to his wife,  with an agreeable smile.    “Goodness! Saillard; how ridiculous you look. Take care, my man, you’ll  make the woman laugh.”    “‘Madame la comtesse,’” resumed Saillard. “Is that better, wife?”    “Yes, my duck.”    “‘The place of the worthy Monsieur de la Billardiere is vacant; my  son-in-law, Monsieur Baudoyer--’”    “‘Man of talent and extreme piety,’” prompted Gaudron.    “Write it down, Baudoyer,” cried old Saillard, “write that sentence  down.”    Baudoyer proceeded to take a pen and wrote, without a blush, his own  praises, precisely as Nathan or Canalis might have reviewed one of their  own books.    “‘Madame la comtesse’--Don’t you see, mother?” said Saillard to his  wife; “I am supposing you to be the minister’s wife.”    “Do you take me for a fool?” she answered sharply. “I know that.”    “‘The place of the late worthy de la Billardiere is vacant; my  son-in-law, Monsieur Baudoyer, a man of consummate talent and extreme  piety--’” After looking at Monsieur Gaudron, who was reflecting, he  added, “‘will be very glad if he gets it.’ That’s not bad; it’s brief  and it says the whole thing.”    “But do wait, Saillard; don’t you see that Monsieur l’abbe is turning it  over in his mind?” said Madame Saillard; “don’t disturb him.”    “‘Will be very thankful if you would deign to interest yourself in his  behalf,’” resumed Gaudron. “‘And in saying a word to his Excellency you  will particularly please Madame la Dauphine, by whom he has the honor  and the happiness to be protected.’”    “Ah! Monsieur Gaudron, that sentence is worth more than the monstrance;  I don’t regret the four thousand eight hundred--Besides, Baudoyer, my  lad, you’ll pay them, won’t you? Have you written it all down?”    “I shall make you repeat it, father, morning and evening,” said Madame  Saillard. “Yes, that’s a good speech. How lucky you are, Monsieur  Gaudron, to know so much. That’s what it is to be brought up in a  seminary; they learn there how to speak to God and his saints.”    “He is as good as he is learned,” said Baudoyer, pressing the priest’s  hand. “Did you write that article?” he added, pointing to the newspaper.    “No, it was written by the secretary of his Eminence, a young abbe  who is under obligations to me, and who takes an interest in Monsieur  Colleville; he was educated at my expense.”    “A good deed is always rewarded,” said Baudoyer.    While these four personages were sitting down to their game of boston,  Elisabeth and her uncle Mitral reached the cafe Themis, with much  discourse as they drove along about a matter which Elisabeth’s keen  perceptions told her was the most powerful lever that could be used to  force the minister’s hand in the affair of her husband’s appointment.  Uncle Mitral, a former sheriff’s officer, crafty, clever at sharp  practice, and full of expedients and judicial precautions, believed the  honor of his family to be involved in the appointment of his nephew.  His avarice had long led him to estimate the contents of old Gigonnet’s  strong-box, for he knew very well they would go in the end to benefit  his nephew Baudoyer; and it was therefore important that the latter  should obtain a position which would be in keeping with the combined  fortunes of the Saillards and the old Gigonnet, which would finally  devolve on the Baudoyer’s little daughter; and what an heiress she would  be with an income of a hundred thousand francs! to what social position  might she not aspire with that fortune? He adopted all the ideas of his  niece Elisabeth and thoroughly understood them. He had helped in sending  off Falleix expeditiously, explaining to him the advantage of taking  post horses. After which, while eating his dinner, he reflected that  it be as well to give a twist of his own to the clever plan invented by  Elisabeth.    When they reached the Cafe Themis he told his niece that he alone could  manage Gigonnet in the matter they both had in view, and he made her  wait in the hackney-coach and bide her time to come forward at the right  moment. Elisabeth saw through the window-panes the two faces of Gobseck  and Gigonnet (her uncle Bidault), which stood out in relief against  the yellow wood-work of the old cafe, like two cameo heads, cold and  impassible, in the rigid attitude that their gravity gave them. The two  Parisian misers were surrounded by a number of other old faces, on which  “thirty per cent discount” was written in circular wrinkles that started  from the nose and turned round the glacial cheek-bones. These remarkable  physiognomies brightened up on seeing Mitral, and their eyes gleamed  with tigerish curiosity.    “Hey, hey! it is papa Mitral!” cried one of them, named Chaboisseau, a  little old man who discounted for a publisher.    “Bless me, so it is!” said another, a broker named Metivier, “ha, that’s  an old monkey well up in his tricks.”    “And you,” retorted Mitral, “you are an old crow who knows all about  carcasses.”    “True,” said the stern Gobseck.    “What are you here for? Have you come to seize friend Metivier?” asked  Gigonnet, pointing to the broker, who had the bluff face of a porter.    “Your great-niece Elisabeth is out there, papa Gigonnet,” whispered  Mitral.    “What! some misfortune?” said Bidault. The old man drew his eyebrows  together and assumed a tender look like that of an executioner when  about to go to work officially. In spite of his Roman virtue he must  have been touched, for his red nose lost somewhat of its color.    “Well, suppose it is misfortune, won’t you help Saillard’s daughter?--a  girl who has knitted your stockings for the last thirty years!” cried  Mitral.    “If there’s good security I don’t say I won’t,” replied Gigonnet.  “Falleix is in with them. Falleix has just set up his brother as a  broker, and he is doing as much business as the Brezacs; and what with?  his mind, perhaps! Saillard is no simpleton.”    “He knows the value of money,” put in Chaboisseau.    That remark, uttered among those old men, would have made an artist and  thinker shudder as they all nodded their heads.    “But it is none of my business,” resumed Bidault-Gigonnet. “I’m not  bound to care for my neighbors’ misfortunes. My principle is never to be  off my guard with friends or relatives; you can’t perish except through  weakness. Apply to Gobseck; he is softer.”    The usurers all applauded these doctrines with a shake of their metallic  heads. An onlooker would have fancied he heard the creaking of ill-oiled  machinery.    “Come, Gigonnet, show a little feeling,” said Chaboisseau, “they’ve knit  your stockings for thirty years.”    “That counts for something,” remarked Gobseck.    “Are you all alone? Is it safe to speak?” said Mitral, looking carefully  about him. “I come about a good piece of business.”    “If it is good, why do you come to us?” said Gigonnet, sharply,  interrupting Mitral.    “A fellow who was a gentleman of the Bedchamber,” went on Mitral, “a  former ‘chouan,’--what’s his name?--La Billardiere is dead.”    “True,” said Gobseck.    “And our nephew is giving monstrances to the church,” snarled Gigonnet.    “He is not such a fool as to give them, he sells them, old man,” said  Mitral, proudly. “He wants La Billardiere’s place, and in order to get  it, we must seize--”    “Seize! You’ll never be anything but a sheriff’s officer,” put in  Metivier, striking Mitral amicably on the shoulder; “I like that, I do!”    “Seize Monsieur Clement des Lupeaulx in our clutches,” continued Mitral;  “Elisabeth has discovered how to do it, and he is--”    “Elisabeth”; cried Gigonnet, interrupting again; “dear little creature!  she takes after her grandfather, my poor brother! he never had his  equal! Ah, you should have seen him buying up old furniture; what tact!  what shrewdness! What does Elisabeth want?”    “Hey! hey!” cried Mitral, “you’ve got back your bowels of compassion,  papa Gigonnet! That phenomenon has a cause.”    “Always a child,” said Gobseck to Gigonnet, “you are too quick on the  trigger.”    “Come, Gobseck and Gigonnet, listen to me; you want to keep well with  des Lupeaulx, don’t you? You’ve not forgotten how you plucked him in  that affair about the king’s debts, and you are afraid he’ll ask you to  return some of his feathers,” said Mitral.    “Shall we tell him the whole thing?” asked Gobseck, whispering to  Gigonnet.    “Mitral is one of us; he wouldn’t play a shabby trick on his former  customers,” replied Gigonnet. “You see, Mitral,” he went on, speaking to  the ex-sheriff in a low voice, “we three have just bought up all those  debts, the payment of which depends on the decision of the liquidation  committee.”    “How much will you lose?” asked Mitral.    “Nothing,” said Gobseck.    “Nobody knows we are in it,” added Gigonnet; “Samanon screens us.”    “Come, listen to me, Gigonnet; it is cold, and your niece is waiting  outside. You’ll understand what I want in two words. You must at  once, between you, send two hundred and fifty thousand francs (without  interest) into the country after Falleix, who has gone post-haste, with  a courier in advance of him.”    “Is it possible!” said Gobseck.    “What for?” cried Gigonnet, “and where to?”    “To des Lupeaulx’s magnificent country-seat,” replied Mitral. “Falleix  knows the country, for he was born there; and he is going to buy up  land all round the secretary’s miserable hovel, with the two hundred  and fifty thousand francs I speak of,--good land, well worth the price.  There are only nine days before us for drawing up and recording the  notarial deeds (bear that in mind). With the addition of this land, des  Lupeaulx’s present miserable property would pay taxes to the amount of  one thousand francs, the sum necessary to make a man eligible to the  Chamber. Ergo, with it des Lupeaulx goes into the electoral college,  becomes eligible, count, and whatever he pleases. You know the deputy  who has slipped out and left a vacancy, don’t you?”    The two misers nodded.    “Des Lupeaulx would cut off a leg to get elected in his place,”   continued Mitral; “but he must have the title-deeds of the property in  his own name, and then mortgage them back to us for the amount of the  purchase-money. Ah! now you begin to see what I am after! First of all,  we must make sure of Baudoyer’s appointment, and des Lupeaulx will get  it for us on these terms; after that is settled we will hand him back  to you. Falleix is now canvassing the electoral vote. Don’t you  perceive that you have Lupeaulx completely in your power until after the  election?--for Falleix’s friends are a large majority. Now do you see  what I mean, papa Gigonnet?”    “It’s a clever game,” said Metivier.    “We’ll do it,” said Gigonnet; “you agree, don’t you, Gobseck? Falleix  can give us security and put mortgages on the property in my name; we’ll  go and see des Lupeaulx when all is ready.”    “We’re robbed,” said Gobseck.    “Ha, ha!” laughed Mitral, “I’d like to know the robber!”    “Nobody can rob us but ourselves,” answered Gigonnet. “I told you we  were doing a good thing in buying up all des Lupeaulx’s paper from his  creditors at sixty per cent discount.”    “Take this mortgage on his estate and you’ll hold him tighter still  through the interest,” answered Mitral.    “Possibly,” said Gobseck.    After exchanging a shrewd look with Gobseck, Gigonnet went to the door  of the cafe.    “Elisabeth! follow it up, my dear,” he said to his niece. “We hold your  man securely; but don’t neglect accessories. You have begun well, clever  woman! go on as you began and you’ll have your uncle’s esteem,” and he  grasped her hand, gayly.    “But,” said Mitral, “Metivier and Chaboisseau heard it all, and they  may play us a trick and tell the matter to some opposition journal  which would catch the ball on its way and counteract the effect of the  ministerial article. You must go alone, my dear; I dare not let those  two cormorants out of my sight.” So saying he re-entered the cafe.    The next day the numerous subscribers to a certain liberal journal read,  among the Paris items, the following article, inserted authoritatively  by Chaboisseau and Metivier, share-holders in the said journal, brokers  for publishers, printers, and paper-makers, whose behests no editor  dared refuse:--      “Yesterday a ministerial journal plainly indicated as the probable    successor of Monsieur le Baron de la Billardiere, Monsieur    Baudoyer, one of the worthiest citizens of a populous quarter,    where his benevolence is scarcely less known than the piety on    which the ministerial organ laid so much stress. Why was that    sheet silent as to his talents? Did it reflect that in boasting of    the bourgeoise nobility of Monsieur Baudoyer--which, certainly, is    a nobility as good as any other--it was pointing out a reason for    the exclusion of the candidate? A gratuitous piece of perfidy! an    attempt to kill with a caress! To appoint Monsieur Baudoyer is to    do honor to the virtues, the talents of the middle classes, of    whom we shall ever be the supporters, though their cause seems at    times a lost one. This appointment, we repeat, will be an act of    justice and good policy; consequently we may be sure it will not    be made.”    On the morrow, Friday, the usual day for the dinner given by Madame  Rabourdin, whom des Lupeaulx had left at midnight, radiant in beauty, on  the staircase of the Bouffons, arm in arm with Madame de Camps (Madame  Firmiani had lately married), the old roue awoke with his thoughts  of vengeance calmed, or rather refreshed, and his mind full of a last  glance exchanged with Celestine.    “I’ll make sure of Rabourdin’s support by forgiving him now,--I’ll get  even with him later. If he hasn’t this place for the time being I should  have to give up a woman who is capable of becoming a most precious  instrument in the pursuit of high political fortune. She understands  everything; shrinks from nothing, from no idea whatever!--and besides,  I can’t know before his Excellency what new scheme of administration  Rabourdin has invented. No, my dear des Lupeaulx, the thing in hand is  to win all now for your Celestine. You may make as many faces as you  please, Madame la comtesse, but you will invite Madame Rabourdin to your  next select party.”    Des Lupeaulx was one of those men who to satisfy a passion are quite  able to put away revenge in some dark corner of their minds. His course  was taken; he was resolved to get Rabourdin appointed.    “I will prove to you, my dear fellow, that I deserve a good place in  your galley,” thought he as he seated himself in his study and began to  unfold a newspaper.    He knew so well what the ministerial organ would contain that he rarely  took the trouble to read it, but on this occasion he did open it to  look at the article on La Billardiere, recollecting with amusement the  dilemma in which du Bruel had put him by bringing him the night before  Bixiou’s amendments to the obituary. He was laughing to himself as he  reread the biography of the late Comte da Fontaine, dead a few months  earlier, which he had hastily substituted for that of La Billardiere,  when his eyes were dazzled by the name of Baudoyer. He read with fury  the article which pledged the minister, and then he rang violently for  Dutocq, to send him at once to the editor. But what was his astonishment  on reading the reply of the opposition paper! The situation was  evidently serious. He knew the game, and he saw that the man who was  shuffling his cards for him was a Greek of the first order. To dictate  in this way through two opposing newspapers in one evening, and to begin  the fight by forestalling the intentions of the minister was a daring  game! He recognized the pen of a liberal editor, and resolved to  question him that night at the opera. Dutocq appeared.    “Read that,” said des Lupeaulx, handing him over the two journals, and  continuing to run his eye over others to see if Baudoyer had pulled  any further wires. “Go to the office and ask who has dared to thus  compromise the minister.”    “It was not Monsieur Baudoyer himself,” answered Dutocq, “for he never  left the ministry yesterday. I need not go and inquire; for when I took  your article to the newspaper office I met a young abbe who brought in a  letter from the Grand Almoner, before which you yourself would have had  to bow.”    “Dutocq, you have a grudge against Monsieur Rabourdin, and it isn’t  right; for he has twice saved you from being turned out. However, we  are not masters of our own feelings; we sometimes hate our benefactors.  Only, remember this; if you show the slightest treachery to Rabourdin,  without my permission, it will be your ruin. As to that newspaper,  let the Grand Almoner subscribe as largely as we do, if he wants  its services. Here we are at the end of the year; the matter of  subscriptions will come up for discussion, and I shall have something to  say on that head. As to La Billardiere’s place, there is only one way to  settle the matter; and that is to appoint Rabourdin this very day.”    “Gentlemen,” said Dutocq, returning to the clerks’ office and addressing  his colleagues. “I don’t know if Bixiou has the art of looking into  futurity, but if you have not read the ministerial journal I advise you  to study the article about Baudoyer; then, as Monsieur Fleury takes the  opposition sheet, you can see the reply. Monsieur Rabourdin certainly  has talent, but a man who in these days gives a six-thousand-franc  monstrance to the Church has a devilish deal more talent than he.”    Bixiou [entering]. “What say you, gentlemen, to the First Epistle to the  Corinthians in our pious ministerial journal, and the reply Epistle to  the Ministers in the opposition sheet? How does Monsieur Rabourdin feel  now, du Bruel?”    Du Bruel [rushing in]. “I don’t know.” [He drags Bixiou back into his  cabinet, and says in a low voice] “My good fellow, your way of helping  people is like that of the hangman who jumps upon a victim’s shoulders  to break his neck. You got me into a scrape with des Lupeaulx, which my  folly in ever trusting you richly deserved. A fine thing indeed, that  article on La Billardiere. I sha’n’t forget the trick! Why, the very  first sentence was as good as telling the King he was superannuated and  it was time for him to die. And as to that Quiberon bit, it said plainly  that the King was a--What a fool I was!”    Bixiou [laughing]. “Bless my heart! are you getting angry? Can’t a  fellow joke any more?”    Du Bruel. “Joke! joke indeed. When you want to be made head-clerk  somebody shall joke with you, my dear fellow.”    Bixiou [in a bullying tone]. “Angry, are we?”    Du Bruel. “Yes!”    Bixiou [dryly]. “So much the worse for you.”    Du Bruel [uneasy]. “You wouldn’t pardon such a thing yourself, I know.”    Bixiou [in a wheedling tone]. “To a friend? indeed I would.” [They hear  Fleury’s voice.] “There’s Fleury cursing Baudoyer. Hey, how well  the thing has been managed! Baudoyer will get the appointment.”   [Confidentially] “After all, so much the better. Du Bruel, just keep  your eye on the consequences. Rabourdin would be a mean-spirited  creature to stay under Baudoyer; he will send in his registration, and  that will give us two places. You can be head of the bureau and take me  for under-head-clerk. We will make vaudevilles together, and I’ll fag at  your work in the office.”    Du Bruel [smiling]. “Dear me, I never thought of that. Poor Rabourdin! I  shall be sorry for him, though.”    Bixiou. “That shows how much you love him!” [Changing his tone] “Ah,  well, I don’t pity him any longer. He’s rich; his wife gives parties and  doesn’t ask me,--me, who go everywhere! Well, good-bye, my dear fellow,  good-bye, and don’t owe me a grudge!” [He goes out through the clerks’  office.] “Adieu, gentlemen; didn’t I tell you yesterday that a man who  has nothing but virtues and talents will always be poor, even though he  has a pretty wife?”    Henry. “You are so rich, you!”    Bixiou. “Not bad, my Cincinnatus! But you’ll give me that dinner at the  Rocher de Cancale.”    Poiret. “It is absolutely impossible for me to understand Monsieur  Bixiou.”    Phellion [with an elegaic air]. “Monsieur Rabourdin so seldom reads the  newspapers that it might perhaps be serviceable to deprive ourselves  momentarily by taking them in to him.” [Fleury hands over his paper,  Vimeux the office sheet, and Phellion departs with them.]    At that moment des Lupeaulx, coming leisurely downstairs to breakfast  with the minister, was asking himself whether, before playing a trump  card for the husband, it might not be prudent to probe the wife’s heart  and make sure of a reward for his devotion. He was feeling about for  the small amount of heart that he possessed, when, at a turn of the  staircase, he encountered his lawyer, who said to him, smiling, “Just a  word, Monseigneur,” in the tone of familiarity assumed by men who know  they are indispensable.    “What is it, my dear Desroches?” exclaimed the politician. “Has anything  happened?”    “I have come to tell you that all your notes and debts have been brought  up by Gobseck and Gigonnet, under the name of a certain Samanon.”    “Men whom I helped to make their millions!”    “Listen,” whispered the lawyer. “Gigonnet (really named Bidault) is  the uncle of Saillard, your cashier; and Saillard is father-in-law to a  certain Baudoyer, who thinks he has a right to the vacant place in your  ministry. Don’t you think I have done right to come and tell you?”    “Thank you,” said des Lupeaulx, nodding to the lawyer with a shrewd  look.    “One stroke of your pen will buy them off,” said Desroches, leaving him.    “What an immense sacrifice!” muttered des Lupeaulx. “It would be  impossible to explain it to a woman,” thought he. “Is Celestine worth  more than the clearing off of my debts?--that is the question. I’ll go  and see her this morning.”    So the beautiful Madame Rabourdin was to be, within an hour, the arbiter  of her husband’s fate, and no power on earth could warn her of the  importance of her replies, or give her the least hint to guard her  conduct and compose her voice. Moreover, in addition to her mischances,  she believed herself certain of success, never dreaming that Rabourdin  was undermined in all directions by the secret sapping of the mollusks.    “Well, Monseigneur,” said des Lupeaulx, entering the little salon where  they breakfasted, “have you seen the articles on Baudoyer?”    “For God’s sake, my dear friend,” replied the minister, “don’t talk of  those appointments just now; let me have an hour’s peace! They cracked  my ears last night with that monstrance. The only way to save Rabourdin  is to bring his appointment before the Council, unless I submit to  having my hand forced. It is enough to disgust a man with the public  service. I must purchase the right to keep that excellent Rabourdin by  promoting a certain Colleville!”    “Why not make over the management of this pretty little comedy to me,  and rid yourself of the worry of it? I’ll amuse you every morning with  an account of the game of chess I should play with the Grand Almoner,”   said des Lupeaulx.    “Very good,” said the minister, “settle it with the head examiner. But  you know perfectly well that nothing is more likely to strike the king’s  mind than just those reasons the opposition journal has chosen to put  forth. Good heavens! fancy managing a ministry with such men as Baudoyer  under me!”    “An imbecile bigot,” said des Lupeaulx, “and as utterly incapable as--”    “--as La Billardiere,” added the minister.    “But La Billardiere had the manners of a gentleman-in-ordinary,” replied  des Lupeaulx. “Madame,” he continued, addressing the countess, “it  is now an absolute necessity to invite Madame Rabourdin to your next  private party. I must assure you she is the intimate friend of Madame  de Camps; they were at the Opera together last night. I first met her at  the hotel Firmiani. Besides, you will see that she is not of a kind to  compromise a salon.”    “Invite Madame Rabourdin, my dear,” said the minister, “and pray let us  talk of something else.”          CHAPTER VII. SCENES FROM DOMESTIC LIFE      Parisian households are literally eaten up with the desire to be in  keeping with the luxury that surrounds them on all sides, and few there  are who have the wisdom to let their external situation conform to  their internal revenue. But this vice may perhaps denote a truly French  patriotism, which seeks to maintain the supremacy of the nation in the  matter of dress. France reigns through clothes over the whole of Europe;  and every one must feel the importance of retaining a commercial sceptre  that makes fashion in France what the navy is to England. This patriotic  ardor which leads a nation to sacrifice everything to appearances--to  the “paroistre,” as d’Aubigne said in the days of Henri IV.--is the  cause of those vast secret labors which employ the whole of a Parisian  woman’s morning, when she wishes, as Madame Rabourdin wished, to keep  up on twelve thousand francs a year the style that many a family with  thirty thousand does not indulge in. Consequently, every Friday,--the  day of her dinner parties,--Madame Rabourdin helped the chambermaid to  do the rooms; for the cook went early to market, and the man-servant was  cleaning the silver, folding the napkins, and polishing the glasses.  The ill-advised individual who might happen, through an oversight of the  porter, to enter Madame Rabourdin’s establishment about eleven o’clock  in the morning would have found her in the midst of a disorder  the reverse of picturesque, wrapped in a dressing-gown, her hair  ill-dressed, and her feet in old slippers, attending to the lamps,  arranging the flowers, or cooking in haste an extremely unpoetic  breakfast. The visitor to whom the mysteries of Parisian life were  unknown would certainly have learned for the rest of his life not to  set foot in these greenrooms at the wrong moment; a woman caught in her  matin mysteries would ever after point him out as a man capable of the  blackest crimes; or she would talk of his stupidity and indiscretion  in a manner to ruin him. The true Parisian woman, indulgent to all  curiosity that she can put to profit, is implacable to that which makes  her lose her prestige. Such a domiciliary invasion may be called,  not only (as they say in police reports) an attack on privacy, but a  burglary, a robbery of all that is most precious, namely, CREDIT. A  woman is quite willing to let herself be surprised half-dressed, with  her hair about her shoulders. If her hair is all her own she scores one;  but she will never allow herself to be seen “doing” her own rooms, or  she loses her pariostre,--that precious /seeming-to-be/!    Madame Rabourdin was in full tide of preparation for her Friday dinner,  standing in the midst of provisions the cook had just fished from the  vast ocean of the markets, when Monsieur des Lupeaulx made his way  stealthily in. The general-secretary was certainly the last man Madame  Rabourdin expected to see, and so, when she heard his boots creaking  in the ante-chamber, she exclaimed, impatiently, “The hair-dresser  already!”--an exclamation as little agreeable to des Lupeaulx as the  sight of des Lupeaulx was agreeable to her. She immediately escaped into  her bedroom, where chaos reigned; a jumble of furniture to be put out  of sight, with other heterogeneous articles of more or rather less  elegance,--a domestic carnival, in short. The bold des Lupeaulx followed  the handsome figure, so piquant did she seem to him in her dishabille.  There is something indescribably alluring to the eye in a portion of  flesh seen through an hiatus in the undergarment, more attractive far  than when it rises gracefully above the circular curve of the velvet  bodice, to the vanishing line of the prettiest swan’s-neck that ever  lover kissed before a ball. When the eye dwells on a woman in full dress  making exhibition of her magnificent white shoulders, do we not fancy  that we see the elegant dessert of a grand dinner? But the glance that  glides through the disarray of muslins rumpled in sleep enjoys, as it  were, a feast of stolen fruit glowing between the leaves on a garden  wall.    “Stop! wait!” cried the pretty Parisian, bolting the door of the  disordered room.    She rang for Therese, called for her daughter, the cook, and the  man-servant, wishing she possessed the whistle of the machinist at  the Opera. Her call, however, answered the same purpose. In a moment,  another phenomenon! the salon assumed a piquant morning look, quite in  keeping with the becoming toilet hastily got together by the fugitive;  we say it to her glory, for she was evidently a clever woman, in this at  least.    “You!” she said, coming forward, “at this hour? What has happened?”    “Very serious things,” answered des Lupeaulx. “You and I must understand  each other now.”    Celestine looked at the man behind his glasses, and understood the  matter.    “My principle vice,” she said, “is oddity. For instance, I do not mix  up affections with politics; let us talk politics,--business, if you  will,--the rest can come later. However, it is not really oddity nor  a whim that forbids me to mingle ill-assorted colors and put together  things that have no affinity, and compels me to avoid discords; it is my  natural instinct as an artist. We women have politics of our own.”    Already the tones of her voice and the charm of her manners were  producing their effect on the secretary and metamorphosing his roughness  into sentimental courtesy; she had recalled him to his obligations as a  lover. A clever pretty woman makes an atmosphere about her in which the  nerves relax and the feelings soften.    “You are ignorant of what is happening,” said des Lupeaulx, harshly, for  he still thought it best to make a show of harshness. “Read that.”    He gave the two newspapers to the graceful woman, having drawn a line in  red ink round each of the famous articles.    “Good heavens!” she exclaimed, “but this is dreadful! Who is this  Baudoyer?”    “A donkey,” answered des Lupeaulx; “but, as you see, he uses means,--he  gives monstrances; he succeeds, thanks to some clever hand that pulls  the wires.”    The thought of her debts crossed Madame Rabourdin’s mind and blurred  her sight, as if two lightning flashes had blinded her eyes at the same  moment; her ears hummed under the pressure of the blood that began to  beat in her arteries; she remained for a moment quite bewildered, gazing  at a window which she did not see.    “But are you faithful to us?” she said at last, with a winning glance at  des Lupeaulx, as if to attach him to her.    “That is as it may be,” he replied, answering her glance with an  interrogative look which made the poor woman blush.    “If you demand caution-money you may lose all,” she said, laughing; “I  thought you more magnanimous than you are. And you, you thought me less  a person than I am,--a sort of school-girl.”    “You have misunderstood me,” he said, with a covert smile; “I meant that  I could not assist a man who plays against me just as l’Etourdi played  against Mascarille.”    “What can you mean?”    “This will prove to you whether I am magnanimous or not.”    He gave Madame Rabourdin the memorandum stolen by Dutocq, pointing out  to her the passage in which her husband had so ably analyzed him.    “Read that.”    Celestine recognized the handwriting, read the paper, and turned pale  under the blow.    “All the ministries, the whole service is treated in the same way,” said  des Lupeaulx.    “Happily,” she said, “you alone possess this document. I cannot explain  it, even to myself.”    “The man who stole it is not such a fool as to let me have it without  keeping a copy for himself; he is too great a liar to admit it, and too  clever in his business to give it up. I did not even ask him for it.”    “Who is he?”    “Your chief clerk.”    “Dutocq! People are always punished through their kindnesses! But,” she  added, “he is only a dog who wants a bone.”    “Do you know what the other side offer me, poor devil of a  general-secretary?”    “What?”    “I owe thirty-thousand and odd miserable francs,--you will despise me  because it isn’t more, but here, I grant you, I am significant. Well,  Baudoyer’s uncle has bought up my debts, and is, doubtless, ready to  give me a receipt for them if Baudoyer is appointed.”    “But all that is monstrous.”    “Not at all; it is monarchical and religious, for the Grand Almoner is  concerned in it. Baudoyer himself must appoint Colleville in return for  ecclesiastical assistance.”    “What shall you do?”    “What will you bid me do?” he said, with charming grace, holding out his  hand.    Celestine no longer thought him ugly, nor old, nor white and chilling as  a hoar-frost, nor indeed anything that was odious and offensive, but she  did not give him her hand. At night, in her salon, she would have let  him take it a hundred times, but here, alone and in the morning, the  action seemed too like a promise that might lead her far.    “And they say that statesmen have no hearts!” she cried  enthusiastically, trying to hide the harshness of her refusal under  the grace of her words. “The thought used to terrify me,” she added,  assuming an innocent, ingenuous air.    “What a calumny!” cried des Lupeaulx. “Only this week one of the  stiffest of diplomatists, a man who has been in the service ever since  he came to manhood, has married the daughter of an actress, and has  introduced her at the most iron-bound court in Europe as to quarterings  of nobility.”    “You will continue to support us?”    “I am to draw up your husband’s appointment--But no cheating, remember.”    She gave him her hand to kiss, and tapped him on the cheek as she did  so. “You are mine!” she said.    Des Lupeaulx admired the expression.    [That night, at the Opera, the old coxcomb related the incident as  follows: “A woman who did not want to tell a man she would be his,--an  acknowledgment a well-bred woman never allows herself to make,--changed  the words into ‘You are mine.’ Don’t you think the evasion charming?”]    “But you must be my ally,” he answered. “Now listen, your husband has  spoken to the minister of a plan for the reform of the administration;  the paper I have shown you is a part of that plan. I want to know what  it is. Find out, and tell me to-night.”    “I will,” she answered, wholly unaware of the important nature of the  errand which brought des Lupeaulx to the house that morning.    “Madame, the hair-dresser.”    “At last!” thought Celestine. “I don’t see how I should have got out of  it if he had delayed much longer.”    “You do not know to what lengths my devotion can go,” said des Lupeaulx,  rising. “You shall be invited to the first select party given by his  Excellency’s wife.”    “Ah, you are an angel!” she cried. “And I see now how much you love me;  you love me intelligently.”    “To-night, dear child,” he said, “I shall find out at the Opera what  journalists are conspiring for Baudoyer, and we will measure swords  together.”    “Yes, but you must dine with us, will you not? I have taken pains to get  the things you like best--”    “All that is so like love,” said des Lupeaulx to himself as he went  downstairs, “that I am willing to be deceived in that way for a  long time. Well, if she IS tricking me I shall know it. I’ll set the  cleverest of all traps before the appointment is fairly signed, and I’ll  read her heart. Ah! my little cats, I know you! for, after all, women  are just what we men are. Twenty-eight years old, virtuous, and living  here in the rue Duphot!--a rare piece of luck and worth cultivating,”   thought the elderly butterfly as he fluttered down the staircase.    “Good heavens! that man, without his glasses, must look funny enough in  a dressing-gown!” thought Celestine, “but the harpoon is in his back and  he’ll tow me where I want to go; I am sure now of that invitation. He  has played his part in my comedy.”    When, at five o’clock in the afternoon, Rabourdin came home to dress for  dinner, his wife presided at his toilet and presently laid before him  the fatal memorandum which, like the slipper in the Arabian Nights, the  luckless man was fated to meet at every turn.    “Who gave you that?” he asked, thunderstruck.    “Monsieur des Lupeaulx.”    “So he has been here!” cried Rabourdin, with a look which would  certainly have made a guilty woman turn pale, but which Celestine  received with unruffled brow and a laughing eye.    “And he is coming back to dinner,” she said. “Why that startled air?”    “My dear,” replied Rabourdin, “I have mortally offended des Lupeaulx;  such men never forgive, and yet he fawns upon me! Do you think I don’t  see why?”    “The man seems to me,” she said, “to have good taste; you can’t expect  me to blame him. I really don’t know anything more flattering to a woman  than to please a worn-out palate. After--”    “A truce to nonsense, Celestine. Spare a much-tried man. I cannot get an  audience of the minister, and my honor is at stake.”    “Good heavens, no! Dutocq can have the promise of a good place as soon  as you are named head of the division.”    “Ah! I see what you are about, dear child,” said Rabourdin; “but the  game you are playing is just as dishonorable as the real thing that is  going on around us. A lie is a lie, and an honest woman--”    “Let me use the weapons employed against us.”    “Celestine, the more that man des Lupeaulx feels he is foolishly caught  in a trap, the more bitter he will be against me.”    “What if I get him dismissed altogether?”    Rabourdin looked at his wife in amazement.    “I am thinking only of your advancement; it was high time, my poor  husband,” continued Celestine. “But you are mistaking the dog for the  game,” she added, after a pause. “In a few days des Lupeaulx will have  accomplished all that I want of him. While you are trying to speak to  the minister, and before you can even see him on business, I shall have  seen him and spoken with him. You are worn out in trying to bring that  plan of your brain to birth,--a plan which you have been hiding from me;  but you will find that in three months your wife has accomplished more  than you have done in six years. Come, tell me this fine scheme of  yours.”    Rabourdin, continuing to shave, cautioned his wife not to say a word  about his work, and after assuring her that to confide a single idea  to des Lupeaulx would be to put the cat near the milk-jug, he began an  explanation of his labors.    “Why didn’t you tell me this before, Rabourdin?” said Celestine, cutting  her husband short at his fifth sentence. “You might have saved yourself  a world of trouble. I can understand that a man should be blinded by an  idea for a moment, but to nurse it up for six or seven years, that’s a  thing I cannot comprehend! You want to reduce the budget,--a vulgar  and commonplace idea! The budget ought, on the contrary, to reach two  hundred millions. Then, indeed, France would be great. If you want a new  system let it be one of loans, as Monsieur de Nucingen keeps saying. The  poorest of all treasuries is the one with a surplus that it never  uses; the mission of a minister of finance is to fling gold out of the  windows. It will come back to him through the cellars; and you, you  want to hoard it! The thing to do is to increase the offices and all  government employments, instead of reducing them! So far from lessening  the public debt, you ought to increase the creditors. If the Bourbons  want to reign in peace, let them seek creditors in the towns and  villages, and place their loans there; above all, they ought not to  let foreigners draw interest away from France; some day an alien nation  might ask us for the capital. Whereas if capital and interest are held  only in France, neither France nor credit can perish. That’s what saved  England. Your plan is the tradesman’s plan. An ambitious public man  should produce some bold scheme,--he should make himself another Law,  without Law’s fatal ill-luck; he ought to exhibit the power of credit,  and show that we should reduce, not principal, but interest, as they do  in England.”    “Come, come, Celestine,” said Rabourdin; “mix up ideas as much as  you please, and make fun of them,--I’m accustomed to that; but don’t  criticise a work of which you know nothing as yet.”    “Do I need,” she asked, “to know a scheme the essence of which is to  govern France with a civil service of six thousand men instead of twenty  thousand? My dear friend, even allowing it were the plan of a man of  genius, a king of France who attempted to carry it out would get himself  dethroned. You can keep down a feudal aristocracy by levelling a few  heads, but you can’t subdue a hydra with thousands. And is it with the  present ministers--between ourselves, a wretched crew--that you expect  to carry out your reform? No, no; change the monetary system if you  will, but do not meddle with men, with little men; they cry out too  much, whereas gold is dumb.”    “But, Celestine, if you will talk, and put wit before argument, we shall  never understand each other.”    “Understand! I understand what that paper, in which you have analyzed  the capacities of the men in office, will lead to,” she replied, paying  no attention to what her husband said. “Good heavens! you have sharpened  the axe to cut off your own head. Holy Virgin! why didn’t you consult  me? I could have at least prevented you from committing anything to  writing, or, at any rate, if you insisted on putting it to paper, I  would have written it down myself, and it should never have left this  house. Good God! to think that he never told me! That’s what men are!  capable of sleeping with the wife of their bosom for seven years, and  keeping a secret from her! Hiding their thoughts from a poor woman for  seven years!--doubting her devotion!”    “But,” cried Rabourdin, provoked, “for eleven years and more I have been  unable to discuss anything with you because you insist on cutting me  short and substituting your ideas for mine. You know nothing at all  about my scheme.”    “Nothing! I know all.”    “Then tell it to me!” cried Rabourdin, angry for the first time since  his marriage.    “There! it is half-past six o’clock; finish shaving and dress at once,”   she cried hastily, after the fashion of women when pressed on a point  they are not ready to talk of. “I must go; we’ll adjourn the discussion,  for I don’t want to be nervous on a reception-day. Good heavens! the  poor soul!” she thought, as she left the room, “it /is/ hard to be in  labor for seven years and bring forth a dead child! And not trust his  wife!”    She went back into the room.    “If you had listened to me you would never had interceded to keep your  chief clerk; he stole that abominable paper, and has, no doubt, kept a  fac-simile of it. Adieu, man of genius!”    Then she noticed the almost tragic expression of her husband’s grief;  she felt she had gone too far, and ran to him, seized him just as he  was, all lathered with soap-suds, and kissed him tenderly.    “Dear Xavier, don’t be vexed,” she said. “To-night, after the people  are gone, we will study your plan; you shall speak at your ease,--I will  listen just as long as you wish me to. Isn’t that nice of me? What do I  want better than to be the wife of Mohammed?”    She began to laugh; and Rabourdin laughed too, for the soapsuds were  clinging to Celestine’s lips, and her voice had the tones of the purest  and most steadfast affection.    “Go and dress, dear child; and above all, don’t say a word of this to  des Lupeaulx. Swear you will not. That is the only punishment that I  impose--”    “/Impose/!” she cried. “Then I won’t swear anything.”    “Come, come, Celestine, I said in jest a really serious thing.”    “To-night,” she said, “I mean your general-secretary to know whom I am  really intending to attack; he has given me the means.”    “Attack whom?”    “The minister,” she answered, drawing himself up. “We are to be invited  to his wife’s private parties.”    In spite of his Celestine’s loving caresses, Rabourdin, as he finished  dressing, could not prevent certain painful thoughts from clouding his  brow.    “Will she ever appreciate me?” he said to himself. “She does not  even understand that she is the sole incentive of my whole work. How  wrong-headed, and yet how excellent a mind!--If I had not married I  might now have been high in office and rich. I could have saved half my  salary; my savings well-invested would have given me to-day ten thousand  francs a year outside of my office, and I might then have become,  through a good marriage--Yes, that is all true,” he exclaimed,  interrupting himself, “but I have Celestine and my two children.” The  man flung himself back on his happiness. To the best of married lives  there come moments of regret. He entered the salon and looked around  him. “There are not two women in Paris who understand making life  pleasant as she does. To keep such a home as this on twelve thousand  francs a year!” he thought, looking at the flower-stands bright with  bloom, and thinking of the social enjoyments that were about to gratify  his vanity. “She was made to be the wife of a minister. When I think of  his Excellency’s wife, and how little she helps him! the good woman is a  comfortable middle-class dowdy, and when she goes to the palace or into  society--” He pinched his lips together. Very busy men are apt to have  very ignorant notions about household matters, and you can make them  believe that a hundred thousand francs afford little or that twelve  thousand afford all.    Though impatiently expected, and in spite of the flattering dishes  prepared for the palate of the gourmet-emeritus, des Lupeaulx did not  come to dinner; in fact he came in very late, about midnight, an  hour when company dwindles and conversations become intimate and  confidential. Andoche Finot, the journalist, was one of the few  remaining guests.    “I now know all,” said des Lupeaulx, when he was comfortably seated on a  sofa at the corner of the fireplace, a cup of tea in his hand and Madame  Rabourdin standing before him with a plate of sandwiches and some slices  of cake very appropriately called “leaden cake.” “Finot, my dear and  witty friend, you can render a great service to our gracious queen  by letting loose a few dogs upon the men we were talking of. You have  against you,” he said to Rabourdin, lowering his voice so as to be  heard only by the three persons whom he addressed, “a set of usurers and  priests--money and the church. The article in the liberal journal  was instituted by an old money-lender to whom the paper was under  obligations; but the young fellow who wrote it cares nothing about it.  The paper is about to change hands, and in three days more will be on  our side. The royalist opposition,--for we have, thanks to Monsieur de  Chateaubriand, a royalist opposition, that is to say, royalists who  have gone over to the liberals,--however, there’s no need to discuss  political matters now,--these assassins of Charles X. have promised me  to support your appointment at the price of our acquiescence in one of  their amendments. All my batteries are manned. If they threaten us with  Baudoyer we shall say to the clerical phalanx, ‘Such and such a paper  and such and such men will attack your measures and the whole press will  be against you’ (for even the ministerial journals which I influence  will be deaf and dumb, won’t they, Finot?). ‘Appoint Rabourdin, a  faithful servant, and public opinion is with you--’”    “Hi, hi!” laughed Finot.    “So, there’s no need to be uneasy,” said des Lupeaulx. “I have arranged  it all to-night; the Grand Almoner must yield.”    “I would rather have had less hope, and you to dinner,” whispered  Celestine, looking at him with a vexed air which might very well pass  for an expression of wounded love.    “This must win my pardon,” he returned, giving her an invitation to the  ministry for the following Tuesday.    Celestine opened the letter, and a flush of pleasure came into her face.  No enjoyment can be compared to that of gratified vanity.    “You know what the countess’s Tuesdays are,” said des Lupeaulx, with a  confidential air. “To the usual ministerial parties they are what the  ‘Petit-Chateau’ is to a court ball. You will be at the heart of  power! You will see there the Comtesse Feraud, who is still in favor  notwithstanding Louis XVIII.’s death, Delphine de Nucingen, Madame de  Listomere, the Marquise d’Espard, and your dear Firmiani; I have had  her invited to give you her support in case the other women attempt to  black-ball you. I long to see you in the midst of them.”    Celestine threw up her head like a thoroughbred before the race, and  re-read the invitation just as Baudoyer and Saillard had re-read the  articles about themselves in the newspapers, without being able to quaff  enough of it.    “/There/ first, and /next/ at the Tuileries,” she said to des Lupeaulx,  who was startled by the words and by the attitude of the speaker, so  expressive were they of ambition and security.    “Can it be that I am only a stepping-stone?” he asked himself. He  rose, and went into Madame Rabourdin’s bedroom, where she followed him,  understanding from a motion of his head that he wished to speak to her  privately.    “Well, your husband’s plan,” he said; “what of it?”    “Bah! the useless nonsense of an honest man!” she replied. “He wants  to suppress fifteen thousand offices and do the work with five or six  thousand. You never heard of such nonsense; I will let you read the  whole document when copied; it is written in perfect good faith.  His analysis of the officials was prompted only by his honesty and  rectitude,--poor dear man!”    Des Lupeaulx was all the more reassured by the genuine laugh which  accompanied these jesting and contemptuous words, because he was a judge  of lying and knew that Celestine spoke in good faith.    “But still, what is at the bottom of it all?” he asked.    “Well, he wants to do away with the land-tax and substitute taxes on  consumption.”    “Why it is over a year since Francois Keller and Nucingen proposed some  such plan, and the minister himself is thinking of a reduction of the  land-tax.”    “There!” exclaimed Celestine, “I told him there was nothing new in his  scheme.”    “No; but he is on the same ground with the best financier of the  epoch,--the Napoleon of finance. Something may come of it. Your husband  must surely have some special ideas in his method of putting the scheme  into practice.”    “No, it is all commonplace,” she said, with a disdainful curl of her  lip. “Just think of governing France with five or six thousand offices,  when what is really needed is that everybody in France should be  personally enlisted in the support of the government.”    Des Lupeaulx seemed satisfied that Rabourdin, to whom in his own mind he  had granted remarkable talents, was really a man of mediocrity.    “Are you quite sure of the appointment? You don’t want a bit of feminine  advice?” she said.    “You women are greater adepts than we in refined treachery,” he said,  nodding.    “Well, then, say /Baudoyer/ to the court and clergy, to divert suspicion  and put them to sleep, and then, at the last moment, write /Rabourdin/.”    “There are some women who say /yes/ as long as they need a man, and /no/  when he has played his part,” returned des Lupeaulx, significantly.    “I know they do,” she answered, laughing; “but they are very foolish,  for in politics everything recommences. Such proceedings may do with  fools, but you are a man of sense. In my opinion the greatest folly any  one can commit is to quarrel with a clever man.”    “You are mistaken,” said des Lupeaulx, “for such a man pardons. The real  danger is with the petty spiteful natures who have nothing to do but  study revenge,--I spend my life among them.”    When all the guests were gone, Rabourdin came into his wife’s room, and  after asking for her strict attention, he explained his plan and  made her see that it did not cut down the revenue but on the contrary  increased it; he showed her in what ways the public funds were employed,  and how the State could increase tenfold the circulation of money by  putting its own, in the proportion of a third, or a quarter, into the  expenditures which would be sustained by private or local interests. He  finally proved to her plainly that his plan was not mere theory, but  a system teeming with methods of execution. Celestine, brightly  enthusiastic, sprang into her husband’s arms and sat upon his knee in  the chimney-corner.    “At last I find the husband of my dreams!” she cried. “My ignorance of  your real merit has saved you from des Lupeaulx’s claws. I calumniated  you to him gloriously and in good faith.”    The man wept with joy. His day of triumph had come at last. Having  labored for many years to satisfy his wife, he found himself a great man  in the eyes of his sole public.    “To one who knows how good you are, how tender, how equable in anger,  how loving, you are tenfold greater still. But,” she added, “a man of  genius is always more or less a child; and you are a child, a dearly  beloved child,” she said, caressing him. Then she drew that invitation  from that particular spot where women put what they sacredly hide, and  showed it to him.    “Here is what I wanted,” she said; “Des Lupeaulx has put me face to face  with the minister, and were he a man of iron, his Excellency shall be  made for a time to bend the knee to me.”    The next day Celestine began her preparations for entrance into the  inner circle of the ministry. It was her day of triumph, her own! Never  courtesan took such pains with herself as this honest woman bestowed  upon her person. No dressmaker was ever so tormented as hers. Madame  Rabourdin forgot nothing. She went herself to the stable where she hired  carriages, and chose a coupe that was neither old, nor bourgeois, nor  showy. Her footman, like the footmen of great houses, had the dress  and appearance of a master. About ten on the evening of the eventful  Tuesday, she left home in a charming full mourning attire. Her hair was  dressed with jet grapes of exquisite workmanship,--an ornament costing  three thousand francs, made by Fossin for an Englishwoman who had left  Paris before it was finished. The leaves were of stamped iron-work, as  light as the vine-leaves themselves, and the artist had not forgotten  the graceful tendrils, which twined in the wearer’s curls just as,  in nature, they catch upon the branches. The bracelets, necklace, and  earrings were all what is called Berlin iron-work; but these delicate  arabesques were made in Vienna, and seemed to have been fashioned by the  fairies who, the stories tell us, are condemned by a jealous Carabosse  to collect the eyes of ants, or weave a fabric so diaphanous that a  nutshell can contain it. Madame Rabourdin’s graceful figure, made  more slender still by the black draperies, was shown to advantage by a  carefully cut dress, the two sides of which met at the shoulders in  a single strap without sleeves. At every motion she seemed, like a  butterfly, to be about to leave her covering; but the gown held firmly  on by some contrivance of the wonderful dressmaker. The robe was of  mousseline de laine--a material which the manufacturers had not yet sent  to the Paris markets; a delightful stuff which some months later was to  have a wild success, a success which went further and lasted longer than  most French fashions. The actual economy of mousseline de laine, which  needs no washing, has since injured the sale of cotton fabrics enough to  revolutionize the Rouen manufactories. Celestine’s little feet, covered  with fine silk stockings and turk-satin shoes (for silk-satin is  inadmissible in deep mourning) were of elegant proportions. Thus  dressed, she was very handsome. Her complexion, beautified by a  bran-bath, was softly radiant. Her eyes, suffused with the light of  hope, and sparkling with intelligence, justified her claims to the  superiority which des Lupeaulx, proud and happy on this occasion,  asserted for her.    She entered the room well (women will understand the meaning of that  expression), bowed gracefully to the minister’s wife, with a happy  mixture of deference and of self-respect, and gave no offence by a  certain reliance on her own dignity; for every beautiful woman has the  right to seem a queen. With the minister himself she took the pretty air  of sauciness which women may properly allow themselves with men, even  when they are grand dukes. She reconnoitred the field, as it were,  while taking her seat, and saw that she was in the midst of one of those  select parties of few persons, where the women eye and appraise each  other, and every word said echoes in all ears; where every glance is  a stab, and conversation a duel with witnesses; where all that is  commonplace seems commoner still, and where every form of merit or  distinction is silently accepted as though it were the natural level of  all present. Rabourdin betook himself to the adjoining salon in which  a few persons were playing cards; and there he planted himself on  exhibition, as it were, which proved that he was not without social  intelligence.    “My dear,” said the Marquise d’Espard to the Comtesse Feraud, Louis  XVIII.’s last mistress, “Paris is certainly unique. It produces--whence  and how, who knows?--women like this person, who seems ready to will and  to do anything.”    “She really does will, and does do everything,” put in des Lupeaulx,  puffed up with satisfaction.    At this moment the wily Madame Rabourdin was courting the minister’s  wife. Carefully coached the evening before by des Lupeaulx, who knew all  the countess’s weak spots, she was flattering her without seeming to do  so. Every now and then she kept silence; for des Lupeaulx, in love as he  was, knew her defects, and said to her the night before, “Be careful  not to talk too much,”--words which were really an immense proof of  attachment. Bertrand Barrere left behind him this sublime axiom: “Never  interrupt a woman when dancing to give her advice,” to which we may add  (to make this chapter of the female code complete), “Never blame a woman  for scattering her pearls.”    The conversation became general. From time to time Madame Rabourdin  joined in, just as a well-trained cat puts a velvet paw on her  mistress’s laces with the claws carefully drawn in. The minister, in  matters of the heart, had few emotions. There was not another statesman  under the Restoration who had so completely done with gallantry as he;  even the opposition papers, the “Miroir,” “Pandora,” and “Figaro,” could  not find a single throbbing artery with which to reproach him. Madame  Rabourdin knew this, but she knew also that ghosts return to old  castles, and she had taken it into her head to make the minister jealous  of the happiness which des Lupeaulx was appearing to enjoy. The latter’s  throat literally gurgled with the name of his divinity. To launch his  supposed mistress successfully, he was endeavoring to persuade the  Marquise d’Espard, Madame de Nucingen, and the countess, in an eight-ear  conversation, that they had better admit Madame Rabourdin to their  coalition; and Madame de Camps was supporting him. At the end of the  hour the minister’s vanity was greatly tickled; Madame Rabourdin’s  cleverness pleased him, and she had won his wife, who, delighted with  the siren, invited her to come to all her receptions whenever she  pleased.    “For your husband, my dear,” she said, “will soon be director; the  minister intends to unite the two divisions and place them under one  director; you will then be one of us, you know.”    His Excellency carried off Madame Rabourdin on his arm to show her a  certain room, which was then quite celebrated because the opposition  journals blamed him for decorating it extravagantly; and together they  laughed over the absurdities of journalism.    “Madame, you really must give the countess and myself the pleasure of  seeing you here often.”    And he went on with a round of ministerial compliments.    “But, Monseigneur,” she replied, with one of those glances which women  hold in reserve, “it seems to me that that depends on you.”    “How so?”    “You alone can give me the right to come here.”    “Pray explain.”    “No; I said to myself before I came that I would certainly not have the  bad taste to seem a petitioner.”    “No, no, speak freely. Places asked in this way are never out of place,”   said the minister, laughing; for there is no jest too silly to amuse a  solemn man.    “Well, then, I must tell you plainly that the wife of the head of a  bureau is out of place here; a director’s wife is not.”    “That point need not be considered,” said the minister, “your husband is  indispensable to the administration; he is already appointed.”    “Is that a veritable fact?”    “Would you like to see the papers in my study? They are already drawn  up.”    “Then,” she said, pausing in a corner where she was alone with the  minister, whose eager attentions were now very marked, “let me tell you  that I can make you a return.”    She was on the point of revealing her husband’s plan, when des Lupeaulx,  who had glided noiselessly up to them, uttered an angry sound, which  meant that he did not wish to appear to have overheard what, in fact, he  had been listening to. The minister gave an ill-tempered look at the  old beau, who, impatient to win his reward, had hurried, beyond all  precedent, the preliminary work of the appointment. He had carried the  papers to his Excellency that evening, and desired to take himself,  on the morrow, the news of the appointment to her whom he was now  endeavoring to exhibit as his mistress. Just then the minister’s valet  approached des Lupeaulx in a mysterious manner, and told him that his  own servant wished him to deliver to him at once a letter of the utmost  importance.    The general-secretary went up to a lamp and read a note thus worded:--         Contrary to my custom, I am waiting in your ante-chamber to see     you; you have not a moment to lose if you wish to come to terms     with    Your obedient servant, Gobseck.      The secretary shuddered when he saw the signature, which we regret we  cannot give in fac-simile, for it would be valuable to those who like to  guess character from what may be called the physiognomy of signature.  If ever a hieroglyphic sign expressed an animal, it was assuredly this  written name, in which the first and the final letter approached each  other like the voracious jaws of a shark,--insatiable, always open,  seeking whom to devour, both strong and weak. As for the wording of  the note, the spirit of usury alone could have inspired a sentence so  imperative, so insolently curt and cruel, which said all and revealed  nothing. Those who had never heard of Gobseck would have felt, on  reading words which compelled him to whom they were addressed to obey,  yet gave no order, the presence of the implacable money-lender of the  rue des Gres. Like a dog called to heel by the huntsman, des Lupeaulx  left his present quest and went immediately to his own rooms, thinking  of his hazardous position. Imagine a general to whom an aide-de-camp  rides up and says: “The enemy with thirty thousand fresh troops is  attacking on our right flank.”    A very few words will serve to explain this sudden arrival of Gigonnet  and Gobseck on the field of battle,--for des Lupeaulx found them both  waiting. At eight o’clock that evening, Martin Falleix, returning on the  wings of the wind,--thanks to three francs to the postboys and a courier  in advance,--had brought back with him the deeds of the property signed  the night before. Taken at once to the Cafe Themis by Mitral, these  securities passed into the hands of the two usurers, who hastened  (though on foot) to the ministry. It was past eleven o’clock. Des  Lupeaulx trembled when he saw those sinister faces, emitting a  simultaneous look as direct as a pistol shot and as brilliant as the  flash itself.    “What is it, my masters?” he said.    The two extortioners continued cold and motionless. Gigonnet silently  pointed to the documents in his hand, and then at the servant.    “Come into my study,” said des Lupeaulx, dismissing his valet by a sign.    “You understand French very well,” remarked Gigonnet, approvingly.    “Have you come here to torment a man who enabled each of you to make a  couple of hundred thousand francs?”    “And who will help us to make more, I hope,” said Gigonnet.    “Some new affair?” asked des Lupeaulx. “If you want me to help you,  consider that I recollect the past.”    “So do we,” answered Gigonnet.    “My debts must be paid,” said des Lupeaulx, disdainfully, so as not to  seem worsted at the outset.    “True,” said Gobseck.    “Let us come to the point, my son,” said Gigonnet. “Don’t stiffen your  chin in your cravat; with us all that is useless. Take these deeds and  read them.”    The two usurers took a mental inventory of des Lupeaulx’s study while  he read with amazement and stupefaction a deed of purchase which seemed  wafted to him from the clouds by angels.    “Don’t you think you have a pair of intelligent business agents in  Gobseck and me?” asked Gigonnet.    “But tell me, to what do I owe such able co-operation?” said des  Lupeaulx, suspicious and uneasy.    “We knew eight days ago a fact that without us you would not have known  till to-morrow morning. The president of the chamber of commerce, a  deputy, as you know, feels himself obliged to resign.”    Des Lupeaulx’s eyes dilated, and were as big as daisies.    “Your minister has been tricking you about this event,” said the concise  Gobseck.    “You master me,” said the general-secretary, bowing with an air of  profound respect, bordering however, on sarcasm.    “True,” said Gobseck.    “Can you mean to strangle me?”    “Possibly.”    “Well, then, begin your work, executioners,” said the secretary,  smiling.    “You will see,” resumed Gigonnet, “that the sum total of your debts is  added to the sum loaned by us for the purchase of the property; we have  bought them up.”    “Here are the deeds,” said Gobseck, taking from the pocket of his  greenish overcoat a number of legal papers.    “You have three years in which to pay off the whole sum,” said Gigonnet.    “But,” said des Lupeaulx, frightened at such kindness, and also by so  apparently fantastic an arrangement. “What do you want of me?”    “La Billardiere’s place for Baudoyer,” said Gigonnet, quickly.    “That’s a small matter, though it will be next to impossible for me to  do it,” said des Lupeaulx. “I have just tied my hands.”    “Bite the cords with your teeth,” said Gigonnet.    “They are sharp,” added Gobseck.    “Is that all?” asked des Lupeaulx.    “We keep the title-deeds of the property till the debts are paid,” said  Gigonnet, putting one of the papers before des Lupeaulx; “and if the  matter of the appointment is not satisfactorily arranged within six days  our names will be substituted in place of yours.”    “You are deep,” cried the secretary.    “Exactly,” said Gobseck.    “And this is all?” exclaimed des Lupeaulx.    “All,” said Gobseck.    “You agree?” asked Gigonnet.    Des Lupeaulx nodded his head.    “Well, then, sign this power of attorney. Within two days Baudoyer is to  be nominated; within six your debts will be cleared off, and--”    “And what?” asked des Lupeaulx.    “We guarantee--”    “Guarantee!--what?” said the secretary, more and more astonished.    “Your election to the Chamber,” said Gigonnet, rising on his heels.  “We have secured a majority of fifty-two farmers’ and mechanics’  votes, which will be thrown precisely as those who lend you this money  dictate.”    Des Lupeaulx wrung Gigonnet’s hand.    “It is only such as we who never misunderstand each other,” he said;  “this is what I call doing business. I’ll make you a return gift.”    “Right,” said Gobseck.    “What is it?” asked Gigonnet.    “The cross of the Legion of honor for your imbecile of a nephew.”    “Good,” said Gigonnet, “I see you know him well.”    The pair took leave of des Lupeaulx, who conducted them to the  staircase.    “They must be secret envoys from foreign powers,” whispered the footmen  to each other.    Once in the street, the two usurers looked at each other under a street  lamp and laughed.    “He will owe us nine thousand francs interest a year,” said Gigonnet;  “that property doesn’t bring him in five.”    “He is under our thumb for a long time,” said Gobseck.    “He’ll build; he’ll commit extravagancies,” continued Gigonnet; “Falleix  will get his land.”    “His interest is only to be made deputy; the old fox laughs at the  rest,” said Gobseck.    “Hey! hey!”    “Hi! hi!”    These dry little exclamations served as a laugh to the two old men, who  took their way back (always on foot) to the Cafe Themis.    Des Lupeaulx returned to the salon and found Madame Rabourdin sailing  with the wind of success, and very charming; while his Excellency,  usually so gloomy, showed a smooth and gracious countenance.    “She performs miracles,” thought des Lupeaulx. “What a wonderfully  clever woman! I must get to the bottom of her heart.”    “Your little lady is decidedly handsome,” said the Marquise to the  secretary; “now if she only had your name.”    “Yes, her defect is that she is the daughter of an auctioneer. She will  fail for want of birth,” replied des Lupeaulx, with a cold manner  that contrasted strangely with the ardor of his remarks about Madame  Rabourdin not half an hour earlier.    The marquise looked at him fixedly.    “The glance you gave them did not escape me,” she said, motioning  towards the minister and Madame Rabourdin; “it pierced the mask of your  spectacles. How amusing you both are, to quarrel over that bone!”    As the marquise turned to leave the room the minister joined her and  escorted her to the door.    “Well,” said des Lupeaulx to Madame Rabourdin, “what do you think of his  Excellency?”    “He is charming. We must know these poor ministers to appreciate  them,” she added, slightly raising her voice so as to be heard by his  Excellency’s wife. “The newspapers and the opposition calumnies are so  misleading about men in politics that we are all more or less influenced  by them; but such prejudices turn to the advantage of statesmen when we  come to know them personally.”    “He is very good-looking,” said des Lupeaulx.    “Yes, and I assure you he is quite lovable,” she said, heartily.    “Dear child,” said des Lupeaulx, with a genial, caressing manner; “you  have actually done the impossible.”    “What is that?”    “Resuscitated the dead. I did not think that man had a heart; ask his  wife. But he may have just enough for a passing fancy. Therefore profit  by it. Come this way, and don’t be surprised.” He led Madame Rabourdin  into the boudoir, placed her on a sofa, and sat down beside her. “You  are very sly,” he said, “and I like you the better for it. Between  ourselves, you are a clever woman. Des Lupeaulx served to bring you  into this house, and that is all you wanted of him, isn’t it? Now when a  woman decides to love a man for what she can get out of him it is better  to take a sexagenarian Excellency than a quadragenarian secretary;  there’s more profit and less annoyance. I’m a man with spectacles,  grizzled hair, worn out with dissipation,--a fine lover, truly! I tell  myself all this again and again. It must be admitted, of course, that I  can sometimes be useful, but never agreeable. Isn’t that so? A man must  be a fool if he cannot reason about himself. You can safely admit the  truth and let me see to the depths of your heart; we are partners, not  lovers. If I show some tenderness at times, you are too superior a woman  to pay any attention to such follies; you will forgive me,--you are not  a school-girl, or a bourgeoise of the rue Saint-Denis. Bah! you and I  are too well brought up for that. There’s the Marquise d’Espard who has  just left the room; this is precisely what she thinks and does. She and  I came to an understanding two years ago [the coxcomb!], and now she has  only to write me a line and say, ‘My dear des Lupeaulx, you will oblige  me by doing such and such a thing,’ and it is done at once. We are  engaged at this very moment in getting a commission of lunacy on her  husband. Ah! you women, you can get what you want by the bestowal of a  few favors. Well, then, my dear child, bewitch the minister. I’ll help  you; it is my interest to do so. Yes, I wish he had a woman who could  influence him; he wouldn’t escape me,--for he does escape me quite  often, and the reason is that I hold him only through his intellect.  Now if I were one with a pretty woman who was also intimate with him,  I should hold him by his weaknesses, and that is much the firmest grip.  Therefore, let us be friends, you and I, and share the advantages of the  conquest you are making.”    Madame Rabourdin listened in amazement to this singular profession of  rascality. The apparent artlessness of this political swindler prevented  her from suspecting a trick.    “Do you believe he really thinks of me?” she asked, falling into the  trap.    “I know it; I am certain of it.”    “Is it true that Rabourdin’s appointment is signed?”    “I gave him the papers this morning. But it is not enough that your  husband should be made director; he must be Master of petitions.”    “Yes,” she said.    “Well, then, go back to the salon and coquette a little more with his  Excellency.”    “It is true,” she said, “that I never fully understood you till  to-night. There is nothing commonplace about /you/.”    “We will be two old friends,” said des Lupeaulx, “and suppress all  tender nonsense and tormenting love; we will take things as they did  under the Regency. Ah! they had plenty of wit and wisdom in those days!”    “You are really strong; you deserve my admiration,” she said, smiling,  and holding out her hand to him, “one does more for one’s friend, you  know, than for one’s--”    She left him without finishing her sentence.    “Dear creature!” thought des Lupeaulx, as he saw her approach the  minister, “des Lupeaulx has no longer the slightest remorse in turning  against you. To-morrow evening when you offer me a cup of tea, you will  be offering me a thing I no longer care for. All is over. Ah! when a man  is forty years of age women may take pains to catch him, but they won’t  love him.”    He looked himself over in a mirror, admitting honestly that though he  did very well as a politician he was a wreck on the shores of Cythera.  At the same moment Madame Rabourdin was gathering herself together for  a becoming exit. She wished to make a last graceful impression on  the minds of all, and she succeeded. Contrary to the usual custom in  society, every one cried out as soon as she was gone, “What a charming  woman!” and the minister himself took her to the outer door.    “I am quite sure you will think of me to-morrow,” he said, alluding to  the appointment.    “There are so few high functionaries who have agreeable wives,” remarked  his Excellency on re-entering the room, “that I am very well satisfied  with our new acquisition.”    “Don’t you think her a little overpowering?” said des Lupeaulx with a  piqued air.    The women present all exchanged expressive glances; the rivalry between  the minister and his secretary amused them and instigated one of those  pretty little comedies which Parisian women play so well. They excited  and led on his Excellency and des Lupeaulx by a series of comments on  Madame Rabourdin: one thought her too studied in manner, too eager to  appear clever; another compared the graces of the middle classes with  the manners of high life, while des Lupeaulx defended his pretended  mistress as we all defend an enemy in society.    “Do her justice, ladies,” he said; “is it not extraordinary that the  daughter of an auctioneer should appear as well as she does? See where  she came from, and what she is. She will end in the Tuileries; that is  what she intends,--she told me so.”    “Suppose she is the daughter of an auctioneer,” said the Comtesse  Feraud, smiling, “that will not hinder her husband’s rise to power.”    “Not in these days, you mean,” said the minister’s wife, tightening her  lips.    “Madame,” said his Excellency to the countess, sternly, “such sentiments  and such speeches lead to revolutions; unhappily, the court and the  great world do not restrain them. You would hardly believe, however, how  the injudicious conduct of the aristocracy in this respect displeases  certain clear-sighted personages at the palace. If I were a great lord,  instead of being, as I am, a mere country gentleman who seems to be  placed where he is to transact your business for you, the monarchy would  not be as insecure as I now think it is. What becomes of a throne which  does not bestow dignity on those who administer its government? We are  far indeed from the days when a king could make men great at will,--such  men as Louvois, Colbert, Richelieu, Jeannin, Villeroy, Sully,--Sully,  in his origin, was no greater than I. I speak to you thus because we  are here in private among ourselves. I should be very paltry indeed if  I were personally offended by such speeches. After all, it is for us and  not for others to make us great.”    “You are appointed, dear,” cried Celestine, pressing her husband’s hand  as they drove away. “If it had not been for des Lupeaulx I should have  explained your scheme to his Excellency. But I will do it next Tuesday,  and it will help the further matter of making you Master of petitions.”    In the life of every woman there comes a day when she shines in all  her glory; a day which gives her an unfading recollection to which she  recurs with happiness all her life. As Madame Rabourdin took off one by  one the ornaments of her apparel, she thought over the events of this  evening, and marked the day among the triumphs and glories of her  life,--all her beauties had been seen and envied, she had been praised  and flattered by the minister’s wife, delighted thus to make the other  women jealous of her; but, above all, her grace and vanities had shone  to the profit of conjugal love. Her husband was appointed.    “Did you think I looked well to-night?” she said to him, joyously.    At the same instant Mitral, waiting at the Cafe Themis, saw the two  usurers returning, but was unable to perceive the slightest indications  of the result on their impassible faces.    “What of it?” he said, when they were all seated at table.    “Same as ever,” replied Gigonnet, rubbing his hands, “victory with  gold.”    “True,” said Gobseck.    Mitral took a cabriolet and went straight to the Saillards and  Baudoyers, who were still playing boston at a late hour. No one was  present but the Abbe Gaudron. Falleix, half-dead with the fatigue of his  journey, had gone to bed.    “You will be appointed, nephew,” said Mitral; “and there’s a surprise in  store for you.”    “What is it?” asked Saillard.    “The cross of the Legion of honor?” cried Mitral.    “God protects those who guard his altars,” said Gaudron.    Thus the Te Deum was sung with equal joy and confidence in both camps.          CHAPTER VIII. FORWARD, MOLLUSKS!      The next day, Wednesday, Monsieur Rabourdin was to transact business  with the minister, for he had filled the late La Billardiere’s place  since the beginning of the latter’s illness. On such days the clerks  came punctually, the servants were specially attentive, there was always  a certain excitement in the offices on these signing-days,--and why,  nobody ever knew. On this occasion the three servants were at their  post, flattering themselves they should get a few fees; for a rumor of  Rabourdin’s nomination had spread through the ministry the night before,  thanks to Dutocq. Uncle Antoine and Laurent had donned their full  uniform, when, at a quarter to eight, des Lupeaulx’s servant came in  with a letter, which he begged Antoine to give secretly to Dutocq,  saying that the general-secretary had ordered him to deliver it without  fail at Monsieur Dutocq’s house by seven o’clock.    “I’m sure I don’t know how it happened,” he said, “but I overslept  myself. I’ve only just waked up, and he’d play the devil’s tattoo on me  if he knew the letter hadn’t gone. I know a famous secret, Antoine; but  don’t say anything about it to the clerks if I tell you; promise? He  would send me off if he knew I had said a single word; he told me so.”    “What’s inside the letter?” asked Antoine, eying it.    “Nothing; I looked this way--see.”    He made the letter gape open, and showed Antoine that there was nothing  but blank paper to be seen.    “This is going to be a great day for you, Laurent,” went on the  secretary’s man. “You are to have a new director. Economy must be the  order of the day, for they are going to unite the two divisions under  one director--you fellows will have to look out!”    “Yes, nine clerks are put on the retired list,” said Dutocq, who came in  at the moment; “how did you hear that?”    Antoine gave him the letter, and he had no sooner opened it than he  rushed headlong downstairs in the direction of the secretary’s office.    The bureaus Rabourdin and Baudoyer, after idling and gossiping since  the death of Monsieur de la Billardiere, were now recovering their usual  official look and the dolce far niente habits of a government office.  Nevertheless, the approaching end of the year did cause rather more  application among the clerks, just as porters and servants become at  that season more unctuously civil. They all came punctually, for one  thing; more remained after four o’clock than was usual at other times.  It was not forgotten that fees and gratuities depend on the last  impressions made upon the minds of masters. The news of the union of the  two divisions, that of La Billardiere and that of Clergeot, under one  director, had spread through the various offices. The number of the  clerks to be retired was known, but all were in ignorance of the names.  It was taken for granted that Poiret would not be replaced, and that  would be a retrenchment. Little La Billardiere had already departed.  Two new supernumeraries had made their appearance, and, alarming  circumstance! they were both sons of deputies. The news told about  in the offices the night before, just as the clerks were dispersing,  agitated all minds, and for the first half-hour after arrival in the  morning they stood around the stoves and talked it over. But earlier  than that, Dutocq, as we have seen, had rushed to des Lupeaulx on  receiving his note, and found him dressing. Without laying down his  razor, the general-secretary cast upon his subordinate the glance of a  general issuing an order.    “Are we alone?” he asked.    “Yes, monsieur.”    “Very good. March on Rabourdin; forward! steady! Of course you kept a  copy of that paper?”    “Yes.”    “You understand me? Inde iroe! There must be a general hue and cry  raised against him. Find some way to start a clamor--”    “I could get a man to make a caricature, but I haven’t five hundred  francs to pay for it.”    “Who would make it?”    “Bixou.”    “He shall have a thousand and be under-head-clerk to Colleville, who  will arrange with them; tell him so.”    “But he wouldn’t believe it on nothing more than my word.”    “Are you trying to make me compromise myself? Either do the thing or let  it alone; do you hear me?”    “If Monsieur Baudoyer were director--”    “Well, he will be. Go now, and make haste; you have no time to lose.  Go down the back-stairs; I don’t want people to know you have just seen  me.”    While Dutocq was returning to the clerks’ office and asking himself how  he could best incite a clamor against his chief without compromising  himself, Bixiou rushed to the Rabourdin office for a word of greeting.  Believing that he had lost his bet the incorrigible joker thought it  amusing to pretend that he had won it.    Bixiou [mimicking Phellion’s voice]. “Gentlemen, I salute you with a  collective how d’ye do, and I appoint Sunday next for the dinner at  the Rocher de Cancale. But a serious question presents itself. Is that  dinner to include the clerks who are dismissed?”    Poiret. “And those who retire?”    Bixiou. “Not that I care, for it isn’t I who pay.” [General  stupefaction.] “Baudoyer is appointed. I think I already hear him  calling Laurent” [mimicking Baudoyer], “Laurent! lock up my hair-shirt,  and my scourge.” [They all roar with laughter.] “Yes, yes, he laughs  well who laughs last. Gentlemen, there’s a great deal in that anagram of  Colleville’s. ‘Xavier Rabourdin, chef de bureau--D’abord reva bureaux,  e-u fin riche.’ If I were named ‘Charles X., par la grace de Dieu roi  de France et de Navarre,’ I should tremble in my shoes at the fate those  letters anagrammatize.”    Thuillier. “Look here! are you making fun?”    Bixiou. “No, I am not. Rabourdin resigns in a rage at finding Baudoyer  appointed director.”    Vimeux [entering.] “Nonsense, no such thing! Antoine (to whom I have  just been paying forty francs that I owed him) tells me that Monsieur  and Madame Rabourdin were at the minister’s private party last night and  stayed till midnight. His Excellency escorted Madame Rabourdin to the  staircase. It seems she was divinely dressed. In short, it is quite  certain that Rabourdin is to be director. Riffe, the secretary’s copying  clerk, told me he sat up all the night before to draw the papers; it is  no longer a secret. Monsieur Clergeot is retired. After thirty years’  service that’s no misfortune. Monsieur Cochlin, who is rich--”    Bixiou. “By cochineal.”    Vimeux. “Yes, cochineal; he’s a partner in the house of Matifat, rue des  Lombards. Well, he is retired; so is Poiret. Neither is to be replaced.  So much is certain; the rest is all conjecture. The appointment of  Monsieur Rabourdin is to be announced this morning; they are afraid of  intrigues.”    Bixiou. “What intrigues?”    Fleury. “Baudoyer’s, confound him! The priests uphold him; here’s  another article in the liberal journal,--only half a dozen lines, but  they are queer” [reads]:      “Certain persons spoke last night in the lobby of the Opera-house    of the return of Monsieur de Chateaubriand to the ministry, basing    their opinion on the choice made of Monsieur Rabourdin (the    protege of friends of the noble viscount) to fill the office for    which Monsieur Baudoyer was first selected. The clerical party is    not likely to withdraw unless in deference to the great writer.    “Blackguards!”    Dutocq [entering, having heard the whole discussion]. “Blackguards! Who?  Rabourdin? Then you know the news?”    Fleury [rolling his eyes savagely]. “Rabourdin a blackguard! Are you  mad, Dutocq? do you want a ball in your brains to give them weight?”    Dutocq. “I said nothing against Monsieur Rabourdin; only it has just  been told to me in confidence that he has written a paper denouncing all  the clerks and officials, and full of facts about their lives; in short,  the reason why his friends support him is because he has written this  paper against the administration, in which we are all exposed--”    Phellion [in a loud voice]. “Monsieur Rabourdin is incapable of--”    Bixiou. “Very proper in you to say so. Tell me, Dutocq” [they whisper  together and then go into the corridor].    Bixiou. “What has happened?”    Dutocq. “Do you remember what I said to you about that caricature?”    Bixiou. “Yes, what then?”    Dutocq. “Make it, and you shall be under-head-clerk with a famous fee.  The fact is, my dear fellow, there’s dissension among the powers that  be. The minister is pledged to Rabourdin, but if he doesn’t appoint  Baudoyer he offends the priests and their party. You see, the King, the  Dauphin and the Dauphine, the clergy, and lastly the court, all want  Baudoyer; the minister wants Rabourdin.”    Bixiou. “Good!”    Dutocq. “To ease the matter off, the minister, who sees he must give  way, wants to strangle the difficulty. We must find some good reason for  getting rid of Rabourdin. Now somebody has lately unearthed a paper of  his, exposing the present system of administration and wanting to  reform it; and that paper is going the rounds,--at least, this is how I  understand the matter. Make the drawing we talked of; in so doing you’ll  play the game of all the big people, and help the minister, the court,  the clergy,--in short, everybody; and you’ll get your appointment. Now  do you understand me?”    Bixiou. “I don’t understand how you came to know all that; perhaps you  are inventing it.”    Dutocq. “Do you want me to let you see what Rabourdin wrote about you?”    Bixiou. “Yes.”    Dutocq. “Then come home with me; for I must put the document into safe  keeping.”    Bixiou. “You go first alone.” [Re-enters the bureau Rabourdin.] “What  Dutocq told you is really all true, word of honor! It seems that  Monsieur Rabourdin has written and sent in very unflattering  descriptions of the clerks whom he wants to ‘reform.’ That’s the real  reason why his secret friends wish him appointed. Well, well; we live in  days when nothing astonishes me” [flings his cloak about him like Talma,  and declaims]:--      “Thou who has seen the fall of grand, illustrious heads,    Why thus amazed, insensate that thou art,    to find a man like Rabourdin employing such means? Baudoyer is too much  of a fool to know how to use them. Accept my congratulations, gentlemen;  either way you are under a most illustrious chief” [goes off].    Poiret. “I shall leave this ministry without ever comprehending a single  word that gentleman utters. What does he mean with his ‘heads that  fall’?”    Fleury. “‘Heads that fell?’ why, think of the four sergeants of  Rochelle, Ney, Berton, Caron, the brothers Faucher, and the massacres.”    Phellion. “He asserts very flippantly things that he only guesses at.”    Fleury. “Say at once that he lies; in his mouth truth itself turns to  corrosion.”    Phellion. “Your language is unparliamentary and lacks the courtesy and  consideration which are due to a colleague.”    Vimeux. “It seems to me that if what he says is false, the proper  name for it is calumny, defamation of character; and such a slanderer  deserves the thrashing.”    Fleury [getting hot]. “If the government offices are public places, the  matter ought to be taken into the police-courts.”    Phellion [wishing to avert a quarrel, tries to turn the conversation].  “Gentleman, might I ask you to keep quiet? I am writing a little  treatise on moral philosophy, and I am just at the heart of it.”    Fleury [interrupting]. “What are you saying about it, Monsieur  Phellion?”    Phellion [reading]. “Question.--What is the soul of man?    “Answer.--A spiritual substance which thinks and reasons.”    Thuillier. “Spiritual substance! you might as well talk about immaterial  stone.”    Poiret. “Don’t interrupt; let him go on.”    Phellion [continuing]. “Quest.--Whence comes the soul?    “Ans.--From God, who created it of a nature one and indivisible; the  destructibility thereof is, consequently, not conceivable, and he hath  said--”    Poiret [amazed]. “God said?”    Phellion. “Yes, monsieur; tradition authorizes the statement.”    Fleury [to Poiret]. “Come, don’t interrupt, yourself.”    Phellion [resuming]. “--and he hath said that he created it immortal; in  other words, the soul can never die.    “Quest.--What are the uses of the soul?    “Ans.--To comprehend, to will, to remember; these constitute  understanding, volition, memory.    “Quest.--What are the uses of the understanding?    “Ans.--To know. It is the eye of the soul.”    Fleury. “And the soul is the eye of what?”    Phellion [continuing]. “Quest.--What ought the understanding to know?    “Ans.--Truth.    “Quest.--Why does man possess volition?    “Ans.--To love good and hate evil.    “Quest.--What is good?    “Ans.--That which makes us happy.”    Vimeux. “Heavens! do you teach that to young ladies?”    Phellion. “Yes” [continuing]. “Quest.--How many kinds of good are  there?”    Fleury. “Amazingly indecorous, to say the least.”    Phellion [aggrieved]. “Oh, monsieur!” [Controlling himself.] “But here’s  the answer,--that’s as far as I have got” [reads]:--    “Ans.--There are two kinds of good,--eternal good and temporal good.”    Poiret [with a look of contempt]. “And does that sell for anything?”    Phellion. “I hope it will. It requires great application of mind to  carry on a system of questions and answers; that is why I ask you to be  quiet and let me think, for the answers--”    Thuillier [interrupting]. “The answers might be sold separately.”    Poiret. “Is that a pun?”    Thuillier. “No; a riddle.”    Phellion. “I am sorry I interrupted you” [he dives into his office  desk]. “But” [to himself] “at any rate, I have stopped their talking  about Monsieur Rabourdin.”    At this moment a scene was taking place between the minister and des  Lupeaulx which decided Rabourdin’s fate. The general-secretary had gone  to see the minister in his private study before the breakfast-hour, to  make sure that La Briere was not within hearing.    “Your Excellency is not treating me frankly--”    “He means a quarrel,” thought the minister; “and all because his  mistress coquetted with me last night. I did not think you so juvenile,  my dear friend,” he said aloud.    “Friend?” said the general-secretary, “that is what I want to find out.”    The minister looked haughtily at des Lupeaulx.    “We are alone,” continued the secretary, “and we can come to an  understanding. The deputy of the arrondissement in which my estate is  situated--”    “So it is really an estate!” said the minister, laughing, to hide his  surprise.    “Increased by a recent purchase of two hundred thousand francs’ worth of  adjacent property,” replied des Lupeaulx, carelessly. “You knew of the  deputy’s approaching resignation at least ten days ago, and you did not  tell me of it. You were perhaps not bound to do so, but you knew very  well that I am most anxious to take my seat in the centre. Has  it occurred to you that I might fling myself back on the  ‘Doctrine’?--which, let me tell you, will destroy the administration and  the monarchy both if you continue to allow the party of representative  government to be recruited from men of talent whom you ignore. Don’t you  know that in every nation there are fifty to sixty, not more, dangerous  heads, whose schemes are in proportion to their ambition? The secret of  knowing how to govern is to know those heads well, and either to chop  them off or buy them. I don’t know how much talent I have, but I know  that I have ambition; and you are committing a serious blunder when you  set aside a man who wishes you well. The anointed head dazzles for the  time being, but what next?--Why, a war of words; discussions will spring  up once more and grow embittered, envenomed. Then, for your own sake, I  advise you not to find me at the Left Centre. In spite of your  prefect’s manoeuvres (instructions for which no doubt went from here  confidentially) I am secure of a majority. The time has come for you and  me to understand each other. After a breeze like this people sometimes  become closer friends than ever. I must be made count and receive the  grand cordon of the Legion of honor as a reward for my public services.  However, I care less for those things just now than I do for something  else in which you are more personally concerned. You have not yet  appointed Rabourdin, and I have news this morning which tends to show  that most persons will be better satisfied if you appoint Baudoyer.”    “Appoint Baudoyer!” echoed the minister. “Do you know him?”    “Yes,” said des Lupeaulx; “but suppose he proves incapable, as he will,  you can then get rid of him by asking those who protect him to employ  him elsewhere. You will thus get back an important office to give  to friends; it may come in at the right moment to facilitate some  compromise.”    “But I have pledged it to Rabourdin.”    “That may be; and I don’t ask you to make the change this very day.  I know the danger of saying yes and no within twenty-four hours. But  postpone the appointment, and don’t sign the papers till the day  after to-morrow; by that time you may find it impossible to retain  Rabourdin,--in fact, in all probability, he will send you his  resignation--”    “His resignation?”    “Yes.”    “Why?”    “He is the tool of a secret power in whose interests he has carried on  a system of espionage in all the ministries, and the thing has been  discovered by mere accident. He has written a paper of some kind, giving  short histories of all the officials. Everybody is talking of it; the  clerks are furious. For heaven’s sake, don’t transact business with him  to-day; let me find some means for you to avoid it. Ask an audience  of the King; I am sure you will find great satisfaction there if you  concede the point about Baudoyer; and you can obtain something as an  equivalent. Your position will be better than ever if you are forced  later to dismiss a fool whom the court party impose upon you.”    “What has made you turn against Rabourdin?”    “Would you forgive Monsieur de Chateaubriand for writing an article  against the ministry? Well, read that, and see how Rabourdin has treated  me in his secret document,” said des Lupeaulx, giving the paper to the  minister. “He pretends to reorganize the government from beginning to  end,--no doubt in the interests of some secret society of which, as  yet, we know nothing. I shall continue to be his friend for the sake  of watching him; by that means I may render the government such signal  service that they will have to make me count; for the peerage is the  only thing I really care for. I want you fully to understand that I am  not seeking office or anything else that would cause me to stand in your  way; I am simply aiming for the peerage, which will enable me to marry a  banker’s daughter with an income of a couple of hundred thousand francs.  And so, allow me to render you a few signal services which will make the  King feel that I have saved the throne. I have long said that Liberalism  would never offer us a pitched battle. It has given up conspiracies,  Carbonaroism, and revolts with weapons; it is now sapping and mining,  and the day is coming when it will be able to say, ‘Out of that and let  me in!’ Do you think I have been courting Rabourdin’s wife for my own  pleasure? No, but I got much information from her. So now, let us agree  on two things; first, the postponement of the appointment; second,  your /sincere/ support of my election. You shall find at the end of the  session that I have amply repaid you.”    For all answer, the minister took the appointment papers and placed them  in des Lupeaulx’s hand.    “I will go and tell Rabourdin,” added des Lupeaulx, “that you cannot  transact business with him till Saturday.”    The minister replied with an assenting gesture. The secretary despatched  his man with a message to Rabourdin that the minister could not work  with him until Saturday, on which day the Chamber was occupied with  private bills, and his Excellency had more time at his disposal.    Just at this moment Saillard, having brought the monthly stipend, was  slipping his little speech into the ear of the minister’s wife, who  drew herself up and answered with dignity that she did not meddle in  political matters, and besides, she had heard that Monsieur Rabourdin  was already appointed. Saillard, terrified, rushed up to Baudoyer’s  office, where he found Dutocq, Godard, and Bixiou in a state of  exasperation difficult to describe; for they were reading the terrible  paper on the administration in which they were all discussed.    Bixiou [with his finger on a paragraph]. “Here /you/ are, pere Saillard.  Listen” [reads]:--    “Saillard.--The office of cashier to be suppressed in all the  ministries; their accounts to be kept in future at the Treasury.  Saillard is rich and does not need a pension.    “Do you want to hear about your son-in-law?” [Turns over the leaves.]  “Here he is” [reads]:--    “Baudoyer.--Utterly incapable. To be thanked and dismissed. Rich; does  not need a pension.    “And here’s for Godard” [reads]:--    “Godard.--Should be dismissed; pension one-third of his present salary.    “In short, here we all are. Listen to what I am” [reads]: “An artist  who might be employed by the civil list, at the Opera, or the  Menus-Plaisirs, or the Museum. Great deal of capacity, little  self-respect, no application,--a restless spirit. Ha! I’ll give you a  touch of the artist, Monsieur Rabourdin!”    Saillard. “Suppress cashiers! Why, the man’s a monster?”    Bixiou. “Let us see what he says of our mysterious Desroys.” [Turns over  the pages; reads.]    “Desroys.--Dangerous; because he cannot be shaken in principles that are  subversive of monarchial power. He is the son of the Conventionel, and  he admires the Convention. He may become a very mischievous journalist.”    Baudoyer. “The police are not worse spies!”    Godard. “I shall go the general-secretary and lay a complaint in form;  we must all resign in a body if such a man as that is put over us.”    Dutocq. “Gentlemen, listen to me; let us be prudent. If you rise at  once in a body, we may all be accused of rancor and revenge. No, let  the thing work, let the rumor spread quietly. When the whole ministry is  aroused your remonstrances will meet with general approval.”    Bixiou. “Dutocq believes in the principles of the grand air composed by  the sublime Rossini for Basilio,--which goes to show, by the bye, that  the great composer was also a great politician. I shall leave my card  on Monsieur Rabourdin to-morrow morning, inscribed thus: ‘Bixiou; no  self-respect, no application, restless mind.’”    Godard. “A good idea, gentlemen. Let us all leave our cards to-morrow on  Rabourdin inscribed in the same way.”    Dutocq [leading Bixiou apart]. “Come, you’ll agree to make that  caricature now, won’t you?”    Bixiou. “I see plainly, my dear fellow, that you knew all about  this affair ten days ago” [looks him in the eye]. “Am I to be  under-head-clerk?”    Dutocq. “On my word of honor, yes, and a thousand-franc fee beside,  just as I told you. You don’t know what a service you’ll be rendering to  powerful personages.”    Bixiou. “You know them?”    Dutocq. “Yes.”    Bixiou. “Well, then I want to speak with them.”    Dutocq [dryly]. “You can make the caricature or not, and you can be  under-head-clerk or not,--as you please.”    Bixiou. “At any rate, let me see that thousand francs.”    Dutocq. “You shall have them when you bring the drawing.”    Bixiou. “Forward, march! that lampoon shall go from end to end of the  bureaus to-morrow morning. Let us go and torment the Rabourdins.” [Then  speaking to Saillard, Godard, and Baudoyer, who were talking together in  a low voice.] “We are going to stir up the neighbors.” [Goes with Dutocq  into the Rabourdin bureau. Fleury, Thuillier, and Vimeux are there,  talking excitedly.] “What’s the matter, gentlemen? All that I told you  turns out to be true; you can go and see for yourselves the work of  this infamous informer; for it is in the hands of the virtuous, honest,  estimable, upright, and pious Baudoyer, who is indeed utterly incapable  of doing any such thing. Your chief has got every one of you under the  guillotine. Go and see; follow the crowd; money returned if you are not  satisfied; execution /gratis/! The appointments are postponed. All the  bureaus are in arms; Rabourdin has been informed that the minister will  not work with him. Come, be off; go and see for yourselves.”    They all depart except Phellion and Poiret, who are left alone. The  former loved Rabourdin too well to look for proof that might injure a  man he was determined not to judge; the other had only five days more to  remain in the office, and cared nothing either way. Just then Sebastien  came down to collect the papers for signature. He was a good deal  surprised, though he did not show it, to find the office deserted.    Phellion. “My young friend” [he rose, a rare thing], “do you know what  is going on? what scandals are rife about Monsieur Rabourdin whom you  love, and” [bending to whisper in Sebastien’s ear] “whom I love as much  as I respect him. They say he has committed the imprudence to leave a  paper containing comments on the officials lying about in the office--”   [Phellion stopped short, caught the young man in his strong arms, seeing  that he turned pale and was near fainting, and placed him on a chair.]  “A key, Monsieur Poiret, to put down his back; have you a key?”    Poiret. “I have the key of my domicile.”    [Old Poiret junior promptly inserted the said key between Sebastien’s  shoulders, while Phellion gave him some water to drink. The poor lad  no sooner opened his eyes than he began to weep. He laid his head on  Phellion’s desk, and all his limbs were limp as if struck by lightning;  while his sobs were so heartrending, so genuine, that for the first  time in his life Poiret’s feelings were stirred by the sufferings of  another.]    Phellion [speaking firmly]. “Come, come, my young friend; courage! In  times of trial we must show courage. You are a man. What is the matter?  What has happened to distress you so terribly?”    Sebastien [sobbing]. “It is I who have ruined Monsieur Rabourdin. I left  that paper lying about when I copied it. I have killed my benefactor; I  shall die myself. Such a noble man!--a man who ought to be minister!”    Poiret [blowing his nose]. “Then it is true he wrote the report.”    Sebastien [still sobbing]. “But it was to--there, I was going to tell  his secrets! Ah! that wretch of a Dutocq; it was he who stole the  paper.”    His tears and sobs recommenced and made so much noise that Rabourdin  came up to see what was the matter. He found the young fellow almost  fainting in the arms of Poiret and Phellion.    Rabourdin. “What is the matter, gentlemen?”    Sebastien [struggling to his feet, and then falling on his knees before  Rabourdin]. “I have ruined you, monsieur. That memorandum,--Dutocq, the  monster, he must have taken it.”    Rabourdin [calmly]. “I knew that already” [he lifts Sebastien]. “You are  a child, my young friend.” [Speaks to Phellion.] “Where are the other  gentlemen?”    Phellion. “They have gone into Monsieur Baudoyer’s office to see a paper  which it is said--”    Rabourdin [interrupting him]. “Enough.” [Goes out, taking Sebastien with  him. Poiret and Phellion look at each other in amazement, and do not  know what to say.]    Poiret [to Phellion]. “Monsieur Rabourdin--”    Phellion [to Poiret]. “Monsieur Rabourdin--”    Poiret. “Well, I never! Monsieur Rabourdin!”    Phellion. “But did you notice how calm and dignified he was?”    Poiret [with a sly look that was more like a grimace]. “I shouldn’t be  surprised if there were something under it all.”    Phellion. “A man of honor; pure and spotless.”    Poiret. “Who is?”    Phellion. “Monsieur Poiret, you think as I think about Dutocq; surely  you understand me?”    Poiret [nodding his head three times and answering with a shrewd look].  “Yes.” [The other clerks return.]    Fleury. “A great shock; I still don’t believe the thing. Monsieur  Rabourdin, a king among men! If such men are spies, it is enough to  disgust one with virtue. I have always put Rabourdin among Plutarch’s  heroes.”    Vimeux. “It is all true.”    Poiret [reflecting that he had only five days more to stay in the  office]. “But, gentlemen, what do you say about the man who stole that  paper, who spied upon Rabourdin?” [Dutocq left the room.]    Fleury. “I say he is a Judas Iscariot. Who is he?”    Phellion [significantly]. “He is not here at /this moment/.”    Vimeux [enlightened]. “It is Dutocq!”    Phellion. “I have no proof of it, gentlemen. While you were gone, that  young man, Monsieur de la Roche, nearly fainted here. See his tears on  my desk!”    Poiret. “We held him fainting in our arms.--My key, the key of my  domicile!--dear, dear! it is down his back.” [Poiret goes hastily out.]    Vimeux. “The minister refused to transact business with Rabourdin  to-day; and Monsieur Saillard, to whom the secretary said a few words,  cam",36.8,14.0,18.7,10.17,22.3,7.04,2184,15.0,20.28,18th and 19th grade
26,The Secrets of the Princesse de Cadignanr,"true son of the old Prince de Cadignan,  is a tall, lean man, of elegant shape, very graceful, a sayer of witty  things, colonel by the grace of God, and a good soldier by accident;  brave as a Pole, which means without sense or discernment, and hiding  the emptiness of his mind under the jargon of good society. After the  age of thirty-six he was forced to be as absolutely indifferent to  the fair sex as his master Charles X., punished, like that master, for  having pleased it too well. For eighteen years the idol of the faubourg  Saint-Germain, he had, like other heirs of great families led a  dissipated life, spent solely on pleasure. His father, ruined by the  revolution, had somewhat recovered his position on the return of the  Bourbons, as governor of a royal domain, with salary and perquisites;  but this uncertain fortune the old prince spent, as it came, in keeping  up the traditions of a great seigneur before the revolution; so that  when the law of indemnity was passed, the sums he received were all  swallowed up in the luxury he displayed in his vast hotel.    The old prince died some little time before the revolution of July aged  eighty-seven. He had ruined his wife, and had long been on bad terms  with the Duc de Navarreins, who had married his daughter for a first  wife, and to whom he very reluctantly rendered his accounts. The Duc  de Maufrigneuse, early in life, had had relations with the Duchesse  d�Uxelles. About the year 1814, when Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was  forty-six years of age, the duchess, pitying his poverty, and seeing  that he stood very well at court, gave him her daughter Diane, then in  her seventeenth year, and possessing, in her own right, some fifty or  sixty thousand francs a year, not counting her future expectations.  Mademoiselle d�Uxelles thus became a duchess, and, as her mother very  well knew, she enjoyed the utmost liberty. The duke, after obtaining  the unexpected happiness of an heir, left his wife entirely to her  own devices, and went off to amuse himself in the various garrisons of  France, returning occasionally to Paris, where he made debts which his  father paid. He professed the most entire conjugal indulgence, always  giving the duchess a week�s warning of his return; he was adored by  his regiment, beloved by the Dauphin, an adroit courtier, somewhat of  a gambler, and totally devoid of affectation. Having succeeded to his  father�s office as governor of one of the royal domains, he managed to  please the two kings, Louis XVIII. and Charles X., which proves he made  the most of his nonentity; and even the liberals liked him; but his  conduct and life were covered with the finest varnish; language, noble  manners, and deportment were brought by him to a state of perfection.  But, as the old prince said, it was impossible for him to continue the  traditions of the Cadignans, who were all well known to have ruined  their wives, for the duchess was running through her property on her own  account.    These particulars were so well understood in the court circles and  in the faubourg Saint-Germain, that during the last five years of  the Restoration they were considered ancient history, and any one who  mentioned them would have been laughed at. Women never spoke of the  charming duke without praising him; he was excellent, they said, to his  wife; could a man be better? He had left her the entire disposal of her  own property, and had always defended her on every occasion. It is  true that, whether from pride, kindliness, or chivalry, Monsieur de  Maufrigneuse had saved the duchess under various circumstances which  might have ruined other women, in spite of Diane�s surroundings, and  the influence of her mother and that of the Duc de Navarreins, her  father-in-law, and her husband�s aunt.    For several ensuing days the princess revealed herself to d�Arthez as  remarkable for her knowledge of literature. She discussed with perfect  fearlessness the most difficult questions, thanks to her daily and  nightly reading, pursued with an intrepidity worthy of the highest  praise. D�Arthez, amazed, and incapable of suspecting that Diane  d�Uxelles merely repeated at night that which she read in the morning  (as some writers do), regarded her as a most superior woman. These  conversations, however, led away from Diane�s object, and she tried to  get back to the region of confidences from which d�Arthez had prudently  retired after her coquettish rebuff; but it was not as easy as she  expected to bring back a man of his nature who had once been startled  away.    However, after a month of literary campaigning and the finest platonic  discourses, d�Arthez grew bolder, and arrived every day at three  o�clock. He retired at six, and returned at nine, to remain until  midnight, or one in the morning, with the regularity of an ardent and  impatient lover. The princess was always dressed with more or less  studied elegance at the hour when d�Arthez presented himself. This  mutual fidelity, the care they each took of their appearance, in fact,  all about them expressed sentiments that neither dared avow, for the  princess discerned very plainly that the great child with whom she had  to do shrank from the combat as much as she desired it. Nevertheless  d�Arthez put into his mute declarations a respectful awe which was  infinitely pleasing to her. Both felt, every day, all the more united  because nothing acknowledged or definite checked the course of their  ideas, as occurs between lovers when there are formal demands on one  side, and sincere or coquettish refusals on the other.    Like all men younger than their actual age, d�Arthez was a prey to those  agitating irresolutions which are caused by the force of desires and  the terror of displeasing,--a situation which a young woman does not  comprehend when she shares it, but which the princess had too often  deliberately produced not to enjoy its pleasures. In fact, Diane enjoyed  these delightful juvenilities all the more keenly because she knew that  she could put an end to them at any moment. She was like a great artist  delighting in the vague, undecided lines of his sketch, knowing well  that in a moment of inspiration he can complete the masterpiece still  waiting to come to birth. Many a time, seeing d�Arthez on the point  of advancing, she enjoyed stopping him short, with an imposing air and  manner. She drove back the hidden storms of that still young heart,  raised them again, and stilled them with a look, holding out her hand  to be kissed, or saying some trifling insignificant words in a tender  voice.    These manoeuvres, planned in cold blood, but enchantingly executed,  carved her image deeper and deeper on the soul of that great writer and  thinker whom she revelled in making childlike, confiding, simple, and  almost silly beside her. And yet she had moments of repulsion against  her own act, moments in which she could not help admiring the grandeur  of such simplicity. This game of choicest coquetry attached her,  insensibly, to her slave. At last, however, Diane grew impatient with  an Epictetus of love; and when she thought she had trained him to the  utmost credulity, she set to work to tie a thicker bandage still over  his eyes.          CHAPTER IV. THE CONFESSION OF A PRETTY WOMAN      One evening Daniel found the princess thoughtful, one elbow resting on  a little table, her beautiful blond head bathed in light from the lamp.  She was toying with a letter which lay on the table-cloth. When d�Arthez  had seen the paper distinctly, she folded it up, and stuck it in her  belt.    �What is the matter?� asked d�Arthez; �you seem distressed.�    �I have received a letter from Monsieur de Cadignan,� she replied.  �However great the wrongs he has done me, I cannot help thinking of his  exile--without family, without son--from his native land.�    These words, said in a soulful voice, betrayed angelic sensibility.  D�Arthez was deeply moved. The curiosity of the lover became, so to  speak, a psychological and literary curiosity. He wanted to know the  height that woman had attained, and what were the injuries she thus  forgave; he longed to know how these women of the world, taxed with  frivolity, cold-heartedness, and egotism, could be such angels.  Remembering how the princess had already repulsed him when he first  tried to read that celestial heart, his voice, and he himself, trembled  as he took the transparent, slender hand of the beautiful Diane with its  curving finger-tips, and said,--    �Are we now such friends that you will tell me what you have suffered?�    �Yes,� she said, breathing forth the syllable like the most mellifluous  note that Tulou�s flute had ever sighed.    Then she fell into a revery, and her eyes were veiled. Daniel remained  in a state of anxious expectation, impressed with the solemnity of the  occasion. His poetic imagination made him see, as it were, clouds slowly  dispersing and disclosing to him the sanctuary where the wounded lamb  was kneeling at the divine feet.    �Well?� he said, in a soft, still voice.    Diane looked at the tender petitioner; then she lowered her eyes slowly,  dropping their lids with a movement of noble modesty. None but a  monster would have been capable of imagining hypocrisy in the graceful  undulation of the neck with which the princess again lifted her charming  head, to look once more into the eager eyes of that great man.    �Can I? ought I?� she murmured, with a gesture of hesitation, gazing at  d�Arthez with a sublime expression of dreamy tenderness. �Men have so  little faith in things of this kind; they think themselves so little  bound to be discreet!�    �Ah! if you distrust me, why am I here?� cried d�Arthez.    �Oh, friend!� she said, giving to the exclamation the grace of an  involuntary avowal, �when a woman attaches herself for life, think you  she calculates? It is not question of refusal (how could I refuse you  anything?), but the idea of what you may think of me if I speak. I would  willingly confide to you the strange position in which I am at my age;  but what would you think of a woman who could reveal the secret wounds  of her married life? Turenne kept his word to robbers; do I not owe to  my torturers the honor of a Turenne?�    �Have you passed your word to say nothing?�    �Monsieur de Cadignan did not think it necessary to bind me to  secrecy--You are asking more than my soul! Tyrant! you want me to bury  my honor itself in your breast,� she said, casting upon d�Arthez a  look, by which she gave more value to her coming confidence than to her  personal self.    �You must think me a very ordinary man, if you fear any evil, no matter  what, from me,� he said, with ill-concealed bitterness.    �Forgive me, friend,� she replied, taking his hand in hers caressingly,  and letting her fingers wander gently over it. �I know your worth. You  have related to me your whole life; it is noble, it is beautiful, it is  sublime, and worthy of your name; perhaps, in return, I owe you mine.  But I fear to lower myself in your eyes by relating secrets which  are not wholly mine. How can you believe--you, a man of solitude and  poesy--the horrors of social life? Ah! you little think when you invent  your dramas that they are far surpassed by those that are played in  families apparently united. You are wholly ignorant of certain gilded  sorrows.�    �I know all!� he cried.    �No, you know nothing.�    D�Arthez felt like a man lost on the Alps of a dark night, who sees,  at the first gleam of dawn, a precipice at his feet. He looked at the  princess with a bewildered air, and felt a cold chill running down his  back. Diane thought for a moment that her man of genius was a weakling,  but a flash from his eyes reassured her.    �You have become to me almost my judge,� she said, with a desperate air.  �I must speak now, in virtue of the right that all calumniated beings  have to show their innocence. I have been, I am still (if a poor recluse  forced by the world to renounce the world is still remembered) accused  of such light conduct, and so many evil things, that it may be allowed  me to find in one strong heart a haven from which I cannot be driven.  Hitherto I have always considered self-justification an insult to  innocence; and that is why I have disdained to defend myself. Besides,  to whom could I appeal? Such cruel things can be confided to none but  God or to one who seems to us very near Him--a priest, or another self.  Well! I do know this, if my secrets are not as safe there,� she said,  laying her hand on d�Arthez�s heart, �as they are here� (pressing the  upper end of her busk beneath her fingers), �then you are not the grand  d�Arthez I think you--I shall have been deceived.�    A tear moistened d�Arthez�s eyes, and Diane drank it in with a side  look, which, however, gave no motion either to the pupils or the lids of  her eyes. It was quick and neat, like the action of a cat pouncing on a  mouse.    D�Arthez, for the first time, after sixty days of protocols, ventured  to take that warm and perfumed hand, and press it to his lips with a  long-drawn kiss, extending from the wrist to the tip of the fingers,  which made the princess augur well of literature. She thought to herself  that men of genius must know how to love with more perfection than  conceited fops, men of the world, diplomatists, and even soldiers,  although such beings have nothing else to do. She was a connoisseur, and  knew very well that the capacity for love reveals itself chiefly in mere  nothings. A woman well informed in such matters can read her future in  a simple gesture; just as Cuvier could say from the fragment of a bone:  This belonged to an animal of such or such dimensions, with or without  horns, carnivorous, herbivorous, amphibious, etc., age, so many thousand  years. Sure now of finding in d�Arthez as much imagination in love as  there was in his written style, she thought it wise to bring him up at  once to the highest pitch of passion and belief.    She withdrew her hand hastily, with a magnificent movement full of  varied emotions. If she had said in words: �Stop, or I shall die,� she  could not have spoken more plainly. She remained for a moment with  her eyes in d�Arthez�s eyes, expressing in that one glance happiness,  prudery, fear, confidence, languor, a vague longing, and virgin modesty.  She was twenty years old! but remember, she had prepared for this hour  of comic falsehood by the choicest art of dress; she was there in her  armchair like a flower, ready to blossom at the first kiss of sunshine.  True or false, she intoxicated Daniel.    It if is permissible to risk a personal opinion we must avow that it  would be delightful to be thus deceived for a good long time. Certainly  Talma on the stage was often above and beyond nature, but the Princesse  de Cadignan is the greatest true comedian of our day. Nothing was  wanting to this woman but an attentive audience. Unfortunately, at  epochs perturbed by political storms, women disappear like water-lilies  which need a cloudless sky and balmy zephyrs to spread their bloom to  our enraptured eyes.    The hour had come; Diane was now to entangle that great man in the  inextricable meshes of a romance carefully prepared, to which he was  fated to listen as the neophyte of early Christian times listened to the  epistles of an apostle.    �My friend,� began Diane, �my mother, who still lives at Uxelles,  married me in 1814, when I was seventeen years old (you see how old I am  now!) to Monsieur de Maufrigneuse, not out of affection for me, but out  of regard for him. She discharged her debt to the only man she had ever  loved, for the happiness she had once received from him. Oh! you need  not be astonished at so horrible a conspiracy; it frequently takes  place. Many women are more lovers than mothers, though the majority  are more mothers than wives. The two sentiments, love and motherhood,  developed as they are by our manners and customs, often struggle  together in the hearts of women; one or other must succumb when they  are not of equal strength; when they are, they produce some exceptional  women, the glory of our sex. A man of your genius must surely comprehend  many things that bewilder fools but are none the less true; indeed I may  go further and call them justifiable through difference of characters,  temperaments, attachments, situations. I, for example, at this moment,  after twenty years of misfortunes, of deceptions, of calumnies endured,  and weary days and hollow pleasures, is it not natural that I should  incline to fall at the feet of a man who would love me sincerely and  forever? And yet, the world would condemn me. But twenty years of  suffering might well excuse a few brief years which may still remain to  me of youth given to a sacred and real love. This will not happen. I am  not so rash as to sacrifice my hopes of heaven. I have borne the burden  and heat of the day, I shall finish my course and win my recompense.�    �Angel!� thought d�Arthez.    �After all, I have never blamed my mother; she knew little of me.  Mothers who lead a life like that of the Duchesse d�Uxelles keep their  children at a distance. I saw and knew nothing of the world until my  marriage. You can judge of my innocence! I knew nothing; I was incapable  of understanding the causes of my marriage. I had a fine fortune; sixty  thousand francs a year in forests, which the Revolution overlooked (or  had not been able to sell) in the Nivernais, with the noble chateau of  d�Anzy. Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was steeped in debt. Later I learned  what it was to have debts, but then I was too utterly ignorant of life  to suspect my position; the money saved out of my fortune went to pacify  my husband�s creditors. Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was forty-eight years  of age when I married him; but those years were like military campaigns,  they ought to count for twice what they were. Ah! what a life I led for  ten years! If any one had known the suffering of this poor, calumniated  little woman! To be watched by a mother jealous of her daughter!  Heavens! You who make dramas, you will never invent anything as direful  as that. Ordinarily, according to the little that I know of literature,  a drama is a suite of actions, speeches, movements which hurry to a  catastrophe; but what I speak of was a catastrophe in action. It was an  avalanche fallen in the morning and falling again at night only to  fall again the next day. I am cold now as I speak to you of that cavern  without an opening, cold, sombre, in which I lived. I, poor little thing  that I was! brought up in a convent like a mystic rose, knowing nothing  of marriage, developing late, I was happy at first; I enjoyed the  goodwill and harmony of our family. The birth of my poor boy, who is  all me--you must have been struck by the likeness? my hair, my eyes, the  shape of my face, my mouth, my smile, my teeth!--well, his birth was a  relief to me; my thoughts were diverted by the first joys of maternity  from my husband, who gave me no pleasure and did nothing for me that  was kind or amiable; those joys were all the keener because I knew no  others. It had been so often rung into my ears that a mother should  respect herself. Besides, a young girl loves to play the mother. I was  so proud of my flower--for Georges was beautiful, a miracle, I thought!  I saw and thought of nothing but my son, I lived with my son. I never  let his nurse dress or undress him. Such cares, so wearing to mothers  who have a regiment of children, were all my pleasure. But after three  or four years, as I was not an actual fool, light came to my eyes in  spite of the pains taken to blindfold me. Can you see me at that  final awakening, in 1819? The drama of �The Brothers at enmity� is a  rose-water tragedy beside that of a mother and daughter placed as we  then were. But I braved them all, my mother, my husband, the world,  by public coquetries which society talked of,--and heaven knows how it  talked! You can see, my friend, how the men with whom I was accused of  folly were to me the dagger with which to stab my enemies. Thinking only  of my vengeance, I did not see or feel the wounds I was inflicting on  myself. Innocent as a child, I was thought a wicked woman, the worst of  women, and I knew nothing of it! The world is very foolish, very blind,  very ignorant; it can penetrate no secrets but those which amuse it and  serve its malice: noble things, great things, it puts its hand before  its eyes to avoid seeing. But, as I look back, it seems to me that I had  an attitude and aspect of indignant innocence, with movements of pride,  which a great painter would have recognized. I must have enlivened many  a ball with my tempests of anger and disdain. Lost poesy! such sublime  poems are only made in the glowing indignation which seizes us at  twenty. Later, we are wrathful no longer, we are too weary, vice no  longer amazes us, we are cowards, we fear. But then--oh! I kept a great  pace! For all that I played the silliest personage in the world; I was  charged with crimes by which I never benefited. But I had such pleasure  in compromising myself. That was my revenge! Ah! I have played many  childish tricks! I went to Italy with a thoughtless youth, whom I  crushed when he spoke to me of love, but later, when I herd that he was  compromised on my account (he had committed a forgery to get money) I  rushed to save him. My mother and husband kept me almost without means;  but, this time, I went to the king. Louis XVIII., that man without a  heart, was touched; he gave me a hundred thousand francs from his privy  purse. The Marquis d�Esgrignon--you must have seen him in society for he  ended by making a rich marriage--was saved from the abyss into which he  had plunged for my sake. That adventure, caused by my own folly, led me  to reflect. I saw that I myself was the first victim of my vengeance.  My mother, who knew I was too proud, too d�Uxelles, to conduct  myself really ill, began to see the harm that she had done me and was  frightened by it. She was then fifty-two years of age; she left Paris  and went to live at Uxelles. There she expiates her wrong-doing by a  life of devotion and expresses the utmost affection for me. After her  departure I was face to face, alone, with Monsieur de Maufrigneuse. Oh!  my friend, you men can never know what an old man of gallantry can be.  What a home is that of a man accustomed to the adulation of women of the  world, when he finds neither incense nor censer in his own house! dead  to all! and yet, perhaps for that very reason, jealous. I wished--when  Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was wholly mine--I wished to be a good wife,  but I found myself repulsed with the harshness of a soured spirit by  a man who treated me like a child and took pleasure in humiliating  my self-respect at every turn, in crushing me under the scorn of his  experience, and in convicting me of total ignorance. He wounded me on  all occasions. He did everything to make me detest him and to give me  the right to betray him; but I was still the dupe of my own hope and of  my desire to do right through several years. Shall I tell you the cruel  saying that drove me to further follies? �The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse  has gone back to her husband,� said the world. �Bah! it is always a  triumph to bring the dead to life; it is all she can now do,� replied my  best friend, a relation, she, at whose house I met you--�    �Madame d�Espard!� cried Daniel, with a gesture of horror.    �Oh! I have forgiven her. Besides, it was very witty; and I have myself  made just as cruel epigrams on other poor women as innocent as myself.�    D�Arthez again kissed the hand of that saintly woman who, having hacked  her mother in pieces, and turned the Prince de Cadignan into an Othello,  now proceeded to accuse herself in order to appear in the eyes of that  innocent great man as immaculate as the silliest or the wisest of women  desire to seem at all costs to their lovers.    �You will readily understand, my friend, that I returned to society for  the purpose of excitement and I may say of notoriety. I felt that I must  conquer my independence. I led a life of dissipation. To divert my mind,  to forget my real life in fictitious enjoyments I was gay, I shone, I  gave fetes, I played the princess, and I ran in debt. At home I could  forget myself in the sleep of weariness, able to rise the next day gay,  and frivolous for the world; but in that sad struggle to escape my real  life I wasted my fortune. The revolution of 1830 came; it came at the  very moment when I had met, at the end of that _Arabian Nights�_ life, a  pure and sacred love which (I desire to be honest) I had longed to know.  Was it not natural in a woman whose heart, repressed by many causes and  accidents, was awakening at an age when a woman feels herself cheated  if she has never known, like the women she sees about her, a happy love?  Ah! why was Michel Chrestien so respectful? Why did he not seek to meet  me? There again was another mockery! But what of that? in falling, I  have lost everything; I have no illusions left; I had tasted of all  things except the one fruit for which I have no longer teeth. Yes, I  found myself disenchanted with the world at the very moment when I was  forced to leave it. Providential, was it not? like all those strange  insensibilities which prepare us for death� (she made a gesture full  of pious unction). �All things served me then,� she continued; �the  disasters of the monarchy and its ruin helped me to bury myself. My son  consoles me for much. Maternal love takes the place of all frustrated  feelings. The world is surprised at my retirement, but to me it has  brought peace. Ah! if you knew how happy the poor creature before you is  in this little place. In sacrificing all to my son I forget to think of  joys of which I am and ever must be ignorant. Yes, hope has flown, I  now fear everything; no doubt I should repulse the truest sentiment,  the purest and most veritable love, in memory of the deceptions and the  miseries of my life. It is all horrible, is it not? and yet, what I have  told you is the history of many women.�    The last few words were said in a tone of easy pleasantry which recalled  the presence of the woman of the world. D�Arthez was dumbfounded. In his  eyes convicts sent to the galleys for murder, or aggravated robbery, or  for putting a wrong name to checks, were saints compared to the men and  women of society. This atrocious elegy, forged in the arsenal of lies,  and steeped in the waters of the Parisian Styx, had been poured into his  ears with the inimitable accent of truth. The grave author contemplated  for a moment that adorable woman lying back in her easy-chair, her two  hands pendant from its arms like dewdrops from a rose-leaf, overcome  by her own revelation, living over again the sorrows of her life as she  told them--in short an angel of melancholy.    �And judge,� she cried, suddenly lifting herself with a spring and  raising her hand, while lightning flashed from eyes where twenty chaste  years shone--�judge of the impression the love of a man like Michel  must have made upon me. But by some irony of fate--or was it the hand of  God?--well, he died; died in saving the life of, whom do you suppose? of  Monsieur de Cadignan. Are you now surprised to find me thoughtful?�    This was the last drop; poor d�Arthez could bear no more. He fell upon  his knees, and laid his head on Diane�s hand, weeping soft tears such  as the angels shed,--if angels weep. As Daniel was in that bent posture,  Madame de Cadignan could safely let a malicious smile of triumph flicker  on her lips, a smile such as the monkeys wear after playing a sly  trick--if monkeys smile.    �Ah! I have him,� thought she; and, indeed, she had him fast.    �But you are--� he said, raising his fine head and looking at her with  eyes of love.    �Virgin and martyr,� she replied, smiling at the commonness of that  hackneyed expression, but giving it a freshness of meaning by her smile,  so full of painful gayety. �If I laugh,� she continued, �it is that I am  thinking of that princess whom the world thinks it knows, that Duchesse  de Maufrigneuse to whom it gives as lovers de Marsay, that infamous de  Trailles (a political cutthroat), and that little fool of a d�Esgrignon,  and Rastignac, Rubempre, ambassadors, ministers, Russian generals,  heaven knows who! all Europe! They have gossiped about that album which  I ordered made, believing that those who admired me were my friends. Ah!  it is frightful! I wonder that I allow a man at my feet! Despise them  all, THAT should be my religion.�    She rose and went to the window with a gait and bearing magnificent in  motifs.    D�Arthez remained on the low seat to which he had returned not daring  to follow the princess; but he looked at her; he heard her blowing her  nose. Was there ever a princess who blew her nose? but Diane attempted  the impossible to convey an idea of her sensibility. D�Arthez believed  his angel was in tears; he rushed to her side, took her round the waist,  and pressed her to his heart.    �No, no, leave me!� she murmured in a feeble voice. �I have too many  doubts to be good for anything. To reconcile me with life is a task  beyond the powers of any man.�    �Diane! I will love you for your whole lost life.�    �No; don�t speak to me thus,� she answered. �At this moment I tremble, I  am ashamed as though I had committed the greatest sins.�    She was now entirely restored to the innocence of little girls, and  yet her bearing was august, grand, noble as that of a queen. It is  impossible to describe the effect of these manoeuvres, so clever that  they acted like the purest truth on a soul as fresh and honest as that  of d�Arthez. The great author remained dumb with admiration, passive  beside her in the recess of that window awaiting a word, while the  princess awaited a kiss; but she was far too sacred to him for that.  Feeling cold, the princess returned to her easy-chair; her feet were  frozen.    �It will take a long time,� she said to herself, looking at Daniel�s  noble brow and head.    �Is this a woman?� thought that profound observer of human nature. �How  ought I to treat her?�    Until two o�clock in the morning they spent their time in saying to each  other the silly things that women of genius, like the princess, know how  to make adorable. Diane pretended to be too worn, too old, too faded;  D�Arthez proved to her (facts of which she was well convinced) that her  skin was the most delicate, the softest to the touch, the whitest to the  eye, the most fragrant; she was young and in her bloom, how could she  think otherwise? Thus they disputed, beauty by beauty, detail by detail  with many: �Oh! do you think so?�--�You are beside yourself!�--�It is  hope, it is fancy!�--�You will soon see me as I am.--I am almost forty  years of age. Can a man love so old a woman?�    D�Arthez responded with impetuous and school-boy eloquence, larded with  exaggerated epithets. When the princess heard this wise and witty writer  talking the nonsense of an amorous sub-lieutenant she listened with an  absorbed air and much sensibility; but she laughed in her sleeve.    When d�Arthez was in the street, he asked himself whether he might not  have been rather less respectful. He went over in memory those strange  confidences--which have, naturally, been much abridged here, for they  needed a volume to convey their mellifluous abundance and the graces  which accompanied them. The retrospective perspicacity of this man, so  natural, so profound, was baffled by the candor of that tale and its  poignancy, and by the tones of the princess.    �It is true,� he said to himself, being unable to sleep, �there are such  dramas as that in society. Society covers great horrors with the flowers  of its elegance, the embroidery of its gossip, the wit of its lies. We  writers invent no more than the truth. Poor Diane! Michel had penetrated  that enigma; he said that beneath her covering of ice there lay  volcanoes! Bianchon and Rastignac were right; when a man can join the  grandeurs of the ideal and the enjoyments of human passion in loving  a woman of perfect manners, of intellect, of delicacy, it must be  happiness beyond words.�    So thinking, he sounded the love that was in him and found it infinite.          CHAPTER V. A TRIAL OF FAITH      The next day, about two in the afternoon, Madame d�Espard, who had seen  and heard nothing of the princess for more than a month, went to see her  under the impulse of extreme curiosity. Nothing was ever more amusing  of its kind than the conversation of these two crafty adders during the  first half-hour of this visit.    Diane d�Uxelles cautiously avoided, as she would the wearing of a yellow  gown, all mention of d�Arthez. The marquise circled round and round that  topic like a Bedouin round a caravan. Diane amused herself; the marquise  fumed. Diane waited; she intended to utilize her friend and use her in  the chase. Of these two women, both so celebrated in the social world,  one was far stronger than the other. The princess rose by a head  above the marquise, and the marquise was inwardly conscious of that  superiority. In this, perhaps, lay the secret of their intimacy. The  weaker of the two crouched low in her false attachment, watching for the  hour, long awaited by feeble beings, of springing at the throat of the  stronger and leaving the mark of a joyful bite. Diane saw clear; but the  world was the dupe of the wile caresses of the two friends.    The instant that the princess perceived a direct question on the lips of  her friend, she said:--    �Ah! dearest, I owe you a most complete, immense, infinite, celestial  happiness.�    �What can you mean?�    �Have you forgotten what we ruminated three months ago in the little  garden, sitting on a bench in the sun, under the jasmine? Ah! there are  none but men of genius who know how to love! I apply to my grand Daniel  d�Arthez the Duke of Alba�s saying to Catherine de� Medici: �The head of  a single salmon is worth all the frogs in the world.��    �I am not surprised that I no longer see you,� said Madame d�Espard.    �Promise me, if you meet him, not to say to him one word about me, my  angel,� said the princess, taking her friend�s hand. �I am happy, oh!  happy beyond all expression; but you know that in society a word, a mere  jest can do much harm. One speech can kill, for they put such venom into  a single sentence! Ah! if you knew how I long that you might meet with  a love like this! Yes, it is a sweet, a precious triumph for women like  ourselves to end our woman�s life in this way; to rest in an ardent,  pure, devoted, complete and absolute love; above all, when we have  sought it long.�    �Why do you ask me to be faithful to my dearest friend?� said Madame  d�Espard. �Do you think me capable of playing you some villainous  trick?�    �When a woman possesses such a treasure the fear of losing it is so  strong that it naturally inspires a feeling of terror. I am absurd, I  know; forgive me, dear.�    A few moments later the marquise departed; as she watched her go the  princess said to herself:--    �How she will pluck me! But to save her the trouble of trying to get  Daniel away from here I�ll send him to her.�    At three o�clock, or a few moments after, d�Arthez arrived. In the midst  of some interesting topic on which he was discoursing eloquently, the  princess suddenly cut him short by laying her hand on his arm.    �Pardon me, my dear friend,� she said, interrupting him, �but I fear  I may forget a thing which seems a mere trifle but may be of great  importance. You have not set foot in Madame d�Espard�s salon since the  ever-blessed day when I met you there. Pray go at once; not for your  sake, nor by way of politeness, but for me. You may already have made  her an enemy of mine, if by chance she has discovered that since her  dinner you have scarcely left my house. Besides, my friend, I don�t like  to see you dropping your connection with society, and neglecting your  occupations and your work. I should again be strangely calumniated. What  would the world say? That I held you in leading-strings, absorbed you,  feared comparisons, and clung to my conquest knowing it to be my last!  Who will know that you are my friend, my only friend? If you love me  indeed, as you say you love me, you will make the world believe that  we are purely and simply brother and sister--Go on with what you were  saying.�    In his armor of tenderness, riveted by the knowledge of so many splendid  virtues, d�Arthez obeyed this behest on the following day and went  to see Madame d�Espard, who received him with charming coquetry. The  marquise took very good care not to say a single word to him about the  princess, but she asked him to dinner on a coming day.    On this occasion d�Arthez found a numerous company. The marquise  had invited Rastignac, Blondet, the Marquis d�Ajuda-Pinto, Maxime de  Trailles, the Marquis d�Esgrignon, the two brothers Vandenesse, du  Tillet, one of the richest bankers in Paris, the Baron de Nucingen,  Raoul Nathan, Lady Dudley, two very treacherous secretaries of embassies  and the Chevalier d�Espard, the wiliest person in this assemblage and  the chief instigator of his sister-in-law�s policy.    When dinner was well under way, Maxime de Trailles turned to d�Arthez  and said smiling:--    �You see a great deal, don�t you, of the Princesse de Cadignan?�    To this question d�Arthez responded by curtly nodding his head. Maxime  de Trailles was a �bravo� of the social order, without faith or law,  capable of everything, ruining the women who trusted him, compelling  them to pawn their diamonds to give him money, but covering this conduct  with a brilliant varnish; a man of charming manners and satanic mind.  He inspired all who knew him with equal contempt and fear; but as no  one was bold enough to show him any sentiments but those of the utmost  courtesy he saw nothing of this public opinion, or else he accepted and  shared the general dissimulation. He owed to the Comte de Marsay the  greatest degree of elevation to which he could attain. De Marsay,  whose knowledge of Maxime was of long-standing, judged him capable of  fulfilling certain secret and diplomatic functions which he confided to  him and of which de Trailles acquitted himself admirably. D�Arthez had  for some time past mingled sufficiently in political matters to know the  man for what he was, and he alone had sufficient strength and height of  character to express aloud what others thought or said in a whisper.    �Is it for her that you neglect the Chamber?� asked Baron de Nucingen in  his German accent.    �Ah! the princess is one of the most dangerous women a man can have  anything to do with. I owe to her the miseries of my marriage,�   exclaimed the Marquis d�Esgrignon.    �Dangerous?� said Madame d�Espard. �Don�t speak so of my nearest friend.  I have never seen or known anything in the princess that did not seem to  come from the noblest sentiments.�    �Let the marquis say what he thinks,� cried Rastignac. �When a man has  been thrown by a fine horse he thinks it has vices and he sells it.�    Piqued by these words, the Marquis d�Esgrignon looked at d�Arthez and  said:--    �Monsieur is not, I trust, on such terms with the princess that we  cannot speak freely of her?�    D�Arthez kept silence. D�Esgrignon, who was not wanting in cleverness,  replied to Rastignac�s speech with an apologetic portrait of the  princess, which put the whole table in good humor. As the jest was  extremely obscure to d�Arthez he leaned towards his neighbor, Madame de  Montcornet, and asked her, in a whisper, what it meant.    �Excepting yourself--judging by the excellent opinion you seem to have  of the princess--all the other guests are said to have been in her good  graces.�    �I can assure you that such an accusation is absolutely false,� said  Daniel.    �And yet, here is Monsieur d�Esgrignon of an old family of Alencon, who  completely ruined himself for her some twelve years ago, and, if all is  true, came very near going to the scaffold.�    �I know the particulars of that affair,� said d�Arthez. �Madame de  Cadignan went to Alencon to save Monsieur d�Esgrignon from a trial  before the court of assizes; and this is how he rewards her to-day!�    Madame de Montcornet looked at d�Arthez with a surprise and curiosity  that were almost stupid, then she turned her eyes on Madame d�Espard  with a look which seemed to say: �He is bewitched!�    During this short conversation Madame de Cadignan was protected by  Madame d�Espard, whose protection was like that of the lightning-rod  which draws the flash. When d�Arthez returned to the general  conversation Maxime de Trailles was saying:--    �With Diane, depravity is not an effect but a cause; perhaps she owes  that cause to her exquisite nature; she doesn�t invent, she makes no  effort, she offers you the choicest refinements as the inspiration of  a spontaneous and naive love; and it is absolutely impossible not to  believe her.�    This speech, which seemed to have been prepared for a man of d�Arthez�s  stamp, was so tremendous an arraignment that the company appeared to  accept it as a conclusion. No one said more; the princess was crushed.  D�Arthez looked straight at de Trailles and then at d�Esgrignon with a  sarcastic air, and said:--    �The greatest fault of that woman is that she has followed in the wake  of men. She squanders patrimonies as they do; she drives her lovers to  usurers; she pockets �dots�; she ruins orphans; she inspires, possibly  she commits, crimes, but--�    Never had the two men, whom d�Arthez was chiefly addressing, listened  to such plain talk. At that BUT the whole table was startled, every one  paused, fork in air, their eyes fixed alternately on the brave author  and on the assailants of the princess, awaiting the conclusion of that  horrible silence.    �_But_,� said d�Arthez, with sarcastic airiness, �Madame la Princesse  de Cadignan has one advantage over men: when they have put themselves in  danger for her sake, she saves them, and says no harm of any one. Among  the multitude, why shouldn�t there be one woman who amuses herself with  men as men amuse themselves with women? Why not allow the fair sex to  take, from time to time, its revenge?�    �Genius is stronger than wit,� said Blondet to Nathan.    This broadside of sarcasms was in fact the discharge of a battery of  cannons against a platoon of musketry. When coffee was served, Blondet  and Nathan went up to d�Arthez with an eagerness no one else dared to  imitate, so unable were the rest of the company to show the admiration  his conduct inspired from the fear of making two powerful enemies.    �This is not the first time we have seen that your character equals your  talent in grandeur,� said Blondet. �You behaved just now more like a  demi-god than a man. Not to have been carried away by your heart or  your imagination, not to have taken up the defence of a beloved woman--a  fault they were enticing you to commit, because it would have given  those men of society eaten up with jealousy of your literary fame a  triumph over you--ah! give me leave to say you have attained the height  of private statesmanship.�    �Yes, you are a statesman,� said Nathan. �It is as clever as it is  difficult to avenge a woman without defending her.�    �The princess is one of those heroines of the legitimist party, and  it is the duty of all men of honor to protect her quand meme,� replied  d�Arthez, coldly. �What she has done for the cause of her masters would  excuse all follies.�    �He keeps his own counsel!� said Nathan to Blondet.    �Precisely as if the princess were worth it,� said Rastignac, joining  the other two.    D�Arthez went to the princess, who was awaiting him with the keenest  anxiety. The result of this experiment, which Diane had herself brought  about, might be fatal to her. For the first time in her life this woman  suffered in her heart. She knew not what she should do in case d�Arthez  believed the world which spoke the truth, instead of believing her who  lied; for never had so noble a nature, so complete a man, a soul so  pure, a conscience so ingenuous come beneath her hand. Though she had  told him cruel lies she was driven to do so by the desire of knowing a  true love. That love--she felt it dawning in her heart; yes, she loved  d�Arthez; and now she was condemned forever to deceive him! She must  henceforth remain to him the actress who had played that comedy to blind  his eyes.    When she heard Daniel�s step in the dining-room a violent commotion, a  shudder which reached to her very vitals came over her. That convulsion,  never felt during all the years of her adventurous existence, told her  that she had staked her happiness on this issue. Her eyes, gazing  into space, took in the whole of d�Arthez�s person; their light poured  through his flesh, she read his soul; suspicion had not so much as  touched him with its bat�s-wing. The terrible emotion of that fear then  came to its reaction; joy almost stifled her; for there is no human  being who is not more able to endure grief than to bear extreme  felicity.    �Daniel, they have calumniated me, and you have avenged me!� she cried,  rising, and opening her arms to him.    In the profound amazement caused by these words, the roots of which were  utterly unknown to him, Daniel allowed his hand to be taken between her  beautiful hands, as the princess kissed him sacredly on the forehead.    �But,� he said, �how could you know--�    �Oh! illustrious ninny! do you not see that I love you fondly?�    Since that day nothing has been said of the Princess de Cadignan, nor  of d�Arthez. The princess has inherited some fortune from her mother and  she spends all her summers in a villa on the lake of Geneva, where the  great writer joins her. She returns to Paris for a few months in winter.  D�Arthez is never seen except in the Chamber. His writings are becoming  exceedingly rare. Is this a conclusion? Yes, for people of sense; no,  for persons who want to know everything.          ADDENDUM    The following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.

27,The Vicar of Toursr,"Meanwhile Mademoiselle Salomon de Villenoix was announced. She came from  Tours in the hope of being useful to the poor abbe, and the news she  brought completely changed the aspect of the affair. As she entered,  every one except Monsieur de Bourbonne was urging Birotteau to hold his  own against Troubert and Gamard, under the auspices of the aristocratic  society of the place, which would certainly stand by him.    “The vicar-general, to whom the appointments to office are entrusted, is  very ill,” said Mademoiselle Salomon, “and the archbishop has delegated  his powers to the Abbe Troubert provisionally. The canonry will, of  course, depend wholly upon him. Now last evening, at Mademoiselle de la  Blottiere’s the Abbe Poirel talked about the annoyances which the Abbe  Birotteau had inflicted on Mademoiselle Gamard, as though he were trying  to cast all the blame on our good abbe. ‘The Abbe Birotteau,’ he said,  ‘is a man to whom the Abbe Chapeloud was absolutely necessary, and  since the death of that venerable man, he has shown’--and then came  suggestions, calumnies! you understand?”    “Troubert will be made vicar-general,” said Monsieur de Bourbonne,  sententiously.    “Come!” cried Madame de Listomere, turning to Birotteau, “which do  you prefer, to be made a canon, or continue to live with Mademoiselle  Gamard?”    “To be a canon!” cried the whole company.    “Well, then,” resumed Madame de Listomere, “you must let the Abbe  Troubert and Mademoiselle Gamard have things their own way. By sending  Caron here they mean to let you know indirectly that if you consent  to leave the house you shall be made canon,--one good turn deserves  another.”    Every one present applauded Madame de Listomere’s sagacity, except her  nephew the Baron de Listomere, who remarked in a comic tone to Monsieur  de Bourbonne, “I would like to have seen a fight between the Gamard and  the Birotteau.”    But, unhappily for the vicar, forces were not equal between these  persons of the best society and the old maid supported by the Abbe  Troubert. The time soon came when the struggle developed openly, went  on increasing, and finally assumed immense proportions. By the advice  of Madame de Listomere and most of her friends, who were now eagerly  enlisted in a matter which threw such excitement into their vapid  provincial lives, a servant was sent to bring back Monsieur Caron.  The lawyer returned with surprising celerity, which alarmed no one but  Monsieur de Bourbonne.    “Let us postpone all decision until we are better informed,” was the  advice of that Fabius in a dressing-gown, whose prudent reflections  revealed to him the meaning of these moves on the Tourainean  chess-board. He tried to enlighten Birotteau on the dangers of his  position; but the wisdom of the old “sly-boots” did not serve the  passions of the moment, and he obtained but little attention.    The conference between the lawyer and Birotteau was short. The vicar  came back quite terrified.    “He wants me to sign a paper stating my relinquishment of domicile.”    “That’s formidable language!” said the naval lieutenant.    “What does it mean?” asked Madame de Listomere.    “Merely that the abbe must declare in writing his intention of leaving  Mademoiselle Gamard’s house,” said Monsieur de Bourbonne, taking a pinch  of snuff.    “Is that all?” said Madame de Listomere. “Then sign it at once,” she  added, turning to Birotteau. “If you positively decide to leave her  house, there can be no harm in declaring that such is your will.”    Birotteau’s will!    “That is true,” said Monsieur de Bourbonne, closing his snuff-box with a  gesture the significance of which it is impossible to render, for it  was a language in itself. “But writing is always dangerous,” he added,  putting his snuff-box on the mantelpiece with an air and manner that  alarmed the vicar.    Birotteau was so bewildered by the upsetting of all his ideas, by the  rapidity of events which found him defenceless, by the ease with which  his friends were settling the most cherished matters of his solitary  life, that he remained silent and motionless as if moonstruck, thinking  of nothing, though listening and striving to understand the meaning of  the rapid sentences the assembled company addressed to him. He took the  paper Monsieur Caron had given him and read it, as if he were giving  his mind to the lawyer’s document, but the act was merely mechanical.  He signed the paper, by which he declared that he left Mademoiselle  Gamard’s house of his own wish and will, and that he had been fed and  lodged while there according to the terms originally agreed upon. When  the vicar had signed the document, Monsieur Caron took it and asked  where his client was to send the things left by the abbe in her house  and belonging to him. Birotteau replied that they could be sent to  Madame de Listomere’s,--that lady making him a sign that she would  receive him, never doubting that he would soon be a canon. Monsieur de  Bourbonne asked to see the paper, the deed of relinquishment, which the  abbe had just signed. Monsieur Caron gave it to him.    “How is this?” he said to the vicar after reading it. “It appears that  written documents already exist between you and Mademoiselle Gamard.  Where are they? and what do they stipulate?”    “The deed is in my library,” replied Birotteau.    “Do you know the tenor of it?” said Monsieur de Bourbonne to the lawyer.    “No, monsieur,” said Caron, stretching out his hand to regain the fatal  document.    “Ha!” thought the old man; “you know, my good friend, what that deed  contains, but you are not paid to tell us,” and he returned the paper to  the lawyer.    “Where can I put my things?” cried Birotteau; “my books, my beautiful  book-shelves, and pictures, my red furniture, and all my treasures?”    The helpless despair of the poor man thus torn up as it were by the  roots was so artless, it showed so plainly the purity of his ways  and his ignorance of the things of life, that Madame de Listomere and  Mademoiselle de Salomon talked to him and consoled him in the tone which  mothers take when they promise a plaything to their children.    “Don’t fret about such trifles,” they said. “We will find you some place  less cold and dismal than Mademoiselle Gamard’s gloomy house. If we  can’t find anything you like, one or other of us will take you to live  with us. Come, let’s play a game of backgammon. To-morrow you can go and  see the Abbe Troubert and ask him to push your claims to the canonry,  and you’ll see how cordially he will receive you.”    Feeble folk are as easily reassured as they are frightened. So the poor  abbe, dazzled at the prospect of living with Madame de Listomere, forgot  the destruction, now completed, of the happiness he had so long desired,  and so delightfully enjoyed. But at night before going to sleep, the  distress of a man to whom the fuss of moving and the breaking up of all  his habits was like the end of the world, came upon him, and he racked  his brains to imagine how he could ever find such a good place for his  book-case as the gallery in the old maid’s house. Fancying he saw his  books scattered about, his furniture defaced, his regular life turned  topsy-turvy, he asked himself for the thousandth time why the first year  spent in Mademoiselle Gamard’s house had been so sweet, the second  so cruel. His troubles were a pit in which his reason floundered. The  canonry seemed to him small compensation for so much misery, and  he compared his life to a stocking in which a single dropped stitch  resulted in destroying the whole fabric. Mademoiselle Salomon remained  to him. But, alas, in losing his old illusions the poor priest dared not  trust in any later friendship.    In the “citta dolente” of spinsterhood we often meet, especially in  France, with women whose lives are a sacrifice nobly and daily offered  to noble sentiments. Some remain proudly faithful to a heart which death  tore from them; martyrs of love, they learn the secrets of womanhood  only though their souls. Others obey some family pride (which in our  days, and to our shame, decreases steadily); these devote themselves to  the welfare of a brother, or to orphan nephews; they are mothers while  remaining virgins. Such old maids attain to the highest heroism of their  sex by consecrating all feminine feelings to the help of sorrow.  They idealize womanhood by renouncing the rewards of woman’s destiny,  accepting its pains. They live surrounded by the splendour of their  devotion, and men respectfully bow the head before their faded features.  Mademoiselle de Sombreuil was neither wife nor maid; she was and ever  will be a living poem. Mademoiselle Salomon de Villenoix belonged to  the race of these heroic beings. Her devotion was religiously sublime,  inasmuch as it won her no glory after being, for years, a daily agony.  Beautiful and young, she loved and was beloved; her lover lost his  reason. For five years she gave herself, with love’s devotion, to the  mere mechanical well-being of that unhappy man, whose madness she so  penetrated that she never believed him mad. She was simple in manner,  frank in speech, and her pallid face was not lacking in strength and  character, though its features were regular. She never spoke of the  events of her life. But at times a sudden quiver passed over her as she  listened to the story of some sad or dreadful incident, thus betraying  the emotions that great sufferings had developed within her. She had  come to live at Tours after losing the companion of her life; but she  was not appreciated there at her true value and was thought to be  merely an amiable woman. She did much good, and attached herself,  by preference, to feeble beings. For that reason the poor vicar had  naturally inspired her with a deep interest.    Mademoiselle de Villenoix, who returned to Tours the next morning, took  Birotteau with her and set him down on the quay of the cathedral leaving  him to make his own way to the Cloister, where he was bent on going,  to save at least the canonry and to superintend the removal of his  furniture. He rang, not without violent palpitations of the heart, at  the door of the house whither, for fourteen years, he had come daily,  and where he had lived blissfully, and from which he was now exiled  forever, after dreaming that he should die there in peace like his  friend Chapeloud. Marianne was surprised at the vicar’s visit. He told  her that he had come to see the Abbe Troubert, and turned towards the  ground-floor apartment where the canon lived; but Marianne called to  him:--    “Not there, monsieur le vicaire; the Abbe Troubert is in your old  apartment.”    These words gave the vicar a frightful shock. He was forced to  comprehend both Troubert’s character and the depths of the revenge so  slowly brought about when he found the canon settled in Chapeloud’s  library, seated in Chapeloud’s handsome armchair, sleeping, no doubt, in  Chapeloud’s bed, and disinheriting at last the friend of Chapeloud, the  man who, for so many years, had confined him to Mademoiselle Gamard’s  house, by preventing his advancement in the church, and closing the  best salons in Tours against him. By what magic wand had the present  transformation taken place? Surely these things belonged to Birotteau?  And yet, observing the sardonic air with which Troubert glanced at that  bookcase, the poor abbe knew that the future vicar-general felt certain  of possessing the spoils of those he had so bitterly hated,--Chapeloud  as an enemy, and Birotteau, in and through whom Chapeloud still thwarted  him. Ideas rose in the heart of the poor man at the sight, and plunged  him into a sort of vision. He stood motionless, as though fascinated by  Troubert’s eyes which fixed themselves upon him.    “I do not suppose, monsieur,” said Birotteau at last, “that you intend  to deprive me of the things that belong to me. Mademoiselle may have  been impatient to give you better lodgings, but she ought to have  been sufficiently just to give me time to pack my books and remove my  furniture.”    “Monsieur,” said the Abbe Troubert, coldly, not permitting any sign of  emotion to appear on his face, “Mademoiselle Gamard told me yesterday  of your departure, the cause of which is still unknown to me. If she  installed me here at once, it was from necessity. The Abbe Poirel has  taken my apartment. I do not know if the furniture and things that are  in these rooms belong to you or to Mademoiselle; but if they are  yours, you know her scrupulous honesty; the sanctity of her life is the  guarantee of her rectitude. As for me, you are well aware of my simple  modes of living. I have slept for fifteen years in a bare room without  complaining of the dampness,--which, eventually will have caused my  death. Nevertheless, if you wish to return to this apartment I will cede  it to you willingly.”    After hearing these terrible words, Birotteau forgot the canonry and ran  downstairs as quickly as a young man to find Mademoiselle Gamard. He  met her at the foot of the staircase, on the broad, tiled landing which  united the two wings of the house.    “Mademoiselle,” he said, bowing to her without paying any attention  to the bitter and derisive smile that was on her lips, nor to the  extraordinary flame in her eyes which made them lucent as a tiger’s, “I  cannot understand how it is that you have not waited until I removed my  furniture before--”    “What!” she said, interrupting him, “is it possible that your things  have not been left at Madame de Listomere’s?”    “But my furniture?”    “Haven’t you read your deed?” said the old maid, in a tone which would  have to be rendered in music before the shades of meaning that hatred is  able to put into the accent of every word could be fully shown.    Mademoiselle Gamard seemed to rise in stature, her eyes shone, her face  expanded, her whole person quivered with pleasure. The Abbe Troubert  opened a window to get a better light on the folio volume he was  reading. Birotteau stood as if a thunderbolt had stricken him.  Mademoiselle Gamard made his ears hum when she enunciated in a voice as  clear as a cornet the following sentence:--    “Was it not agreed that if you left my house your furniture should  belong to me, to indemnify me for the difference in the price of board  paid by you and that paid by the late venerable Abbe Chapeloud? Now, as  the Abbe Poirel has just been appointed canon--”    Hearing the last words Birotteau made a feeble bow as if to take leave  of the old maid, and left the house precipitately. He was afraid if he  stayed longer that he should break down utterly, and give too great a  triumph to his implacable enemies. Walking like a drunken man he at last  reached Madame de Listomere’s house, where he found in one of the lower  rooms his linen, his clothing, and all his papers packed in a trunk.  When he eyes fell on these few remnants of his possessions the unhappy  priest sat down and hid his face in his hands to conceal his tears  from the sight of others. The Abbe Poirel was canon! He, Birotteau, had  neither home, nor means, nor furniture!    Fortunately Mademoiselle Salomon happened to drive past the house, and  the porter, who saw and comprehended the despair of the poor abbe, made  a sign to the coachman. After exchanging a few words with Mademoiselle  Salomon the porter persuaded the vicar to let himself be placed, half  dead as he was, in the carriage of his faithful friend, to whom he  was unable to speak connectedly. Mademoiselle Salomon, alarmed at the  momentary derangement of a head that was always feeble, took him back at  once to the Alouette, believing that this beginning of mental alienation  was an effect produced by the sudden news of Abbe Poirel’s nomination.  She knew nothing, of course, of the fatal agreement made by the abbe  with Mademoiselle Gamard, for the excellent reason that he did not  know of it himself; and because it is in the nature of things that the  comical is often mingled with the pathetic, the singular replies of the  poor abbe made her smile.    “Chapeloud was right,” he said; “he is a monster!”    “Who?” she asked.    “Chapeloud. He has taken all.”    “You mean Poirel?”    “No, Troubert.”    At last they reached the Alouette, where the priest’s friends gave him  such tender care that towards evening he grew calmer and was able to  give them an account of what had happened during the morning.    The phlegmatic old fox asked to see the deed which, on thinking the  matter over, seemed to him to contain the solution of the enigma.  Birotteau drew the fatal stamped paper from his pocket and gave it  to Monsieur de Bourbonne, who read it rapidly and soon came upon the  following clause:--    “Whereas a difference exists of eight hundred francs yearly between the  price of board paid by the late Abbe Chapeloud and that at which the  said Sophie Gamard agrees to take into her house, on the above-named  stipulated condition, the said Francois Birotteau; and whereas it is  understood that the undersigned Francois Birotteau is not able for  some years to pay the full price charged to the other boarders of  Mademoiselle Gamard, more especially the Abbe Troubert; the said  Birotteau does hereby engage, in consideration of certain sums of money  advanced by the undersigned Sophie Gamard, to leave her, as indemnity,  all the household property of which he may die possessed, or to transfer  the same to her should he, for any reason whatever or at any time,  voluntarily give up the apartment now leased to him, and thus derive  no further profit from the above-named engagements made by Mademoiselle  Gamard for his benefit--”    “Confound her! what an agreement!” cried the old gentleman. “The said  Sophie Gamard is armed with claws.”    Poor Birotteau never imagined in his childish brain that anything could  ever separate him from that house where he expected to live and die with  Mademoiselle Gamard. He had no remembrance whatever of that clause, the  terms of which he had not discussed, for they had seemed quite just to  him at a time when, in his great anxiety to enter the old maid’s house,  he would readily have signed any and all legal documents she had offered  him. His simplicity was so guileless and Mademoiselle Gamard’s conduct  so atrocious, the fate of the poor old man seemed so deplorable, and his  natural helplessness made him so touching, that in the first glow of  her indignation Madame de Listomere exclaimed: “I made you put your  signature to that document which has ruined you; I am bound to give you  back the happiness of which I have deprived you.”    “But,” remarked Monsieur de Bourbonne, “that deed constitutes a fraud;  there may be ground for a lawsuit.”    “Then Birotteau shall go to the law. If he loses at Tours he may win at  Orleans; if he loses at Orleans, he’ll win in Paris,” cried the Baron de  Listomere.    “But if he does go to law,” continued Monsieur de Bourbonne, coldly, “I  should advise him to resign his vicariat.”    “We will consult lawyers,” said Madame de Listomere, “and go to law if  law is best. But this affair is so disgraceful for Mademoiselle Gamard,  and is likely to be so injurious to the Abbe Troubert, that I think we  can compromise.”    After mature deliberation all present promised their assistance to the  Abbe Birotteau in the struggle which was now inevitable between the poor  priest and his antagonists and all their adherents. A true presentiment,  an infallible provincial instinct, led them to couple the names of  Gamard and Troubert. But none of the persons assembled on this occasion  in Madame de Listomere’s salon, except the old fox, had any real idea of  the nature and importance of such a struggle. Monsieur de Bourbonne took  the poor abbe aside into a corner of the room.    “Of the fourteen persons now present,” he said, in a low voice, “not  one will stand by you a fortnight hence. If the time comes when you need  some one to support you you may find that I am the only person in Tours  bold enough to take up your defence; for I know the provinces and men  and things, and, better still, I know self-interests. But these friends  of yours, though full of the best intentions, are leading you astray  into a bad path, from which you won’t be able to extricate yourself.  Take my advice; if you want to live in peace, resign the vicariat of  Saint-Gatien and leave Tours. Don’t say where you are going, but find  some distant parish where Troubert cannot get hold of you.”    “Leave Tours!” exclaimed the vicar, with indescribable terror.    To him it was a kind of death; the tearing up of all the roots by which  he held to life. Celibates substitute habits for feelings; and when to  that moral system, which makes them pass through life instead of really  living it, is added a feeble character, external things assume an  extraordinary power over them. Birotteau was like certain vegetables;  transplant them, and you stop their ripening. Just as a tree needs daily  the same sustenance, and must always send its roots into the same soil,  so Birotteau needed to trot about Saint-Gatien, and amble along the Mail  where he took his daily walk, and saunter through the streets, and visit  the three salons where, night after night, he played his whist or his  backgammon.    “Ah! I did not think of it!” replied Monsieur de Bourbonne, gazing at  the priest with a sort of pity.    All Tours was soon aware that Madame la Baronne de Listomere, widow of  a lieutenant-general, had invited the Abbe Birotteau, vicar of  Saint-Gatien, to stay at her house. That act, which many persons  questioned, presented the matter sharply and divided the town into  parties, especially after Mademoiselle Salomon spoke openly of a fraud  and a lawsuit. With the subtle vanity which is common to old maids, and  the fanatic self-love which characterizes them, Mademoiselle Gamard was  deeply wounded by the course taken by Madame de Listomere. The baroness  was a woman of high rank, elegant in her habits and ways, whose good  taste, courteous manners, and true piety could not be gainsaid.  By receiving Birotteau as her guest she gave a formal denial to all  Mademoiselle Gamard’s assertions, and indirectly censured her conduct by  maintaining the vicar’s cause against his former landlady.    It is necessary for the full understanding of this history to explain  how the natural discernment and spirit of analysis which old women bring  to bear on the actions of others gave power to Mademoiselle Gamard, and  what were the resources on her side. Accompanied by the taciturn Abbe  Troubert she made a round of evening visits to five or six houses, at  each of which she met a circle of a dozen or more persons, united by  kindred tastes and the same general situation in life. Among them were  one or two men who were influenced by the gossip and prejudices of their  servants; five or six old maids who spent their time in sifting the  words and scrutinizing the actions of their neighbours and others in the  class below them; besides these, there were several old women who  busied themselves in retailing scandal, keeping an exact account of  each person’s fortune, striving to control or influence the actions of  others, prognosticating marriages, and blaming the conduct of friends  as sharply as that of enemies. These persons, spread about the town like  the capillary fibres of a plant, sucked in, with the thirst of a leaf  for the dew, the news and the secrets of each household, and transmitted  them mechanically to the Abbe Troubert, as the leaves convey to the  branch the moisture they absorb.    Accordingly, during every evening of the week, these good devotees,  excited by that need of emotion which exists in all of us, rendered  an exact account of the current condition of the town with a sagacity  worthy of the Council of Ten, and were, in fact, a species of police,  armed with the unerring gift of spying bestowed by passions. When they  had divined the secret meaning of some event their vanity led them to  appropriate to themselves the wisdom of their sanhedrim, and set the  tone to the gossip of their respective spheres. This idle but ever busy  fraternity, invisible, yet seeing all things, dumb, but perpetually  talking, possessed an influence which its nonentity seemed to render  harmless, though it was in fact terrible in its effects when it  concerned itself with serious interests. For a long time nothing had  entered the sphere of these existences so serious and so momentous to  each one of them as the struggle of Birotteau, supported by Madame de  Listomere, against Mademoiselle Gamard and the Abbe Troubert. The three  salons of Madame de Listomere and the Demoiselles Merlin de la Blottiere  and de Villenoix being considered as enemies by all the salons which  Mademoiselle Gamard frequented, there was at the bottom of the quarrel  a class sentiment with all its jealousies. It was the old Roman  struggle of people and senate in a molehill, a tempest in a teacup, as  Montesquieu remarked when speaking of the Republic of San Marino, whose  public offices are filled by the day only,--despotic power being easily  seized by any citizen.    But this tempest, petty as it seems, did develop in the souls of these  persons as many passions as would have been called forth by the highest  social interests. It is a mistake to think that none but souls concerned  in mighty projects, which stir their lives and set them foaming, find  time too fleeting. The hours of the Abbe Troubert fled by as eagerly,  laden with thoughts as anxious, harassed by despairs and hopes as deep  as the cruellest hours of the gambler, the lover, or the statesman. God  alone is in the secret of the energy we expend upon our occult triumphs  over man, over things, over ourselves. Though we know not always  whither we are going we know well what the journey costs us. If it be  permissible for the historian to turn aside for a moment from the drama  he is narrating and ask his readers to cast a glance upon the lives of  these old maids and abbes, and seek the cause of the evil which  vitiates them at their source, we may find it demonstrated that man  must experience certain passions before he can develop within him those  virtues which give grandeur to life by widening his sphere and checking  the selfishness which is inherent in every created being.    Madame de Listomere returned to town without being aware that for the  previous week her friends had felt obliged to refute a rumour (at which  she would have laughed had she known if it) that her affection for her  nephew had an almost criminal motive. She took Birotteau to her lawyer,  who did not regard the case as an easy one. The vicar’s friends,  inspired by the belief that justice was certain in so good a cause,  or inclined to procrastinate in a matter which did not concern them  personally, had put off bringing the suit until they returned to  Tours. Consequently the friends of Mademoiselle Gamard had taken the  initiative, and told the affair wherever they could to the injury of  Birotteau. The lawyer, whose practice was exclusively among the most  devout church people, amazed Madame de Listomere by advising her not  to embark on such a suit; he ended the consultation by saying that “he  himself would not be able to undertake it, for, according to the terms  of the deed, Mademoiselle Gamard had the law on her side, and in equity,  that is to say outside of strict legal justice, the Abbe Birotteau would  undoubtedly seem to the judges as well as to all respectable laymen  to have derogated from the peaceable, conciliatory, and mild character  hitherto attributed to him; that Mademoiselle Gamard, known to be a  kindly woman and easy to live with, had put Birotteau under obligations  to her by lending him the money he needed to pay the legacy duties on  Chapeloud’s bequest without taking from him a receipt; that Birotteau  was not of an age or character to sign a deed without knowing what  it contained or understanding the importance of it; that in leaving  Mademoiselle Gamard’s house at the end of two years, when his friend  Chapeloud had lived there twelve and Troubert fifteen, he must have had  some purpose known to himself only; and that the lawsuit, if undertaken,  would strike the public as an act of ingratitude;” and so forth. Letting  Birotteau go before them to the staircase, the lawyer detained Madame de  Listomere a moment to entreat her, if she valued her own peace of mind,  not to involve herself in the matter.    But that evening the poor vicar, suffering the torments of a man under  sentence of death who awaits in the condemned cell at Bicetre the result  of his appeal for mercy, could not refrain from telling his assembled  friends the result of his visit to the lawyer.    “I don’t know a single pettifogger in Tours,” said Monsieur de  Bourbonne, “except that Radical lawyer, who would be willing to take  the case,--unless for the purpose of losing it; I don’t advise you to  undertake it.”    “Then it is infamous!” cried the navel lieutenant. “I myself will take  the abbe to the Radical--”    “Go at night,” said Monsieur de Bourbonne, interrupting him.    “Why?”    “I have just learned that the Abbe Troubert is appointed vicar-general  in place of the other man, who died yesterday.”    “I don’t care a fig for the Abbe Troubert.”    Unfortunately the Baron de Listomere (a man thirty-six years of age) did  not see the sign Monsieur de Bourbonne made him to be cautious in what  he said, motioning as he did so to a friend of Troubert, a councillor of  the Prefecture, who was present. The lieutenant therefore continued:--    “If the Abbe Troubert is a scoundrel--”    “Oh,” said Monsieur de Bourbonne, cutting him short, “why bring Monsieur  Troubert into a matter which doesn’t concern him?”    “Not concern him?” cried the baron; “isn’t he enjoying the use of the  Abbe Birotteau’s household property? I remember that when I called on  the Abbe Chapeloud I noticed two valuable pictures. Say that they are  worth ten thousand francs; do you suppose that Monsieur Birotteau  meant to give ten thousand francs for living two years with that Gamard  woman,--not to speak of the library and furniture, which are worth as  much more?”    The Abbe Birotteau opened his eyes at hearing he had once possessed so  enormous a fortune.    The baron, getting warmer than ever, went on to say: “By Jove! there’s  that Monsieur Salmon, formerly an expert at the Museum in Paris; he is  down here on a visit to his mother-in-law. I’ll go and see him this very  evening with the Abbe Birotteau and ask him to look at those pictures  and estimate their value. From there I’ll take the abbe to the lawyer.”    Two days after this conversation the suit was begun. This employment of  the Liberal laywer did harm to the vicar’s cause. Those who were opposed  to the government, and all who were known to dislike the priests, or  religion (two things quite distinct which many persons confound), got  hold of the affair and the whole town talked of it. The Museum expert  estimated the Virgin of Valentin and the Christ of Lebrun, two paintings  of great beauty, at eleven thousand francs. As to the bookshelves  and the gothic furniture, the taste for such things was increasing  so rapidly in Paris that their immediate value was at least twelve  thousand. In short, the appraisal of the whole property by the expert  reached the sum of over thirty-six thousand francs. Now it was very  evident that Birotteau never intended to give Mademoiselle Gamard such  an enormous sum of money for the small amount he might owe her under the  terms of the deed; therefore he had, legally speaking, equitable grounds  on which to demand an amendment of the agreement; if this were denied,  Mademoiselle Gamard was plainly guilty of intentional fraud. The Radical  lawyer accordingly began the affair by serving a writ on Mademoiselle  Gamard. Though very harsh in language, this document, strengthened by  citations of precedents and supported by certain clauses in the Code,  was a masterpiece of legal argument, and so evidently just in its  condemnation of the old maid that thirty or forty copies were made and  maliciously distributed through the town.          IV    A few days after this commencement of hostilities between Birotteau and  the old maid, the Baron de Listomere, who expected to be included as  captain of a corvette in a coming promotion lately announced by the  minister of the Navy, received a letter from one of his friends warning  him that there was some intention of putting him on the retired list.  Greatly astonished by this information he started for Paris immediately,  and went at once to the minister, who seemed to be amazed himself, and  even laughed at the baron’s fears. The next day, however, in spite of  the minister’s assurance, Monsieur de Listomere made inquiries in the  different offices. By an indiscretion (often practised by heads of  departments in favor of their friends) one of the secretaries showed  him a document confirming the fatal news, which was only waiting the  signature of the director, who was ill, to be submitted to the minister.    The Baron de Listomere went immediately to an uncle of his, a deputy,  who could see the minister of the Navy at the chamber without loss of  time, and begged him to find out the real intentions of his Excellency  in a matter which threatened the loss of his whole future. He waited in  his uncle’s carriage with the utmost anxiety for the end of the session.  His uncle came out before the Chamber rose, and said to him at once as  they drove away: “Why the devil have you meddled in a priest’s quarrel?  The minister began by telling me you had put yourself at the head of the  Radicals in Tours; that your political opinions were objectionable; you  were not following in the lines of the government,--with other remarks  as much involved as if he were addressing the Chamber. On that I said  to him, ‘Nonsense; let us come to the point.’ The end was that his  Excellency told me frankly you were in bad odor with the diocese. In  short, I made a few inquiries among my colleagues, and I find that  you have been talking slightingly of a certain Abbe Troubert, the  vicar-general, but a very important personage in the province, where he  represents the Jesuits. I have made myself responsible to the minister  for your future conduct. My good nephew, if you want to make your way be  careful not to excite ecclesiastical enmities. Go at once to Tours and  try to make your peace with that devil of a vicar-general; remember that  such priests are men with whom we absolutely _must_ live in harmony.  Good heavens! when we are all striving and working to re-establish  religion it is actually stupid, in a lieutenant who wants to be made a  captain, to affront the priests. If you don’t make up matters with that  Abbe Troubert you needn’t count on me; I shall abandon you. The minister  of ecclesiastical affairs told me just now that Troubert was certain to  be made bishop before long; if he takes a dislike to our family he could  hinder me from being included in the next batch of peers. Don’t you  understand?”    These words explained to the naval officer the nature of Troubert’s  secret occupations, about which Birotteau often remarked in his silly  way: “I can’t think what he does with himself,--sitting up all night.”    The canon’s position in the midst of his female senate, converted so  adroitly into provincial detectives, and his personal capacity,  had induced the Congregation of Jesus to select him out of all the  ecclesiastics in the town, as the secret proconsul of Touraine.  Archbishop, general, prefect, all men, great and small, were under his  occult dominion. The Baron de Listomere decided at once on his course.    “I shall take care,” he said to his uncle, “not to get another round  shot below my water-line.”    Three days after this diplomatic conference between the uncle and  nephew, the latter, returning hurriedly in a post-chaise, informed his  aunt, the very night of his arrival, of the dangers the family were  running if they persisted in supporting that “fool of a Birotteau.” The  baron had detained Monsieur de Bourbonne as the old gentleman was taking  his hat and cane after the usual rubber of whist. The clear-sightedness  of that sly old fox seemed indispensable for an understanding of the  reefs among which the Listomere family suddenly found themselves; and  perhaps the action of taking his hat and cane was only a ruse to have it  whispered in his ear: “Stay after the others; we want to talk to you.”    The baron’s sudden return, his apparent satisfaction, which was quite  out of keeping with a harassed look that occasionally crossed his face,  informed Monsieur de Bourbonne vaguely that the lieutenant had met with  some check in his crusade against Gamard and Troubert. He showed  no surprise when the baron revealed the secret power of the Jesuit  vicar-general.    “I knew that,” he said.    “Then why,” cried the baroness, “did you not warn us?”    “Madame,” he said, sharply, “forget that I was aware of the invisible  influence of that priest, and I will forget that you knew it equally  well. If we do not keep this secret now we shall be thought his  accomplices, and shall be more feared and hated than we are. Do as I do;  pretend to be duped; but look carefully where you set your feet. I did  warn you sufficiently, but you would not understand me, and I did not  choose to compromise myself.”    “What must we do now?” said the baron.    The abandonment of Birotteau was not even made a question; it was a  first condition tacitly accepted by the three deliberators.    “To beat a retreat with the honors of war has always been the triumph of  the ablest generals,” replied Monsieur de Bourbonne. “Bow to Troubert,  and if his hatred is less strong than his vanity you will make him your  ally; but if you bow too low he will walk over you rough-shod; make  believe that you intend to leave the service, and you’ll escape him,  Monsieur le baron. Send away Birotteau, madame, and you will set things  right with Mademoiselle Gamard. Ask the Abbe Troubert, when you meet him  at the archbishop’s, if he can play whist. He will say yes. Then invite  him to your salon, where he wants to be received; he’ll be sure to come.  You are a woman, and you can certainly win a priest to your interests.  When the baron is promoted, his uncle peer of France, and Troubert  a bishop, you can make Birotteau a canon if you choose. Meantime  yield,--but yield gracefully, all the while with a slight menace. Your  family can give Troubert quite as much support as he can give you.  You’ll understand each other perfectly on that score. As for you,  sailor, carry your deep-sea line about you.”    “Poor Birotteau?” said the baroness.    “Oh, get rid of him at once,” replied the old man, as he rose to take  leave. “If some clever Radical lays hold of that empty head of his, he  may cause you much trouble. After all, the court would certainly give a  verdict in his favour, and Troubert must fear that. He may forgive  you for beginning the struggle, but if they were defeated he would be  implacable. I have said my say.”    He snapped his snuff-box, put on his overshoes, and departed.    The next day after breakfast the baroness took the vicar aside and said  to him, not without visible embarrassment:--    “My dear Monsieur Birotteau, you will think what I am about to ask of  you very unjust and very inconsistent; but it is necessary, both for you  and for us, that your lawsuit with Mademoiselle Gamard be withdrawn by  resigning your claims, and also that you should leave my house.”    As he heard these words the poor abbe turned pale.    “I am,” she continued, “the innocent cause of your misfortunes, and,  moreover, if it had not been for my nephew you would never have begun  this lawsuit, which has now turned to your injury and to ours. But  listen to me.”    She told him succinctly the immense ramifications of the affair, and  explained the serious nature of its consequences. Her own meditations  during the night had told her something of the probable antecedents of  Troubert’s life; she was able, without misleading Birotteau, to show  him the net so ably woven round him by revenge, and to make him see the  power and great capacity of his enemy, whose hatred to Chapeloud, under  whom he had been forced to crouch for a dozen years, now found vent in  seizing Chapeloud’s property and in persecuting Chapeloud in the person  of his friend. The harmless Birotteau clasped his hands as if to pray,  and wept with distress at the sight of human horrors that his own  pure soul was incapable of suspecting. As frightened as though he had  suddenly found himself at the edge of a precipice, he listened, with  fixed, moist eyes in which there was no expression, to the revelations  of his friend, who ended by saying: “I know the wrong I do in abandoning  your cause; but, my dear abbe, family duties must be considered before  those of friendship. Yield, as I do, to this storm, and I will prove to  you my gratitude. I am not talking of your worldly interests, for those  I take charge of. You shall be made free of all such anxieties for the  rest of your life. By means of Monsieur de Bourbonne, who will know  how to save appearances, I shall arrange matters so that you shall lack  nothing. My friend, grant me the right to abandon you. I shall ever be  your friend, though forced to conform to the axioms of the world. You  must decide.”    The poor, bewildered abbe cried aloud: “Chapeloud was right when he said  that if Troubert could drag him by the feet out of his grave he would do  it! He sleeps in Chapeloud’s bed!”    “There is no use in lamenting,” said Madame de Listomere, “and we have  little time now left to us. How will you decide?”    Birotteau was too good and kind not to obey in a great crisis the  unreflecting impulse of the moment. Besides, his life was already in the  agony of what to him was death. He said, with a despairing look at his  protectress which cut her to the heart, “I trust myself to you--I am but  the stubble of the streets.”    He used the Tourainean word “bourrier” which has no other meaning than  a “bit of straw.” But there are pretty little straws, yellow, polished,  and shining, the delight of children, whereas the bourrier is straw  discolored, muddy, sodden in the puddles, whirled by the tempest,  crushed under feet of men.    “But, madame, I cannot let the Abbe Troubert keep Chapeloud’s portrait.  It was painted for me, it belongs to me; obtain that for me, and I will  give up all the rest.”    “Well,” said Madame de Listomere. “I will go myself to Mademoiselle  Gamard.” The words were said in a tone which plainly showed the immense  effort the Baronne de Listomere was making in lowering herself to  flatter the pride of the old maid. “I will see what can be done,”   she said; “I hardly dare hope anything. Go and consult Monsieur de  Bourbonne; ask him to put your renunciation into proper form, and bring  me the paper. I will see the archbishop, and with his help we may be  able to stop the matter here.”    Birotteau left the house dismayed. Troubert assumed in his eyes the  dimensions of an Egyptian pyramid. The hands of that man were in Paris,  his elbows in the Cloister of Saint-Gatien.    “He!” said the victim to himself, “_He_ to prevent the Baron de  Listomere from becoming peer of France!--and, perhaps, ‘by the help of  the archbishop we may be able to stop the matter here’!”    In presence of such great interests Birotteau felt he was a mere worm;  he judged himself harshly.    The news of Birotteau’s removal from Madame de Listomere’s house seemed  all the more amazing because the reason of it was wholly impenetrable.  Madame de Listomere said that her nephew was intending to marry and  leave the navy, and she wanted the vicar’s apartment to enlarge her own.  Birotteau’s relinquishment was still unknown. The advice of Monsieur de  Bourbonne was followed. Whenever the two facts reached the ears of the  vicar-general his self-love was certain to be gratified by the assurance  they gave that even if the Listomere family did not capitulate they  would at least remain neutral and tacitly recognize the occult power of  the Congregation,--to recognize it was, in fact, to submit to it. But the  lawsuit was still sub-judice; his opponents yielded and threatened at  the same time.    The Listomeres had thus taken precisely the same attitude as the  vicar-general himself; they held themselves aloof, and yet were able  to direct others. But just at this crisis an event occurred which  complicated the plans laid by Monsieur de Bourbonne and the Listomeres  to quiet the Gamard and Troubert party, and made them more difficult to  carry out.    Mademoiselle Gamard took cold one evening in coming out of the  cathedral; the next day she was confined to her bed, and soon after  became dangerously ill. The whole town rang with pity and false  commiseration: “Mademoiselle Gamard’s sensitive nature has not been  able to bear the scandal of this lawsuit. In spite of the justice of  her cause she was likely to die of grief. Birotteau has killed his  benefactress.” Such were the speeches poured through the capillary tubes  of the great female conclave, and taken up and repeated by the whole  town of Tours.    Madame de Listomere went the day after Mademoiselle Gamard took cold  to pay the promised visit, and she had the mortification of that act  without obtaining any benefit from it, for the old maid was too ill to  see her. She then asked politely to speak to the vicar-general.    Gratified, no doubt, to receive in Chapeloud’s library, at the corner of  the fireplace above which hung the two contested pictures, the woman  who had hitherto ignored him, Troubert kept the baroness waiting a moment  before he consented to admit her. No courtier and no diplomatist ever  put into a discussion of their personal interests or into the management  of some great national negotiation more shrewdness, dissimulation, and  ability than the baroness and the priest displayed when they met face to  face for the struggle.    Like the seconds or sponsors who in the Middle Age armed the champion,  and strengthened his valor by useful counsel until he entered the lists,  so the sly old fox had said to the baroness at the last moment: “Don’t  forget your cue. You are a mediator, and not an interested party.  Troubert also is a mediator. Weigh your words; study the inflection of  the man’s voice. If he strokes his chin you have got him.”    Some sketchers are fond of caricaturing the contrast often observable  between “what is said” and “what is thought” by the speaker. To catch  the full meaning of the duel of words which now took place between the  priest and the lady, it is necessary to unveil the thoughts that each  hid from the other under spoken sentences of apparent insignificance.  Madame de Listomere began by expressing the regret she had felt at  Birotteau’s lawsuit; and then went on to speak of her desire to settle  the matter to the satisfaction of both parties.    “The harm is done, madame,” said the priest, in a grave voice. “The  pious and excellent Mademoiselle Gamard is dying.” (“I don’t care a fig  for the old thing,” thought he, “but I mean to put her death on your  shoulders and harass your conscience if you are such a fool as to listen  to it.”)    “On hearing of her illness,” replied the baroness, “I entreated Monsieur  Birotteau to relinquish his claims; I have brought the document,  intending to give it to that excellent woman.” (“I see what you mean,  you wily scoundrel,” thought she, “but we are safe now from your  calumnies. If you take this document you’ll cut your own fingers by  admitting you are an accomplice.”)    There was silence for a moment.    “Mademoiselle Gamard’s temporal affairs do not concern me,” said the  priest at last, lowering the large lids over his eagle eyes to veil his  emotions. (“Ho! ho!” thought he, “you can’t compromise me. Thank God,  those damned lawyers won’t dare to plead any cause that could smirch me.  What do these Listomeres expect to get by crouching in this way?”)    “Monsieur,” replied the baroness, “Monsieur Birotteau’s affairs are  no more mine than those of Mademoiselle Gamard are yours; but,  unfortunately, religion is injured by such a quarrel, and I come to you  as a mediator--just as I myself am seeking to make peace.” (“We are not  deceiving each other, Monsieur Troubert,” thought she. “Don’t you feel  the sarcasm of that answer?”)    “Injury to religion, madame!” exclaimed the vicar-general. “Religion  is too lofty for the actions of men to injure.” (“My religion is I,”   thought he.) “God makes no mistake in His judgments, madame; I recognize  no tribunal but His.”    “Then, monsieur,” she replied, “let us endeavor to bring the judgments  of men into harmony with the judgments of God.” (“Yes, indeed, your  religion is you.”)    The Abbe Troubert suddenly changed his tone.    “Your nephew has been to Paris, I believe.” (“You found out about me  there,” thought he; “you know now that I can crush you, you who dared to  slight me, and you have come to capitulate.”)    “Yes, monsieur; thank you for the interest you take in him. He returns  to-night; the minister, who is very considerate of us, sent for him; he  does not want Monsieur de Listomere to leave the service.” (“Jesuit, you  can’t crush us,” thought she. “I understand your civility.”)    A moment’s silence.    “I did not think my nephew’s conduct in this affair quite the thing,”   she added; “but naval men must be excused; they know nothing of law.”   (“Come, we had better make peace,” thought she; “we sha’n’t gain  anything by battling in this way.”)    A slight smile wandered over the priests face and was lost in its  wrinkles.    “He has done us the service of getting a proper estimate on the value of  those paintings,” he said, looking up at the pictures. “They will be  a noble ornament to the chapel of the Virgin.” (“You shot a sarcasm at  me,” thought he, “and there’s another in return; we are quits, madame.”)    “If you intend to give them to Saint-Gatien, allow me to offer frames  that will be more suitable and worthy of the place, and of the works  themselves.” (“I wish I could force you to betray that you have taken  Birotteau’s things for your own,” thought she.)    “They do not belong to me,” said the priest, on his guard.    “Here is the deed of relinquishment,” said Madame de Listomere; “it ends  all discussion, and makes them over to Mademoiselle Gamard.” She laid  the document on the table. (“See the confidence I place in you,” thought  she.) “It is worthy of you, monsieur,” she added, “worthy of your noble  character, to reconcile two Christians,--though at present I am not  especially concerned for Monsieur Birotteau--”    “He is living in your house,” said Troubert, interrupting her.    “No, monsieur, he is no longer there.” (“That peerage and my nephew’s  promotion force me to do base things,” thought she.)    The priest remained impassible, but his calm exterior was an indication  of violent emotion. Monsieur Bourbonne alone had fathomed the secret of  that apparent tranquillity. The priest had triumphed!    “Why did you take upon yourself to bring that relinquishment,” he  asked, with a feeling analogous to that which impels a woman to fish for  compliments.    “I could not avoid a feeling of compassion. Birotteau, whose feeble  nature must be well known to you, entreated me to see Madaemoiselle  Gamard and to obtain as the price of his renunciation--”    The priest frowned.    “of rights upheld by distinguished lawyers, the portrait of--”    Troubert looked fixedly at Madame de Listomere.    “the portrait of Chapeloud,” she said, continuing: “I leave you to judge  of his claim.” (“You will be certain to lose your case if we go to law,  and you know it,” thought she.)    The tone of her voice as she said the words “distinguished lawyers”   showed the priest that she knew very well both the strength and weakness  of the enemy. She made her talent so plain to this connoisseur emeritus  in the course of a conversation which lasted a long time in the tone  here given, that Troubert finally went down to Mademoiselle Gamard to  obtain her answer to Birotteau’s request for the portrait.    He soon returned.    “Madame,” he said, “I bring you the words of a dying woman. ‘The Abbe  Chapeloud was so true a friend to me,’ she said, ‘that I cannot consent  to part with his picture.’ As for me,” added Troubert, “if it were mine  I would not yield it. My feelings to my late friend were so faithful  that I should feel my right to his portrait was above that of others.”    “Well, there’s no need to quarrel over a bad picture.” (“I care as  little about it as you do,” thought she.) “Keep it, and I will have a  copy made of it. I take some credit to myself for having averted this  deplorable lawsuit; and I have gained, personally, the pleasure of your  acquaintance. I hear you have a great talent for whist. You will forgive  a woman for curiosity,” she said, smiling. “If you will come and play at  my house sometimes you cannot doubt your welcome.”    Troubert stroked his chin. (“Caught! Bourbonne was right!” thought she;  “he has his quantum of vanity!”)    It was true. The vicar-general was feeling the delightful sensation  which Mirabeau was unable to subdue when in the days of his power he  found gates opening to his carriage which were barred to him in earlier  days.    “Madame,” he replied, “my avocations prevent my going much into society;  but for you, what will not a man do?” (“The old maid is going to die;  I’ll get a footing at the Listomere’s, and serve them if they serve me,”   thought he. “It is better to have them for friends than enemies.”)    Madame de Listomere went home, hoping that the archbishop would complete  the work of peace so auspiciously begun. But Birotteau was fated to gain  nothing by his relinquishment. Mademoiselle Gamard died the next day.  No one felt surprised when her will was opened to find that she had  left everything to the Abbe Troubert. Her fortune was appraised at three  hundred thousand francs. The vicar-general sent to Madame de Listomere  two notes of invitation for the services and for the funeral procession  of his friend; one for herself and one for her nephew.    “We must go,” she said.    “It can’t be helped,” said Monsieur de Bourbonne. “It is a test to  which Troubert puts you. Baron, you must go to the cemetery,” he added,  turning to the lieutenant, who, unluckily for him, had not left Tours.    The services took place, and were performed with unusual ecclesiastical  magnificence. Only one person wept, and that was Birotteau, who,  kneeling in a side chapel and seen by none, believed himself guilty of  the death and prayed sincerely for the soul of the deceased, bitterly  deploring that he was not able to obtain her forgiveness before she  died.    The Abbe Troubert followed the body of his friend to the grave; at  the verge of which he delivered a discourse in which, thanks to his  eloquence, the narrow life the old maid had lived was enlarged to  monumental proportions. Those present took particular note of the  following words in the peroration:--    “This life of days devoted to God and to His religion, a life adorned  with noble actions silently performed, and with modest and hidden  virtues, was crushed by a sorrow which we might call undeserved if we  could forget, here at the verge of this grave, that our afflictions are  sent by God. The numerous friends of this saintly woman, knowing the  innocence and nobility of her soul, foresaw that ",29.39,14.9,21.5,10.29,25.8,7.84,1050,15.5,24.31,21st and 22nd grade
28,"""A Masters Degreer""","college culture is surely worth the cost.    Elinor leaned forward, eagerly.    “Tell me about your father,” she said.    “My father lost his life because he dared to tell the truth,” Victor  replied.    “Oh, glorious!” Elinor cried, earnestly.    “I have always loved my father's memory for his courage,” Victor  continued. “He was a believer in law enforcement and he was a terror  to the bootleggers who carried whisky into our settlement. A man named  Gresh was notorious for selling whisky to the claim holders. He gave it,  Elinor, gave it, to a boy, a widow's son, made him drunk, robbed him,  and left him to freeze to death in a blizzard. The boy lived long enough  to tell my father who did it, and it was his testimony that helped to  convict Gresh and start him to the penitentiary. He escaped from the  sheriff on the way--and, so far as I know, there's one bad man still at  large, a fugitive before the law. Whisky is the devil's own best tool,  whether a man drinks it himself or gets other people to drink it.”    “That's a bad name,” Elinor said. “My grandfather adopted a boy named  Gresh, who turned out bad. I think he was killed in a saloon row in  Chicago. Did this Gresh ever trouble you again?”    Burleigh's face was grim as he answered:    “My father was waylaid and murdered with a club by this man. He escaped  afterward into Indian Territory. He left his own name, Gresh, scrawled  on a piece of paper pinned to my father's coat to show whose revenge  was worked out. He was a volcano of human hate--that man Gresh. After  my father's name was written--'The same club for every Burleigh who ever  crosses my path.' I expect to cross his path some day, and if I ever lay  my eyes on that fiend it will go hard with one of us.” The yellow  glow burned again in Victor Burleigh's eyes and his fists clinched  involuntarily. They were silent a while, until the sweetness of the  day and the joy of being together wooed them to happier thoughts. Then  Elinor remembered her disordered hair and, throwing aside her hat, she  deftly put it into place.    “Am I presentable for the supper at the Kickapoo Corral?” she asked, as  she picked up her hat again.    “You suit me,” Burleigh replied. “What are the Kickapoo requirements?”    “That Victor Burleigh shall be satisfied,” she answered, roguishly.  “Really, that's right. Four girls offered to substitute for me in this  penitential pilgrimage and write some long translations for me beside.”    “Four, individually or collectively?” he asked.    “Either way,” she answered.    “Why did n't you let them do it?    “Which way?”    “Either way,” he replied.    “Would you rather have had the four either way, than me?” she  questioned, with pretty vanity.    “Much rather.” His voice was stern.    “Why?” She was stung by the answer.    The glen was all a dreamy gray-green ruggedness of shelving rock with  mossy crevices and ferny nooks. The sunlight filtering through the  young leaves fell about them in a shadow-flecked softness. There was a  crooning song of some bird on its nest, the murmur of waters rippling  down the stony shallows, and a beautiful girl in a dainty pink dress  with her fingers just touching her fluffy masses of hair.    “Why?”    With the question Elinor looked up and saw why. Saw in Victor Burleigh's  golden-brown eyes a look she had never read in eyes before; saw the  whole face, the rugged, manly face lighted with a man's overmastering  love. And the joy of it thrilled her soul.    “Do you know why?”    He leaned toward her ever so little. And Elinor Wream, forgetful of  the Wream family rank, forgetful of her tacit consent to Uncle Joshua's  wishes, forgetful of Vincent Burgess and his heritage of culture,  beautiful Elinor Wream, with her starry eyes, and cheeks of  peach-blossom pink, put out her hands to Victor Burleigh, who took them  eagerly.    “Let me hold them a minute,” he said, softly. “There are sixty years to  remember, but only one hour like this.”    Then, forgetful of the world and the demands of the world, keeping her  hands in his, he bent and kissed her, as from the foundation of the  world it was his right to do. And Love's Young Dream, not bought  with pain, as mother love is bought, nor wrought out with prayer and  sacrificial service, as love for all humanity is won, came again on this  April day to the little, rock-sheltered glen beside the bright waters  of the Walnut, and briefly there rebuilt in rainbow hues the old, old  paradise of joy for these two alone.    And into the new Eden came the new serpent also for to destroy. Before  Elinor and Victor was the sunlit valley. Behind them was the cave's  mouth with its shadowy gloom deepening back to dense darkness. And  creeping stealthily through that blackness, like a serpent warming its  venom and writhing slowly toward the light, a human form was slowly,  stealthily crawling outward, with head upreared and cruel eyes alert.  The brutal face was void of pity, as if the conscience behind it had  long been bound and gagged to human sympathy.    While Burleigh was speaking the caveman had reached the doorway and  reared up just beside it in the shadow. Clutching a brutal-looking club  in his hairy, rough hand, he stood listening to the story of the murder  that had left Victor fatherless. The face of the listener made clear the  need for guardian angels. One leap, one blow, and Victor Burleigh would  carry only one more scar to his grave.    Suddenly a faint piping voice floated in upon the glen:     Little childwen pwessing near       To the feet of Thwist, the Ting,   Have you neiver doubt nor fear       Or some twibute do you bwing?      And Bug Buler, flushed and splashed, and generally muddy and happy, came  around the fallen ledges and debauched into the grassy sunshiny space  before the cavern. Only a tiny, tumbled-up, joyous child, with no power  in his pudgy little arm; and Victor Burleigh, tall, muscular and agile.  Against this man of tremendous strength the caveman's club was lifted.  But with the sound of the child's voice and the sight of the innocent  face the club fell harmless. A look of fright, deepening to a maniac's  terror, seized the creature, and noiselessly and swiftly as a serpent  would escape he crawled back into the darkness and burrowed deep from  the eyes of men. So strength that day was ruled by weakness.    “I ist followed you, Vic,” Bug said, clutching Vic's hand.    “This is n't a safe place to come, Bug. You must n't follow me here.”    “Nen you must n't go into is n't safe places, so I won't follow. Little  folks don't know,” Bug said, with cunning gravity.    “He is right,” Elinor said. “I think we'd better leave now.”    They knew that henceforth this spot would be holy ground for them, but  they did not dare to think further than that. They only wished that the  moments would stay, that the sun would loiter slowly down the afternoon  sky.    “I know a way out,” Bug declared. Turn, “I'll show you.”    Then, with a child's sense of direction, he led away from the cave out  to where the deep ravine headed in a rough mass of broken rock.    “Tlimb up that and you're out,” Bug declared.    They climbed up to the high level prairie that sweeps westward from the  Walnut bluffs.    “Doodby, folks. I want to Botany wiv urn over there. I turn wiv Limpy  out here.”    Bug pointed to a group of students wandering about in search of dogtooth  violets and other botanical plunder from Nature's springtime treasury.  Among the group was Bug's chum, the crippled student.    “Well, stay with them this time, you little wandering Jew,” Vic  admonished, nor dreamed how his guardian angel had come to him this day  in the guise of this same little wanderer.    When Victor and Elinor had come at last to the west bluff above the  Walnut River, the late afternoon was already casting long shadows across  the grassy level of the old Kickapoo Corral. And again the camp fires  were glowing where a Sorority “spread” was merrily in the making.    They must go down soon and join in the hilarity. But a golden half hour  yet hung in the west--and the going down meant the going back to all  that had been.    “Look at the foam on the whirlpool, Elinor. See how deliberately it  swings upstream. Isn't that a most deceiving bit of treachery?” Vic said  as he watched the river.    Elinor looked thoughtfully at the slow-moving water.    “I cannot endure deceit,” she said at last. “I like honesty in  everything. I said I would tell you sometime about a sacrifice I was  forced to make. I'll tell you now if you will not speak of what I say.”    How delicious to have her confidence in anything. Vic smiled assent.    “My father had a fortune from my mother. When he died he left me to  the care of my two uncles, and gave all his money to endow chairs in  universities. He thought a woman could marry money, and that he was  doing mankind a service in this endowment. Maybe he was, but I've always  rebelled against being dependent. I've always wanted my own. Uncle  Joshua thinks I am frivolous, and he has told Uncle Lloyd that it's just  my love of spending and extravagant notions that makes me rebel against  conditions. It is n't. It's the sense of being robbed, as it were. It  was n't right and honest toward me, even in a great cause, to leave  me dependent. Uncle Lloyd would never have done it. I hope he does n't  think I'm as bad as Uncle Joshua does. You won't mind my telling you  this, nor think me ungrateful to my relatives for their care of me.  Nobody quite understands me but you.”    The time had come for them to join the jolly picnic crowd in the  Corral. She would go back to Vincent Burgess in a little while, and this  glorious day would be only a memory. And yet, down in the pretty glen,  Victor had held her hands and kissed her red lips. And she had been  glad down there. The void in his life seemed blacker than the blackness  behind the cavern.    “Elinor,” he asked, suddenly, “are you bound by any promise--has  Professor Burgess--?” He hesitated.    “No,” she answered, turning her face away.    “Pardon my rudeness. You know I am not well-bred,” he said, gently.    “Victor Burleigh, you ill-bred, of all the gentle, manly fellows in  Sunrise! You know you are not.”    A great hope leaped to life now, as Vic recalled the query, “If Victor  Burleigh had his corners knocked off and was sandpapered down and  had money?”--and of Elinor's blushing confession that it would make a  difference she could not help if these things were. The corners were  knocked off now, and Dean Fenneben had gently but persistently applied  the sandpaper. The money must be henceforth the one condition.    “Elinor.” Vic's voice was sweet as low bars of music.    “Oh, Victor, there's something I can't prevent.”    She was thinking of Uncle Joshua, whose money had supported her all  these years and of her obligation to heed his wishes. It was all settled  for her now. And all the while Victor was thinking of his own limited  means as the rock that was wrecking him with her.    For all his life afterward he never forgot the sorrow of that moment. He  looked into Elinor's face, and all the longing, all the heart-hunger  of the days gone by, and of the days to come seemed to lie in those  wide-open eyes shaded by long black lashes.    “Elinor, my father's cruel murder and my mother dying alone were one  kind of grief. My fight with those deadly poison things to rescue little  Bug was another kind. My days of hardship and poverty on the claim, with  only Bug and me in that desolate loneliness, was still another. But none  of these seem a sorrow beside what I must face henceforth. And yet I  have one joy mine now. You did care down in the glen. May I keep that  one gracious joy--mine always?”    “You have always won in every game. You will in this struggle. Don't  forget the name your mother gave you.” Her eyes were luminous with  tears. “We must go down to the Corral now. Tomorrow will make things all  right. I shall be proud of you and your success everywhere, for you will  succeed.”    “I may not be worthy of victory,” he said, sadly.    “You have never been unworthy. Don't be now.” She smiled bravely.    They turned from the west prairie and the sunset, and slowly they passed  out of its passing radiance down to the darkening spaces of the old  Kickapoo Corral.    And the day with its gladness and sorrow, whether for loss or gain,  slipped into the shadowy beauty of an April twilight.        CHAPTER IX. GAIN, OR LOSS?     _Ye know how hard an Idol dies, an' what that meant       to me--E'en take it for a sacrifice, acceptable to Thee_.                                --KIPLING  THE ball game on Friday, the thirteenth, was a great event this year.  The Sunrise football eleven had held the championship record with an  uncrossed goal line in the autumn. The basket-ball team had had no  defeat this year. Debating tests had given Sunrise the victory. That  came through Trench and the crippled student. And the state oratorical  struggle repeated the story, a conquest, all the greater because Victor  Burleigh, the athlete, wore also the laurels of oratory. And why should  he not, with that fine presence and magnificent voice? As Dr. Fenneben  listened to his forceful logic he saw clearly the line for the boy's  future, a line, he thought, that could end at last only in the pulpit.    One more battle to fight now and Lagonda Ledge and the whole Walnut  Valley would go down in history as famous soil. It was a banner year for  Sunrise, and enthusiasm was at fever pitch, which in college is the only  healthy temperature. In this last battle Sunrise turned again to Victor  Burleigh as its highest hope. Although this was his first game for the  season, he had never failed to bring victory to the Sunrise banners, and  in all his base-ball practice he was as unerring as he was speedy. And  then success was his habit anyhow. So “Burleigh at the bat” was the  slogan now from the summit of the college ridge to the farthest corners  of Lagonda Ledge; and idol worship were insignificant compared to the  adulation poured out on him. And Burleigh, being young and very human,  had all the pleasure the adoration of a community can bring to its local  hero. For truly, few triumphs in life's later years can be fraught with  half the keen joy these school day victories bring. And the applause of  listening senates means less than good old comrades' yells.    Vincent Burgess, A.B., Greek Professor from Boston, seemed to have  forgotten entirely about types and geographical breadths and seclusion  for profound research amid barren prairies. He was faculty member on the  Athletic board now and enthusiastic about all college sports. Sunrise  had done this much for him anyhow. In addition, the young educator was  taking on a little roundness, suggestive of a stout form in middle life.    But Vincent Burgess had not forgotten all of the motives that had  pulled him Kansas-ward, although unknown to Dr. Fenneben, he had already  refused to consider a position higher up in an eastern college. He was  not quite ready to leave the West yet. Of course, not. Elinor Wream was  only half through school and growing more popular as she was growing  more womanly and more beautiful each year. His salvation lay in keeping  on the grounds if he would hold his claim undisturbed.    Burgess had come to Kansas, he had told Fenneben, in order to know  something of the state where his only sister had lived. He did not know  yet all he wished to know about her life and death here. Her name was  never spoken in his father's presence after she came West, so great was  that father's anger over her leaving the East. And deep in Vincent's  mind he fixed the impression that his daughter had died as unreconciled  to her brother as to her father himself.    This was all his own business, however, and hidden deep, almost out of  sight of himself, was a selfish motive that had not yet put a visible  mark on the surface.    Burgess wanted to marry Norrie Wream, and he wanted her to have all the  good things of life which in her simple rearing had been denied her.  The heritage from his father's estate included certain trust funds  ambiguously bestowed by an eccentric English ancestor upon someone who  had come West not long before his death. These funds Vincent held by his  father's will--to which will Joshua Wream was witness--on condition that  no heir to these funds was living. If there were such person or persons  living--but Burgess knew there were none. Joshua Wream had made sure of  that for him before he left Cambridge. And yet it might be well to  stay in Kansas for a year or two--much better to settle any possible  difficulty here than to have anything follow him East later. For Burgess  had his eye on Dr. Wream's chair in Harvard when the old man should  give it up. That was a part of the contract between the two men, the old  doctor and the young professor. Until the night when Bond Saxon forced  him to take an unwilling oath, Burgess had had a comfortable conscience,  sure that his financial future was settled, and confident that this  assured him the hand of Elinor Wream when the time was ripe. With that  October night, however, a weight of anxiety began that increased with  the passing days. For as he grew nearer to the student life and took on  flesh and good will and a broader knowledge of the worth of humanity, so  he grew nearer to this smoothly hidden inner care. And, outside and in,  he wanted to stay in Kansas for the time.    In the weeks before the big ball game, Victor Burleigh seemed to have  forgotten the glen and the west bluff above the Kickapoo Corral. The  girls who would have substituted for Elinor in the afternoon ramble took  up much of the big sophomore's time, and he never seemed more gay nor  care free. And Elinor, if she had a heartache, did not show it in her  happy manner.    On the afternoon before the ball game, a May thunderstorm swept the  Walnut Valley and the darkness fell early. As Dennie Saxon waited on  the Sunrise portico before starting out in the rain, Professor Burgess  locked the front door and joined her. Victor Burleigh was also waiting  beside a stone column for the shower to lighten. Burgess did not see  him in the darkening twilight and Burleigh never spoke to the young  instructor when it was not necessary.    “I must be nervous,” Professor Burgess said, trying to manage Dennie's  umbrella and catching it in her hair. “I had a letter today that worried  me.”    “Too bad!” Dennie said sympathetically.    “I'll tell you all about it sometime.”    He was trying to loose the wire rib-joint from Dennie's hair, which  the dampness was rolling in soft little ringlets about her forehead and  neck. Half-consciously, he remembered the same outline of rippling  hair, as it had looked in the glow of the October camp fire down in the  Kickapoo Corral when she was telling the old legend of Swift Elk and The  Fawn of the Morning Light. She smiled up at him consolingly. Dennie was  level-headed, and life was always worth living where she was.    “I'll be your rain beau.” He took her arm to assist her down the steps.    So courteous was his action, she might have been a lady of rank instead  of old Bond Saxon's daughter carrying her own weight of a sorrow greater  than Lagonda Ledge dreamed of. As the two walked slowly homeward under  the dripping shelter of the trees, Vincent Burgess felt a sense of  comfort and pleasure out of all keeping for a man in love elsewhere.  Victor Burleigh watched them from the shadow of the portico column.    “I believe Trench is right. He insists that Burgess likes Dennie, or  that he is mean enough to deceive Dennie into liking him. A man like  that ought to be killed--a scholar, and a rich man, and Dennie such a  brave little poor girl with a kind, weak-kneed, old father on her heart.  Norrie ought to know this, but who am I to say a word?”    “Victor Burleigh, won't you release the fair princess from the tower?” a  girl's voice called.    Vic turned to see Elinor framed in the half-way window of the south  turret. And in that dripping shadowy light, no frame could want a rarer  picture.    “I've fallen into the pit and am far on the road to perdition,” Elinor  said. “I hurried down this way from choir practice and Uncle Lloyd's  gone and left the lower door locked. It thundered so, and Dennie didn't  come into the study, and nobody heard my screams. But if I perish, I  perish,” she added with mock resignation.    “If you'll let up on perishing for half a minute, Rapunzel, I'll to  the rescue,” Vic cried, “if I have to climb the dome and knock the _per  aspera_ out of the State Seal and come down through the hole, _per astra  ad aspera_.” And then he rushed off to find an unlocked exit to the  building.    From the Chapel end of the circular stairs, he called presently.    “Curfew must not ring for a couple of seconds. Rise to the surface, fair  mermaid.”    Elinor came up the winding stair into the dimly lighted chapel at his  call. The two had avoided each other since the April day in the glen.  They were not to blame for this chance meeting now.    “When you are in trouble and the nights are dark and rainy, call me,  Elinor,” Vic said as they were crossing the rotunda.    “If I show you sometimes how to look up and find the light, as you  showed me the Sunrise beacon on the night of the storm out on West  Bluff, you may be glad you heard me. See that glow on the dome! You  would have missed that down in Lagonda Ledge.”    A level ray from a momentary cloudrift in the western sky smote the  stained glass of the dome, lighting its gleaming inscription with a  fleeting radiance.    “But the light comes rarely and is so far away, and between times, only  the cave, and the dark ways behind it leading to the river,” he said  gravely. The sorrow of hopelessness was his tone.    “Not unless one chooses to burrow downward,” she replied softly. “Let's  hurry home. Tomorrow you will be 'Victor the Famous' again. I hope this  shower won't spoil the ball game.”    As night deepened, the rain fell steadily. Up in Victor Burleigh's room  Bug Buler grew drowsy early.    “I want to say my pwayers now, Vic,” he said.    The big fellow put down his book and took the child in his arms. Bug  had a genius for praying briefly and for others rather than for himself.  Tonight he merely clasped his chubby hands and said, reverently:    “Dear Dod, please ist make Vic dood as folks finks he is, for Thwist's  sake. Amen-n-n.”    When he fell asleep, Victor sat a long while staring at the window where  the May rain was beating heavily. At length, he bent over little Bug and  pushed back the curls from his brow. Bug smiled up drowsily and went on  sleeping.    “As good as folks think I am, Bug!” he mused. “You have gotten between  me and the rattlesnakes that were after my soul a good many times,  little brother-of-mine. As good as folks think I am! Do you know what it  costs to be that good?”    Ten minutes later he sat in Lloyd Fenneben's library.    “I have come for help,” he said in reply to the Dean's questioning face.    “I hope I can give it,” Fenneben responded.    “It's about tomorrow's game. There are sure to be some professional  players on the other team. I want Sunrise to win. I want to win myself.”   Vic's voice was harsh tonight. And the Dean caught the hard tone.    “I want Sunrise to win. I want you to win. There will probably be some  professionals to play against, but we have no way of proving this,”   Fenneben said.    “What do you think of such playing, Doctor?” Vic asked.    “I think the rule about professionalism is often a strained piece of  foolishness. It is violated persistently and persistently winked at, but  so long as it is the rule there is only one square thing to do, and that  is to live up to the law. You should not dread any professionalism in  the game tomorrow, however. You'll bring us through anyhow, and keep the  Sunrise name and fame untarnished.” The Dean smiled genially.    Burleigh's face was very pale and a strange fire burned in his eyes.    “Dr. Fenneben”--his musical voice rang clear--“I'm only a poor devil  from the short-grass country where life each year depends on that year's  crop. Three years out of four, the wind and drouth bring only failure  at harvest time. Then we starve our bodies and grip onto hope and  determination with our souls till seedtime comes again. I want a college  education. Last summer burned us out as usual within a month of harvest.  Then the mortgage got in its work on my claim and I had to give it up.  I had barely enough to get through here at pauper rates this year--but  I could n't do it and keep Bug, too. I went into Colorado and played  baseball for pay, so I could come here and bring him with me. That's why  I can out-bat our team, and could win dead easy for Sunrise tomorrow.  Nobody in Kansas knows it. Now, what shall I do?”    The words were shot out like bullets.    “What shall you do?” Lloyd Fenneben's black eyes held Burleigh. “There  is only one thing to do. When you ranked high in grades with only the  trivial matter of excusable absence against you--no broken law--you took  Professor Burgess gently by the throat and told him you meant to play  anyhow. You stood your ground like a man, for your own sake and for the  honor of Sunrise. Stand like a man for your own sake and the honor of  Sunrise, now. Go to Professor Burgess and take him gently--by the hand,  this time--and tell him you do not mean to play, and why you cannot.”    Burleigh sat still as stone, his face white as marble, his wide-open  eyes under his black brows seeing nothing.    “But our proud record--the glorious honor of this college,” he said at  length, and back of his words was the thought of Victor Burleigh, the  idol of Sunrise, dethroned, where he had been adored.    “There is no honor for a college like the honesty of its students. There  is no prouder record than the record of daring to do the right. You  could get into the game once by a brute's strength. Get out of it now by  a gentleman's honor.”    Behind the speech was Lloyd Fenneben himself, sympathetic, firm,  upright, before whom the harshness of Victor Burleigh's face slowly gave  place to an expression of sorrow.    “My boy,” Fenneben said gently, “Nature gave us the Walnut Valley with  its limestone ledges and fine forest trees. But before our Sunrise could  be builded the ledge had to be shapen into the hewn stone, the green  tree to the seasoned lumber, quarter-sawed oak--quarter-sawed, mind you.  Mill, forge and try-pit, ax and saw and chisel, with cleft and blow  and furnace heat, shaped them all for Service. Over our doorway is  the Sunrise initial. It stands also for Strife, part of which you know  already; but it stands for Sacrifice as well. You are in the shaping.  God grant you may be turned out a man fitted by Sacrifice for Service  when the shaping is done.”    Burleigh rose, silent still, and the two went out together. At the  doorway, he turned to Fenneben, who grasped his hand without a word. And  once again, the firm hand clasp of the Dean of Sunrise seemed to bind  the country boy to the finer things of life. It had done the same on  that day after the Thanksgiving game when he sat in Fenneben's study,  and understood for the first time what gives the right to pride in  brawny arm and steel-spring nerve.    After Burleigh left him, Lloyd Fenneben stood for a long time on his  veranda in the light of the doorway watching the steady downpour of the  warm May rain. As he turned at length to enter the house a rough-looking  man with rain-soaked clothing and slouched hat, sprang out of the  shadows.    “Stranger,” he called hastily. “There's a little child fell in the river  round the bend, and his mother got hold of him, but she can't pull him  out, and can't hold on much longer. Will you come help me, quick? I've  only got one arm or I would n't have had to ask for help.”    An empty sleeve was flapping in the rain, and Fenneben did not notice  then that the man kept that side of himself all the time in the shadows.  Fenneben had only one thought as he hurried away in the darkness, to  save the woman and child. His companion said little, directing the  course toward the bend in the river before the gateway of Pigeon Place.  As they pushed on with all speed through rain and mud, Fenneben was  hardly conscious that Dennie Saxon's words about the lonely gray-haired  hermit woman were recurring curiously to his mind.    “If talking about Sunrise made her cry like that, maybe you might do  something for her,” Dennie had said. He had never tried to do anything  for her. Somehow she seemed to be the woman who was in peril now, and  he was half-consciously blaming himself that he had never tried to help  her, had not even thought of her for months. Women were not in his line,  except the kindly impersonal interest he felt for all the Sunrise  girls, and his sense of responsibility for Norrie, and the memory of a  girl--oh, the hungry haunting memory!    All this in a semi-conscious fleetness swept across his mind, that was  bent on reaching the river, and on that woman holding a drowning child.  At the bend in the river, the man halted suddenly.    “Look out! There's a stone; don't stumble!” he said hoarsely, dodging  back as he spoke.    Then Fenneben was conscious of his own feet striking the slab of stone  by the roadside, of a sudden shove from somebody behind him, a two-armed  man it must have been, of stumbling blindly, trying to catch at the elm  tree that stood there, of falling through the underbrush, headforemost,  into the river, even of striking the water. As he fell, he was very  faintly conscious of a sense of pity for Victor Burleigh fighting out a  battle with his own honor tonight, and then he must have heard a dog's  fierce yelp, and a woman's scream. Somehow, it seemed to come through  distance of time, as out of past years, and not through length of  space--and then of a brutal laugh and an oath with the words:    “Now for Josh Wream, and--”    But Fenneben's head had struck the stone ledge against which the Walnut  ripples at low tide, and for a long time he knew no more.    It was raining still when Victor Burleigh reached the Saxon House.  At the door he met Professor Burgess, who was just leaving. Strangely  enough, the memory of their first meeting at the campus gate on a  September day flashed into the mind of each as they came face to face  now. They never spoke to each other except when it was necessary. And  yet tonight, something made them greet each other courteously.    “Professor, will you be kind enough to come up to my room a few  minutes?” Burleigh asked, lifting his cap to his instructor with the  words.    “Certainly,” Vincent Burgess said with equal grace.    Bug Buler had kicked off the bed covering and lay fast asleep on his  little cot with his stubby arms bare, and his little fat hands, dimpled  in each knuckle, thrown wide apart.    “I saw a picture like this once for the sign of the cross,” Vic said as  he drew the covering over the little form. “Bug has been a cross to me  sometimes, but he's oftener my salvation.”    Professor Burgess wondered again, why a boy like Burleigh should have  been given a voice of such rare charm.    “I will not keep you long,” Vic said, turning from Bug. “I cannot play  in tomorrow's game, and be a man.”    Then, briefly, he explained the reason.    “It is raining still. Take my umbrella,” he said at the close of his  simply told story. “But tomorrow's sunshine will dry the field for the  game, all right. Good night.”    “Good night,” Vincent Burgess said hoarsely, and plunged into the  darkness and the rain.    Ten steps from the Saxon House, he came plump into Bond Saxon, who  staggered a little to avoid him.    “My luck on rainy nights,” Vincent thought. “The old fellow's sprees  seem to run with the storms. He hasn't been 'off' for a long time.”    But Bond Saxon was never more sober in his life, and he clutched the  young man's arm eagerly.    “Professor Burgess, won't you help me!” he cried.    “What do you want to do on a night like this?” Burgess asked,  remembering the vow he had been forced to make, by this same man.    “Come help me save a man's life!” Bond urged.    “Look here, Saxon. You've got some wild notion out of a boot-legger's  bottle. Straighten up now. It's an infamous thing in a college town like  Lagonda Ledge, where neither a saloon nor a joint would be allowed, that  some imp of Satan should forever be bringing you whisky. Who does it,  anyhow?”    “I'm not drunk and haven't been for six months. Come on, for God's sake,  and help me to save a life, maybe two lives, from the very man that's  done the boot-leggin' and robbin' in this town for months and months.”   Saxon's words were convincing enough.    “What can I do?” Burgess asked. “I'm not a policeman.”    “Come on! Come on!” Saxon urged, tugging at the professor's arm. “It 's  a life, I tell you.”    Vincent yielded unwillingly, the night, the beating rain, the man who  asked it of him, the purpose, his own unfitness--all holding him back.  Before they had gone far, Bond Saxon suddenly exclaimed:    “Say, Professor, do you remember the night I asked you to take care of  Dennie if anything should happen to me?”    “Do YOU remember it?” Burgess responded. “You didn't ask; you demanded.”    “I was drunk then. I'm sober now. Burgess, if anything should happen to  me now, would you still be willing?” Bond Saxon asked in tense anxiety.    “I've already taken oath,” Burgess said. “I think your daughter may need  somebody's care before anything happens if you keep up this gait.”    They hurried on through the rain until they had left the board walk and  the town lights, and were staggering along the cinder-made path, when  Burgess halted.    “Saxon, who's the man, or two men, you want to save? I believe you are  drunk.”    Bond Saxon grasped his arm, and said hoarsely:    “Don't shriek here. We are in danger, now. It's not two men. It's a man  and a woman, maybe. It's Dean Funnybone. Come on!”        CHAPTER X. THE THIEF IN THE MOUTH     _O, thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no,   name to be known by, let us call thee, devil!_                      --SHAKESPEARE    WHEN Lloyd Fenneben could think again, the waters had receded, the  rock ledge had turned to a pillow under his head, the river bank was a  straight white hospital wall, sunlight and sweet air for the darkness  and the rain, and Norrie Wream was beside him instead of the brutal  stranger. His heavy black hair was shorn away and his head was bound  with much soft cotton stuffs. His left arm was full of prickles, as if  the blood had just resumed circulation.    “And meantime?” he said, looking up at Elinor.    “Yes, meantime, it's June time,” Elinor replied.    “Well, and what of Sunrise? Did we--”    “Oh, yes, we did. The college first. The ruling passion, strong in the  hospital. When a Wream gets to kingdom-come, he always asks Saint  Peter first for a mortar board and gown instead of a crown and wings.”   Norrie's eyes were shining. “And he's a little particular about the  lining of the wings, too--Purple, for Law; White, for Letters; Blue,  for Philosophy; Red, for Divinity. Take this quieting powder. College  presidents should be seen and not heard.” She smilingly silenced him.    Under her gentle ministrations, Dr. Fenneben could picture what comfort  might be in store for Vincent Burgess in a day, doubtless only two years  away. He resented Joshua Wream's estimate of Elinor. Surely Joshua had  never seen her in the place of nurse.    “Now, meantime, Uncle Lloyd,” Elinor was saying, “commencement passed  off beautifully under Acting-Dean Burgess, considering how sad and  heavy-hearted everybody was. The trustees want to raise Professor  Burgess's salary next year--he's so competent.”    Lloyd Fenneben's eyes were not bandaged, and as he looked at Elinor he  wondered at her utter lack of reserve and sentiment, when she spoke of  Burgess in such a frank, matter-of-fact way. When he was in love years  ago--but times must have changed.    “The arrangements for next year are all looked after. Everything will be  done exactly as you would have it done. There's not one thing to put a  worry into that cotton round your head.”    “Good! Now, tell me of 'beforehand.'” His smile was as charming as ever.    “In your fever you've been telling us about a one-armed man who had  two arms to push people into the river, of his wanting you to save some  child's life, and of your stumbling over the stone. That's all we know  about that. Bond Saxon and Professor Burgess found you in the water at  the north bend in the Walnut close to that hermit woman's house. Either  you fell in, or somebody pushed you down the bank, headforemost, and  you struck a ledge of rock.” Elinor's eyes were full of tears now. “You  would have been drowned, if that white-haired woman had n't jumped in  and held your head above water while she clung to the bushes with one  hand. Her dog helped, too, like a real hero. It stood on the bank and  held to her shawl that she had fastened round you to hold you. And the  river was rising so fast, too. It was awful. I don't know just how it  was all managed, Uncle Lloyd, but it was managed between the woman and  her dog at first, and Professor Burgess and Bond Saxon at last, and  you are safe now, and on the high road, the very elevated tracks, to  recovery. When your fever was the highest, the doctors kept telling me  about your splendid constitution and your temperate life. You must get  well now.”    She bent over him and softly caressed his hand.    “Where is that woman now? Dennie Saxon asked me once to do something for  her in her loneliness. She got ahead of my negligence and did something  for me, it seems.”    “She left Lagonda Ledge the very day they rushed us up here to the  hospital. Is n't she strange? And she is so gentle and sweet, but so  sad. I never saw such apathetic face as hers, Uncle Lloyd.”    “When did you see her?” Fenneben asked.    “She came to ask after you. Nobody thought you would get over it.”   Elinor's voice trembled. “The fever was burning you up and it took three  doctors to hold you. I saw her face when Dennie Saxon said they thought  you wouldn't pull through. Your own sister couldn't have turned whiter,  Uncle Lloyd.”    “And the one-armed man I seemed to remember?”    “I don't know. I've been too busy to ask many questions. Lagonda Ledge  is in mourning for you. It will run up the flag above half-mast when I  write how much better you are. Bond Saxon has a theory that some thief  wanted to rob you and decoyed you away on pretense of helping somebody  out of the river. You are an easy mark, Uncle.”    “Why should Bond Saxon have a theory? And how did he know where to find  me? And how did that gray-haired woman and her dog happen in on the  scene just then? This is a grim sort of dime novel business, Norrie.  Things don't fall out this way in real life unless there is some reason  back of them. I think I'll bear investigating.”    “I think so myself--you or your romantic rescuing squad. You might call  the dog to the witness stand first, for he was the first on the scene.  I forgot though that the dog is dead. They found him down the river  with his throat cut. The plot thickens.” Elinor's frivolous spirit was  returning with the lessening of care.    “Tell me about the ball game,” Fenneben said next.    “Oh, it rained for hours and hours, and there wasn't any train service  for Lagonda Ledge for a week, and all the Inter-Collegiate Athletic  events for the season were called off for Sun rise-by-the-Walnut.”    “And the students, generally?” Dr. Fenneben questioned.    “Mr. Trench will be back,” Elinor exclaimed, “and folks have just found  out that it's old Trench who's keeping that crippled boy in school, the  one they call 'Limpy.' Trench rustles jobs for him and divides his own  income for college expenses with the boy for the rest of the cost. I  don't know how the story got out, but I asked him about it when he was  up here to see you. He just grinned and drawled lazily, 'I can save a  little on shoe leather, that some fellows wear out hurrying so, and I  don't burst up so many hats with a swelled head as some do. So I keep a  little extra change on these accounts. We're going down to Oklahoma when  we graduate. Limpy's going to be a Methodist preacher and I a stockman.  I'll keep him in raw material for converts out of the cowboys I'll have  to handle.' Isn't old Trenchy a hero? He says Dean Funnybone showed him  how to think about somebody else beside Trench a little bit.”    “Oh, yes; Trench is a hero and I've known about that whole thing for a  long while,” the Dean asserted. “And Victor Burleigh?”    A shadow in the beautiful dark eyes, a half-tone lowering of the voice,  and a general indifference of manner, as Elinor answered:    “I'm sure I don't know anything about him, except that he's coming back  next year.”    Dr. Fenneben read the whole story in the words and manner of the answer,  and he smiled grimly as he thought of Burgess and of the conflict of  Wream against Wream if Elinor and his brother Joshua ever came to the  clash of arms. But he was too weak now to direct matters.      And meantime, while Lagonda Ledge was holding its breath in anxiety and  dread, and all the churches were joining in union prayer service for the  life of their beloved Dean Fenneben, and the college year was ending  in a halting between hope and dread--meantime, the same queries of Dr.  Fenneben as to motives were also queries in Professor Burgess' mind.    To the school and the town Dr. Fenneben's recovery was the only thing  asked for. There was as yet no clew regarding the cause of the assault.  Bond Saxon had avoided Burgess since the event, so the young man himself  made occasion to get Bond up into Dr. Fenneben's study one June day just  before commencement.    “Saxon,” he said gravely, “you are a man of sense, and you know that  there's something wrong about this Fenneben assault. You've put up some  smooth stories about our happening to be out at the bend of the river  that night, so I guess suspicion will be turned from us all right when  Lagonda Ledge gets time to think about causes; but I must be let into  the truth now.” Burgess was adamant now.    For a little while the old man looked away through the study window at  the prairie empire to be found for the looking.    “Do you see that little twist of blue smoke over west?” he queried  presently.    “What of it?” Burgess asked.    “Nothing, only the man huddlin' down round the fire makin' that smoke  way down where it's cold and dark, that's the man who--say, Professor!”    Old Bond looked up appealingly, and the pitiful face touched Burgess'  heart.    “What is it, Saxon? Be frank now, but be fair, too. Sooner or later,  this thing must be run down. Fenneben will do it himself, anyhow, as  soon as he's well enough.”    “Professor, I have asked you twice if you'd be good to Dennie--”    “Yes, yes; you always come back to that. Anybody would be good to her,  and she's a capable girl who does n't need anybody's care, anyhow. Now,  go on.”    “I will”--it seemed an heroic resolve--“I asked this for Dennie, because  my own life is never safe.”    “So you have said. Why not?” Burgess insisted. There was no way to evade  the question now.    “That's my own business--just a little longer,” Bond answered slowly.  “One thing more; I want your promise not to tell what I say--yet awhile.  It can't hurt anyone to keep still, and it will help some folks.”    “Oh, I'll help you all I can.” Burgess's kindly patience now was  strangely unlike the aristocratic, resentful man to whom old Bond Saxon  had appealed one stormy October night.    “I'm a failure, Professor. I've spoiled my life by my infernal weak will  and appetite for whisky. I know it as well as you do. But I'm not meant  for a bad man.” There was unspeakable pathos in Saxon's face and words.    “Nobody would call you bad. You are a lovable man when you--keep  straight,” Burgess declared cordially.    “I graduated from the university back in the sixties,” Bond went on.    “You!” Burgess exclaimed.    “Yes, I'm one of your alumni brothers from Harvard. It takes more 'n a  college diploma to make a man sometimes, although this would mighty soon  get to be a cheap, destructible nation, if we should pull the colleges  out of it. The boys I've seen Sunrise make into men does an old man's  heart good to think about! But there's more than book-learning in a  Master's Degree. There must be MASTERY in it. I never got farther 'n  an A.B., partly because Nature made me easy going, but mostly because  whisky ruined me. I finally came to Kansas. I'd have had tremens long  ago but for that. But even here a man's got to keep the law inside, or  no human law can prevent his making a beast of himself.”    Saxon paused, and the professor waited.    “The man that sets the cussed trap for me is a law breaker, an escaped  convict, and a murderer. That's what drinking did for him; drinking and  injustice in money matters together.”    Burgess started and his face grew pale.    “Oh, it's a fact, Professor. There are several roads to ruin. One by  the route I've taken. One may be too much love of money, of women, or  of having your own way. You can ruin your soul by getting it set on one  thing above everything else. Education, for instance, like the Wreams  back there in Cambridge.”    “The Wreams!” Burgess exclaimed.    “Yes, old Joshua Wream sold himself to an appetite for musty old  Sanscrit till he'd sacrifice anybody's comfort and joy for it, same as I  sold out to a fool's craving for drink. You'll know the Wreams sometime  as I know 'em now. Fenneben's only a stepbrother and the West made a man  of him. He was always a gentleman.”    “Go on!” Vincent's voice was hardly audible.    “This outlaw, boot-legger, thief, and murderer was a respectable fellow  once, the adopted son of a wealthy family back East, who began by  spoiling him, lavished money on him, and let him have his own way in  everything. He was a gay youngster on the side, given to drinking and  fast company. He fell in love with a pretty girl, but when she found him  out, she cut him. Then he went to the dogs, blaming her because she had  sense enough to throw him over where he belonged. She fell in love--the  right kind of love--with another man. And this young fool who had no  claim on her at all, swore vengeance. Her family wanted her to marry the  young sport because he had money. They were long on money--her father  was, anyhow. But she would n't do it.”    “Did she marry the one she really cared for?” Burgess asked eagerly.    “No; but that's another story. Meantime this fellow's father died,  leaving the boy he, himself, had started on the wrong road, entirely out  of his will. The boy went to the devil--and he's still there.”    Saxon paused and looked once more at the tiny wavering smoke column,  hardly visible now.    “He's over yonder hiding away from the light of day under the bluffs by  the fire that sends that curl of smoke up through the crevices in the  rock, an outlaw thief.”    Saxon gazed long at the landscape beyond the Walnut. When he spoke  again, it was with an effort.    “Professor, this outlaw got a hold on me once when I was drunk, drunk  by his making. It would do no good to tell you about that. You could n't  help me, nor harm him. You'll trust me in this?”    A picture of Dennie down in the Kickapoo Corral, with the flickering  firelight on her rippling hair, the weird, shadowy woodland, and the old  Indian legend all came back to the young man now, though why he could  not say.    “I certainly would never bring harm to you nor yours,” he said kindly.    “I can't inform on the scoundrel. I can only watch him. The woman he was  in love with years ago, who would n't stand for his wild ways--that's  the gray-haired woman at Pigeon Place. Her life's been one long tragedy,  though she is not forty yet.”    The anguish on the old man's face was pitiful as he spoke.    “She has a reason of her own for living here, and she is the soul of  courage. On the night of the Fenneben accident, I was out her way--yes,  running away from Bond Saxon. I knew if I stayed in town, I'd get drunk  on a bottle left at my door. So I tore out in the rain and the dark to  fight it out with the devil inside of me. And out at Pigeon Place I run  onto this fiend. When I ordered him back to his hiding place, he vowed  he'd get Fenneben and put him in the river. There's one or two human  things about him still. One is his fear of little children, and one is  his love for that woman. He really did adore her years ago. I tracked  home after him, and you know the rest. He put up some story to the Dean  to entice him out there.”    He hesitated, then ceased to speak.    “Why the Dean?” Burgess asked.    “Because Lloyd Fenneben's the man she loved years ago, and her folks  wouldn't let her marry,” Bond Saxon said sadly.    Burgess felt as if the limestone ridge was giving way beneath him.    “Where is she now?”    “She's gone, nobody knows where. I hope to heaven she will never come  back,” the old man replied.    “And it was she who saved Dr. Fenneben's life? Does he know who she is?”    “No, no. She's never let him know, and if she does n't want him to know,  whose business is it to tell him?” Saxon urged. “I have hung about and  protected her when she never knew I was near. But when I'm drunk, I'm  an idiot and my mind is bent against her. I'd die to save her, and yet  I may kill her some day when I don't know it.” Bond Saxon's head was  drooping pitifully low.    “But why live in such slavery? Why not tell all you know about this man  and let the law protect a helpless woman?” Burgess urged.    Old Bond Saxon looked up and uttered only one word--“Dennie!”    Vincent Burgess turned away a moment. Dennie! Yes, there was Dennie.    “This woman had a husband, you say?” he asked presently.    Bond Saxon stared straight at him and slowly nodded his head.    “What became of him? Do you know?” Vincent questioned.    Saxon leaned forward, and, clutching Vincent Burgess by the arm,  whispered hoarsely, “He's dead. I killed him. But I was drunk when I did  it. And this man knows it and holds me bound.”        SERVICE     _If you were born to honor, show       it now;   if put upon you, make the judgment       good that thought you       worthy of it_.                 --SHAKESPEARE      CHAPTER XI. THE SINS OF THE FATHERS     _They enslave their children's children who make       compromise with sin_.                                --LOWELL    IT was mid-December before Lloyd Fenneben saw Lagonda Ledge again. In  the murderous attempt upon his life, he had been hurled, head-downward,  upon the hidden rock-ledge with such force that even his strong nervous  system could barely overcome the shock. Hours of unconsciousness were  followed by a raging brain fever, and paralysis, insanity, and death  strove together against him. His final complete recovery was slow, and  he was wise enough to let nature have ample time for rebuilding what  had been so cruelly wrenched out of line. It was this very patience  and willingness to take life calmly, when most men would have been in a  fever of anxiety about neglected business, that brought Lloyd Fenneben  back to Lagonda Ledge in December, a perfectly well man; and aside from  the holiday given in honor of the event, aside from the display of  flags and the big “Welcome” done in electric lights awaiting him at the  railroad station, where all the portable population of Lagonda Ledge and  most of the Walnut Valley, headed by the Sunrise contingent, en masse,  seemed to be waiting also--aside from the demonstration and general  hilarity and thanksgiving and rejoicing, there seemed no difference  between the Dean of the days that followed and the Dean of the years  before. His black hair was as long and heavy as ever. His black eyes had  lost nothing of their keenness. His smile was just the same old, genial  outbreak of good will, as he heard the wildly enthusiastic refrain:     Rah for Funnybone!   Rah for Funnybone!   Rah for Funnybone!   _Rah!_ RAH!! RAH!!!      It was twilight when the train pulled up to the station. The December  evening was clear and crisp as southern Kansas Decembers usually are.  The lights of the town were twinkling in the dusk. Out beyond the river  a gorgeous purple and scarlet after-sunset glow was filling the west  with that magnificence of coloring only the hand of Nature dares to  paint.    Several passengers left the train, but the company had eyes only for the  Pullman car where Fenneben was riding. Nobody, except Bond Saxon, and  a cab driver on the edge of the crowd, noticed a gray-haired woman  who alighted so quietly and slipped to the cab so quickly that she was  almost out to Pigeon Place before Fenneben had been able to clear the  platform.    Behind the Dean was his niece, who halted on the car steps while her  uncle went into the outstretched arms of Lagonda Ledge. At sight of her,  the hats went high in air, as she stood there smiling above the crowd.  It was Maytime when she went away. They had remembered her in dainty  Maytime gowns. They were not prepared for her in her handsome traveling  costume of golden brown, her brown beaver hat, and pretty furs. A  beautiful girl can be so charming in her winter feathers. She had  expected that Burgess would be first to meet her, and she was ready, she  thought, to greet him, becomingly. But as the porter helped her to the  platform, the crowd closed in, shutting him away momentarily, and a hand  caught hers, a big, strong hand whose clasp, so close and warm, seemed  to hold her hand by right of eternal possession. And Victor Burleigh's  brown eyes full of a joyous light were looking down at her. It was all  such a sweet, shadowy time that nobody crowding about them could see  clearly how Elinor, with shining face, nestled involuntarily close to  his arm for just one instant, and her low murmured words, “I am glad  you were first,” were lost to all but the big fellow before her, and  a bigger, vastly lazy fellow, Trench, just behind her. It was Trench's  bulk that had blocked the way for the professor a moment before. Then  she was swallowed in the jolly greetings of goodfellowship, and Vincent  Burgess carried her away to the carriage where her uncle waited.    “The thing is settled now,” the young folks thought. But Dennie Saxon  and Trench, who walked home together, knew that many things were  hopelessly unsettled. By the law of natural fitness, Dennie and Trench  should have fallen in love with each other. They were so alike in  goodness of heart. But such mating of like with like, is rare, and under  its ruling the world would grow so monotonously good, on the one hand,  and bad, on the other, that life would be uninteresting.    During Dr. Fenneben's absence, Professor Burgess was acting-dean. For a  man who, two years before, had never heard of a Jayhawker, who hoped  the barren prairies would furnish seclusion for profound research in his  library, and whose interest in the student body lay in its material to  furnish “types,” Dean Burgess, on the outside, certainly measured  up well toward the stature of the real Dean--broad-minded, beloved  “Funnybone.”    And as Vincent Burgess grew in breadth of view and human interest, his  popularity increased and his opportunities multiplied. Sunrise forgot  that it had ever regarded him as a walking Greek textbook in paper  binding. Next to Dr. Lloyd Fenneben, his place at Sunrise would be the  hardest to fill now; and withal, sometime in the near future, there was  waiting for him the prettiest girl that ever climbed the steps from the  lower campus to the Sunrise door. Burgess had never dreamed that life in  Kansas could be so full of pleasure for him.    And all the while, on the inside, another Burgess was growing up who  quarreled daily with this happy outer Burgess. This inner man it was who  held the secret of Bond Saxon's awful crime; the man who knew the life  story of the would-be assassin of Lloyd Fenneben, and who knew the  tragedy that had turned a fair-faced girl to a gray-haired woman, yet  young in years. He knew the tragedy, but the woman herself he had never  seen, save in the darkness and rain of that awful night when she had  held Lloyd Fenneben's head above the fast rising waters of the Walnut.  He had never even heard her voice, for he had sustained the limp body of  Dr. Fenneben while Saxon helped the woman from the river and as far  as to her own gate. But these were secret things outside of his own  conscience. Inside of his conscience the real battle was fought and won,  and lost, only to be won and lost over and over. So long as Elinor  Wream was away, he could stay execution on himself. The same train that  brought her home to Lagonda Ledge, brought a letter to Professor Vincent  Burgess, A.B. The letter heading bore as many of Dr. Joshua Wream's  titles as space would permit, but the cramped, old-fashioned handwriting  belonged to a man of more than fourscore years, and it was signed just  “J. R.”    Burgess read this letter many times that night after he returned from  dinner at the Fenneben home. And sometimes his fists were clinched and  sometimes his blue eyes were full of tears. Then he remembered  little Bug, who had declared once that “Don Fonnybone was dood for  twoubleness.”    “I can't take this to Fenneben,” he mused, as he read Joshua Wream's  letter for the tenth time. “Nor can I go to Saxon. He's never sure of  himself and when he's drunk, he reverses himself and turns against  his best friends. And who am I to turn to a man like Bond Saxon for my  confidences?”    “What about Elinor?” came a voice from somewhere. “The woman you would  make your wife should be the one to whose loving sympathy you could turn  at any of life's angles, else that were no real marriage.”    “Elinor, of all people in the world, the very last. She shall never  know, never!” So he answered the inward questioner.    Dimly then rose up before him the picture of Victor Burleigh on the  rainy May night when he stood beside little Bug Buler's bed--Victor  Burleigh, with his white, sorrowful face, and burning brown eyes,  telling in a voice like music the reason why he must renounce athletic  honors in Sunrise.    Burgess had been unconsciously exultant over the boy's confession. It  would put the confessor out of reach of any claim to Elinor's friendship  when the truth was known about his poverty and his professional playing.  And yet he had followed Bond Saxon's lead the more willingly that night  that he was hating himself for rejoicing with himself.    On this December night, with Elinor once more in Lagonda Ledge, Victor  Burleigh must come again to trouble him. What a price that boy must  have paid for his honesty! But he paid it, aye, he paid it! And then  the rains put out the game and nobody knew except Burleigh and himself.  Burgess almost resented the kindness of Fate to the heroic boy. But all  this solved no problems for Vincent Burgess, except the realization  that here was one fellow who had a soul of courage. Could he confide in  Burleigh? Not in a thousand years!    In utter loneliness, Vincent Burgess put out his light and stared at the  window. The street lamps glowed in lonely fashion, for it was very late,  and nobody was abroad. Up on the limestone ridge, the Sunrise beacon  shone bravely. Down in town beside the campus gate--he could just  catch a glimpse of one steady beam. It was the faithful old lamp in the  hallway of the Saxon House, and beyond that unwavering light was Dennie.    “Dennie! Why have I not thought of her? The only one in the world whom I  can fully trust. That ought to be a man's sweetheart, I suppose, but she  is not mine. She is just Dennie. Heaven bless her! I've sworn to care  for her. She must help me now.” And with the comforting thought, he fell  asleep beside the window.      The December sunset was superb in a glory of endless purple mists and  rose-tinted splendor of far-reaching skies. The evening drops down early  at this season and the lights were gleaming here and there in the town  where the shadows fall soonest before the day's work is finished up in  Sunrise.    Victor Burleigh, who had been called to Dr. Fenneben's study, found only  Elinor there, looking out at the radiant beauty of the sunset sky beyond  the homey shadows studded with the twinkling lights of Lagonda Ledge at  the foot of the slope. The young man hesitated a little before entering.  All day the school had been busy settling affairs for Professor Burgess  and “Norrie, the beloved.” Gossip has swift feet and from surmise to  fact is a short course. Twenty-four hours had quite completely “fixed  things” for Elinor Wream and Vincent Burgess, so far as Sunrise and  Lagonda Ledge were able to fix them. So Burleigh, whose strong face  carried no hint of grief, held back a minute now, before entering the  study.    “I beg your pardon, Elinor. Dr. Fenneben sent for me.”    Somehow the deep musical voice and her name pronounced as nobody else  ever could pronounce it, and the big manly form and brave face, all  seemed to complete the spell of the sunset hour. Elinor did not speak,  but with a smile made room for him beside her at the window, and the  two looked long at the deepening grandeur of the heavens and the misty  shadows of heliotrope and silver darkening softly to the twilight below  them.    “And God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the  fourth day,” Victor said at last.    “Your voice grows richer with the passing years, Victor,” Elinor said  softly. “I wanted to hear it again the first time I heard you speak out  there one September day.”    “It is well to grow rich in something,” Victor said, half-earnestly,  half-carelessly.    Before Elinor could say more, they caught sight of Professor Burgess  and Dennie Saxon, leaving the front portico as they had done on the May  evening before the assault on Dr. Fenneben. Burgess and Dennie usually  left the building together this year.    “Is n't Dennie a darling? Elinor said calmly.    “I guess so,” he replied. “I don't just know what makes a girl a darling  to another girl. I only know”--he was on thin ice now--“and I don't even  know that very well.”    They turned to the landscape again. The whole building was growing  quiet. Footsteps were fading away down the halls. Doors clicked faintly  here and there. Somebody was singing softly in the basement laboratory,  and the sunset sky was exquisitely lovely above the quiet gray December  prairies.    “It is too beautiful to last,” Elinor said, turning to the young man  beside her. “The joy of it is too deep for us to hold.”    She did not mean to stay a moment longer, for all the scene could be  hers forever in memory--imperishable!--and Victor did not mean to detain  her. But her face as she turned from the window, the hallowed setting  of time and opportunity, and a heart-love hungering through hopeless,  slow-dragging months, all had their own way with him. He put out his  arms to her and she nestled within them, lifting a face to his own  transfigured with love's sweetness. And he bent and kissed her red lips,  holding her close in his arms. And in the shadowy twilight, with the  faintly roseate banners of the sunset's after-glow trailing through it,  for just one minute, heaven and earth came very near together for these  two. And then they remembered, and Elinor put her hand in Victor's, who  held it in his without a word.    Out in the hall, Trench with soft lazy step had just come to the study  door in time to see and turn away unseen, and slowly pass out of the big  front door, whistling low the while:     My sweetheart lives on the prairies wide       By the sandy Cimarron,   In a day to come she will be my bride,       By the sandy Cimarron.      Out by the big stone pillars of the portico, he looked toward the south  turret and saw Dr. Fenneben as Vic had seen Elinor on the evening of  the May storm. He did not call, but with a twist of the fingers as of  unlocking a door, he dodged back into the building and up to the chapel  end of the turret stairs to release the Dean.    Dr. Fenneben had started down to the study by the same old “road to  perdition” stairs and paused at the window as Dennie and Burgess were  passing out, unconscious of three pairs of eyes on them. Then the Dean  saw down through the half-open study door the two young people by the  window, and he knew he was not needed there. What that look in his black  eyes meant, as he turned to the half-way window of the turret, it would  have been hard to read. And the picture of a fair-faced girl came back  to his own hungry memory. He was trying to calculate the distance from  the turret window to the ground when Trench wig-wagged a rescue signal.    “You are a brick, Trench,” he said, as the upper stairway door swung  open to release him.    “You've the whole chimney,” Trench responded, as he swung himself away.    Dr. Fenneben met Elinor in the rotunda.    “Wait a minute, Norrie, and I'll walk home with you.”    In the study he met Burleigh, whose stern face was tender with a  pathetic sadness, but there was no embarrassment in his glance. And  Fenneben, being a man himself, knew what power for sacrifice lay back of  those beautiful eyes.    “I can't give him the message I meant to give now. The man said there  was no hurry. A veritable tramp he looked to be. I hope there is no harm  to the boy in it. Why should a girl like Norrie love the pocketbook, and  the things of the pocketbook, when a heart like Victor Burleigh's calls  to her? I know men. I never shall know women.” So he thought. Aloud he  said: “I was detained, Burleigh, and I'll have to see you again. I have  some matters to consider with you soon.”    And Burleigh wondered much what “some matters” might be.    When Professor Burgess left Dennie he said, lightly:    “Miss Dennie, I need a little help in my work. Would you let me call  this evening and talk it over with you? I don't believe anybody else  would get hold of it quite so well.”    Dennie had supposed this first evening after Elinor's return would  find her lover making use of it. Why should Dennie not feel a thrill of  pleasure that her services out-weighed everything else? Poor Dennie! She  was no flirt, but much association with Vincent Burgess had given her  insight to know that Norrie Wream would never understand him.    When Burgess returned to the Saxon House later in the evening, he met  Bond Saxon at the door.    “Say, Professor, the devil will be to pay again. That Mrs. Marian is  back. Got here on the same train Funnybone came on. And,” lowering his  voice, “he will be over there again,” pointing toward the west bluffs.  “He'll hound Funnybone to his doom yet. And she--she'll stand between  'em to the last. I told you one of the two human traits left in that  beast is his fool fondness for that woman who wouldn't let him set foot  on her ground if she knew it. It's a grim tragedy being played out here  with nobody knowing but you and me.”    “Saxon, I'm in no mood for all this tonight,” Burgess said, “but for  your daughter's sake keep away from the man's bottle now.”    “Yes, for Dennie's sake--” Bond looked imploringly at Burgess.    “Yes, yes, I'll do my duty as I promised. But why not do it yourself  toward her? Why not be a man and a father?”    “Me! A criminal! Do you know what that kind of slavery is?” Saxon  whispered.    “Almost,” Burgess answered, but the old man did not catch his meaning.    Dennie was waiting in the parlor, a cosy little room but without the  luxurious appointments of Norrie Wream's home. Yet tonight Dennie seemed  beautiful to Burgess, and this quiet little room, a haven of safety.    “Dennie,” he said, plunging into his purpose at once. “I come to you  because I need a friend and you are tempered steel.”    Tonight Dennie's gray eyes were dark and shining. The rippling waves of  yellow brown hair gave a sort of Madonna outline to her face, and there  was about her something indefinably pleasant.    “What can I do for you, Professor Burgess?” she asked.    “Listen to me, Dennie, and then advise me.”    Was this the acting-dean of Sunrise, a second Fenneben, already  declared? His face was full of pathos, yet even in his feverish grief  it seemed a better face to Dennie than the cold scholarly countenance of  two years ago.    “My troubles go back a long way. My father was given to greed. He sold  himself and my sister's happiness and mine for money. You think your  father is a slave, Dennie, because he has a craving for whisky. Less  than half a dozen times a year the demon inside gets him down.”    Dennie looked up with a sorrowful face.    “Yes, but think of what he might do. You don't know what dreadful things  he has done--”    “Yes, I do. He told me himself the very worst. I'll never betray him,  Dennie. His punishment is heavy enough.”    Burgess laid his hand on her dimpled hand in token of sincerity.    “But that's only rarely, little girl. My father every day in the year  gave himself to an appetite for money till he cared for nothing else.  My sister, who died believing that I also had turned against her, was  forced to marry a man she did not love because he had money. I never  knew the man she did love. It was a romance of her girlhood. I was away  from home the most of my boyhood years, and she never mentioned his name  after the affair was broken off. All I know is that she was deceived and  made to believe some cruel story against him. She and her husband came  West, where they died. My father never forgave them for going West, nor  permitted me to speak her name to him. I never knew why until yesterday.  My sister's husband had a brother out here with whom he meant to divide  some possessions he had inherited. That settled him with my father  forever. There was no DIVISION of property in his creed.”    Burgess paused. Dennie's interest and sympathy made her silent company a  comfort.    “I was heir to my father's estate, and heir also to some funds he held  in trust. I was a scholar with ambition for honors--a Master's Degree  and a high professional place in a great university. I trusted my whole  life plans to the man who knew my father best--Dr. Joshua Wream.”    Dennie looked up, questioningly.    “Yes, to Elinor's uncle, as unlike Dr. Fenneben as night and day.”    “Do not blame me, Dennie, if two men have helped to misshape my life.  My father believed that money is absolute. Dr. Wream holds scholarly  achievement as the greatest life work. It has been Dr. Fenneben's part  to show me the danger and the power in each.”    It was dimly dawning on Burgess that the presence of Dennie, good,  sensible Dennie, was a blessing outside of these things that could go  far toward making life successful. But he did not grasp it clearly yet.    “Dr. Wream and I made a compact before I came West. It seemed fair to me  then. By its terms I was assured, first, of my right to certain funds  my father held in trust. It was Wream who secured these rights for me.  Second, I was to succeed to his chair in Harvard if I proved worthy in  Sunrise. In return I promised to marry Elinor Wream and to provide for  her comfort and luxury with these trust funds my father and Wream had  somehow been manipulating.”    Oh, yes! Dennie was level-headed. And because she did not look up nor  cry out Vincent Burgess did not see nor guess anything. His life had  been a sheltered one. How could he measure Dennie's life-discipline in  self-control and loving bravery?    “Elinor was heavy on Wream's conscience,” Vincent went on, “because he  and her father, Dr. Nathan Wream, took the fortune to endow colleges and  university chairs that should have been hers from her mother's estate.  You see, Dennie, there was no wrong in the plan. Elinor would be  provided for by me. I would get up in my chosen profession. Nobody was  robbed or defrauded. Joshua Wream's last years would be peaceful with  his conscience at rest regarding Elinor's property. And, Dennie, who  would n't want to marry Elinor Wream?”    “Yes, who wouldn't?” Dennie looked up with a smile. And if there were  tears in her eyes Burgess knew they were born of Dennie's sweet spirit  of sympathy.    “What is wrong, then?” she asked. “Is Elinor unwilling?”    “Elinor and I are bound by promises to each other, although no word has  ever been spoken between us. It is impossible to make any change now. We  are very happy, of course.”    “Of course,” Dennie echoed.    “I had a letter from Dr. Wream last night. A pitiful letter, for he's  getting near the brink. Dennie--these funds I hold--I have never quite  understood, but I had felt sure there was no other claimant. There was  a clause in the strangely-worded bequest: 'for V. B. and his heirs.  Failing in that, to the nearest related V. B.' It was a thing for  lawyers, not Greek professors, to settle, and I came to be the nearest  related V. B., Vincent Burgess, for I find the money belonged to my  sister's husband, and I thought he left no heirs and I am the nearest  related V. B. by marriage, you see?”    “Well?” Dennie's mind was jumping to the end.    “My sister married a Victor Burleigh, who came to Kansas to find his  brother. Both men are dead now. The only one of the two families living  is this brother's son, young Victor Burleigh, junior in Sunrise College.  He knows nothing of his Uncle Victor, my brother-in-law--nor of money  that he might claim. He belongs to the soil out here. Nobody has any  claims on him, nor has he any ambition for a chair in Harvard, nor any  promise to marry and provide for a beautiful girl who looks upon him as  her future guardian.”    Vincent Burgess suddenly ceased speaking and looked at Dennie.    “I cannot break an old man's heart. He implores me not to reveal all  this, but I had to tell somebody, and you are the best friend a man  could ever have, Dennie Saxon, so I come to you,” he added presently.    “When did this Dr. Wream find out about Vic?” Dennie asked.    “A month ago. Some strange-looking tramp of a fellow brought him proofs  that are incontestable,” Burgess replied.    “And it is for an old man's peace you would keep this secret?” Dennie  questioned.    “For him and for Elinor--and for myself. Don't hate me, Dennie. Elinor  looks upon me as her future husband. I have promised to provide for  her with the comforts denied her by her father, and I have lived in the  ambition of holding that Harvard chair--Oh, it is all a hopeless tangle.  I could never go to Victor Burleigh now. He would not believe that I had  been ignorant of his claim all this time. He was never wrapped up in the  pursuit of a career--Oh, Dennie, Dennie, what shall I do?”    He rose to his feet and Dennie stood up before him. He gently rested his  hands on her shoulders and looked down at her.    “What shall you do?” Dennie repeated, slowly. “Whisky, Money,  Ambition--the appetite that destroys! Vincent Burgess, if you want to  win a Master's Degree, win to the Mastery of Manhood first. The sins of  the fathers, yours and mine, we cannot undo. But you can be a man.”    She had put her dimpled hands on his arms as they stood there, and  the brave courage of her upturned face called back again the rainy May  night, and the face of Victor Burleigh beside Bug Buler's cot, and his  low voice as he said:    “I cannot play in tomorrow's game and be a man.”        CHAPTER XII. THE SILVER PITCHER     _A picket frozen on duty--       A mother starved for her brood--       Socrates drinking the hemlock,       And Jesus on the rood.   And millions who, humble and nameless,       The straight hard pathway trod--       Some call it Consecration,       And others call it God_.            --WILLIAM HERBERT CARRUTH    “DR. FENNEBEN, I should like much to dismiss my classes for the  afternoon,” Professor Burgess said to the Dean in his study the next  day.    “Very well, Professor, I am afraid you are overworked with all my duties  added to yours here. But you don't look it,” Fenneben said, smiling.    Burgess was growing almost stalwart in this gracious climate.    “I am very well, Doctor. What a beautiful view this is.” He was looking  intently now at the Empire that had failed to interest him once.    “Yes; it is my inspiration. 'Each man's chimney is his golden  milestone,'” Fenneben quoted. “I've watched the smoke from many  chimneys up and down the Walnut Valley during my years here, and later  I've hunted out the people of each hearthstone and made friends with  them. So when I look away from my work here I see friendly tokens of  those I know out there.” He waved his hand toward the whole valley.  “And maybe, when they look up here and see the dome by day, or catch  our beacon light by night, they think of 'Funnybone,' too. It is well to  live close to the folks of your valley always.”    “You are a wonderful man, Doctor,” Burgess said.    “There are two 'milestones' I've never reached,” the Doctor went on.  “One is that place by the bend in the river. See the pigeons rising  above it now. I wonder if that strange white-haired woman ever came back  again. Elinor said she left Lagonda Ledge last summer.”    “Where's the other place?” Burgess would change the subject.    “It i's a little shaft of blue smoke from a wood fire rising above  those rocky places across the river. I've seen it so often, at irregular  times, that I've grown interested in it, but I have missed it since I  came back. It's like losing a friend. Every man has his vagaries. One of  mine is this friendship with the symbols of human homes.”    Burgess offered no comment in response. He could not see that the time  had come to tell Fenneben what Bond Saxon had confided to him about the  man below the smoke. So he left the hilltop and went down to the Saxon  House. He wanted to see Dennie, but found her father instead.    “That woman's left Pigeon Place again,” Saxon said. “Went early this  morning. It's freedom for me when I don't have to think of them two.  Thinking of myself is slavery enough.”    Burgess loitered aimlessly about the doorway for a while. It was a mild  afternoon, with no hint of winter, nor Christmas glitter of ice and snow  about it. Just a glorious finishing of an idyllic Kansas autumn rounding  out in the beauty of a sunshiny mid-December day. But to the man who  stood there, waiting for nothing at all, the day was a mockery. Behind  the fine scholarly face a storm was raging and there was only one friend  whom he could trust--Dennie.    “Let's go walking, you and me!”    Bug Buler put up one hand to Burgess, while he clutched a little red  ball in the other. Bug had an irresistible child voice and child touch,  and Burgess yielded to their leading. He had not realized until now  how lonely he was, and Bug was companionable by intuition and a stanch  little stroller.    North of town the river lay glistening between its vine-draped banks.  The two paused at the bend where Fenneben had been hurled almost to his  doom, and Burgess remembered the darkness, and the rain, and the limp  body he had held. He thought Fenneben was dead then, and even in that  moment he had felt a sense of disloyalty to Dennie as he realized that  he must think of Elinor entirely now. But why not? He had come to Kansas  for this very thinking. It must be his life purpose now.    Today Burgess began to wonder why Elinor must have a life of ease  provided for her and Dennie Saxon ask for nothing. Why should Joshua  Wream's conscience be his burden, too? Then he hated himself a little  more than ever, and duty and manly honor began their wrestle within him  again.    “Let's we go see the pigeons,” Bug suggested, tossing his ball in his  hands.    Burgess remembered what Bond had said of the woman's leaving. There  could be no harm in going inside, he thought. The leafless trees  and shrubbery revealed the neat little home that the summer foliage  concealed. Bug ran forward with childish curiosity and tiptoed up to a  low window, dropping his little red ball in his eagerness.    “Oh, tum! tum!” he cried. “Such a pretty picture frame and vase on the  table.”    He was nearly five years old now, but in his excitement he still used  baby language, as he pulled eagerly at Vincent Burgess' coat.    “It isn't nice to peep, Bug,” Burgess insisted, but he shaded his eyes  and glanced in to please the boy. He did not note the pretty gilt frame  nor the vase beside it on the table. But the face looking out of that  frame made him turn almost as cold and limp as Fenneben had been when  he was dragged from the river. Catching the little one by the hand he  hurried away.    At the gateway he lifted Bug in his arms.    He was not yet at ease with children.    “I dropped my ball,” Bug said. “Let me det it.”    “Oh, no; I'll get you another one. Don't go back,” Burgess urged. “Do  you know it is very rude to look into windows. Let's never tell anybody  we did it; nor ever, ever do it again. Will you remember?”    “Umph humph! I mean, yes, sir! I won't fornever do it again, nor tell  nobody.” Bug buttoned up his lips for a sphinx-like secrecy. “Nobody but  Dennie. And I may fordet it for her.”    “Yes, forget it, and we'll go away up the river and see other things.  Bug, what do you say when you want to keep from doing wrong?”    Bug looked up confidingly.    “I ist say, 'Dod, be merciless to me, a sinner'.”    “Why not merciful, Bug?”    “Tause! If He's merciful it's too easy and I'm no dooder,” Bug said,  wisely.    “Who told you the difference?” Burgess asked.    “Vic. He knows a lot. I wish I had my ball, but let's go up the river.”    “Out of the mouths of babes,” Burgess murmured and hugged the little one  close to him.      Victor Burleigh was in the little balcony of the dome late that  afternoon fixing a defective wiring. Through the open windows he could  see the skyline in every direction. The far-reaching gray prairie,  overhung by its dome of amethyst bordered round with opal and rimmed  with jasper, seemed in every blending tint and tone to call him back to  Norrie. The west bluff above the old Kickapoo Corral in the autumn, the  glen full of shadow-flecked light under the tender young April  leaves, the December landscape as it lay beyond Dr. Fenneben's study  windows--these belonged to Elinor. And all of them were blended in this  vision of inexpressible grandeur, unfolded to him now from the dome's  high vantage place.    “Twice Norrie has let me hold her in my arms and kiss her,” he mused.  “When I do that the third time it must be when there will be no remorse  to hound me afterward.” He looked down the winding Walnut toward the  whirlpool. “I'd rather swim that water than flounder here.”    The sound of footsteps on the rotunda stairs made him turn to see  Vincent Burgess just reaching the little balcony of the dome.    “I've come to have a word with you up here,” he said. “We met once  before in this rotunda.”    “Yes, down there in the arena,” Vic replied, recalling how like a beast  he had felt then. “I was a young hyena that day. Bug Buler came just  in time to save both of us. There is a comfort in feeling we can learn  something. I've needed books and college professors to temper me to  courtesy.”    It was the only apology Vic had ever offered to Burgess, who accepted it  as all that he deserved.    “We learn more from men than from books sometimes. I've learned from  them how courageous a man may be when the need for sacrifice comes. Sit  down, Burleigh, and let me tell you something.”    They sat down on the low seat beside the dome windows. Overhead gleamed  the message of high courage, _Ad Astra Per Aspera_. Below was the  artistic beauty of the rotunda, where the evening shadows were  deepening.    “We are higher than we were that other day. We care less for fighting as  we get farther up, maybe,” Burgess said, pleasantly.    “The only place to fight a man is in a cave, anyhow,” Burleigh replied,  looking at his brawny arms, nor dreaming how prophetic his words might  be.    “We don't belong to that class of men now, whatever our far off  ancestors may have been, but we are the sons of our fathers, Burleigh,  and it is left to the living to right the wrongs the dead have begun.”    Then, briefly, Vincent Burgess, A.B., Greek Professor from Harvard, told  to Vic Burleigh from a prairie claim out beyond the Walnut, a part of  what he had already told to Dennie Saxon, of the funds withheld from him  so long. Told it in general terms, however, not shielding his father  at all, but giving no hint that the first Victor Burleigh was his own  brother-in-law. And of the compact with Joshua Wream and of Norrie he  told nothing.    “Three days ago I did not know that you could be heir to this property,”   he concluded. “I've been interested in books and have left legal matters  to those who controlled them for me.”    He rose hastily, for Burleigh, saying nothing, was looking at him with  wide-open brown eyes that seemed to look straight into his soul.    “I can restore your property to you. I cannot change the past. You have  all the future in which to use it better than my father did, or I might  have done. Goodnight.”    He turned away and passed slowly down the rotunda stairs.    When he was gone Victor Burleigh turned to the open window of the  dome. He was not to blame that the beautiful earth under a magnificent  December sunset sky seemed all his own now.    “'If big, handsome Victor Burleigh had his corners knocked off and was  sandpapered down,'” he mused. “Well, what corners I haven't knocked off  myself have been knocked off for me and I've been sandpapered--Lord,  I've been sandpapered down all right. I'm at home on a carpet now. 'And  if he had money'.” Vic's face was triumphant. “It has come at last--the  money. And what of Elinor?”    The sacred memories of brief fleeting moments with her told him “what of  Elinor.”    “The barriers are down now. It is a glorious old world. I must hunt up  Trench and then--”    He closed the dome window, looked a moment at the brave Kansas motto,  radiant in the sunset light, and then, picking up his tools, he went  downstairs.    “Hello, Trench I he called as he reached the rotunda floor. I must see  you a minute.”    “Hello, you Angel-face! Case of necessity. Well, look a minute,” Trench  drawled. “But that's the limit, and twice as long as I'd care to see  you, although, I was hunting you. Funnybone wants to see you in there.”    Victor's eyes were glowing with a golden light as he entered Fenneben's  study, and the Dean noted the wonderful change from the big, awkward  fellow with a bulldog countenance to this self-poised gentleman whose  fine face it was a joy to see.    “I have a message for you, Burleigh. No hurry about it I was told, but  I am called away on important business and I must get it out of my mind.  An odd-looking fellow called at my door on the night I came home and  left a package for you. He said he had tried to find you and failed,  that he was a stranger here, and that you would understand the message  inside. He insisted on not giving this in any hurry, and as my coming  home has brought me a mass of things to consider, I have not been prompt  about it.”    Fenneben put a small package into Burleigh's hands.    “Examine it here, if you care to. You can fasten the door when you  leave. Goodby!” and he was gone.    Victor sat down and opened the package. Inside was a quaint little  silver pitcher, much ornamented, with the initial B embossed on the  smooth side.    “The lost pitcher--stolen the day my mother died--and I was warned never  to try to find who stole it.” He turned to the light of the west window.    “It is the very thing I found in the cave that night. The man who took  it may have been over there.” He glanced out of the window and saw a  thin twist of blue smoke rising above the ledges across the river.    “Who can have had it all this time, and why return it now?” he  questioned. As he turned the pitcher in his hands a paper fell out.    “The message inside!” He spread out the paper and read “the message  inside.”    Well for him that Dr. Fenneben had left him alone. The shining face and  eyes aglow changed suddenly to a white, hard countenance as he read this  message inside. It ran:      “Victor Burleigh. First, don't ever try to follow me. The day you do  I'll send you where I sent your father. No Burleigh can stay near me and  live. Now be wise.    “Second. You saved the baby I left in the old dugout. Before God I never  meant to kill it then. The thought of it has cursed my soul night and  day till I found out you had saved him.    “Third. The girl you want to marry--go and marry. Do anything, good or  bad, to destroy Burgess.    “Fourth. The money Burgess had is yours, only because I'm giving it to  you. It belongs to Bug Buler. He couldn't talk plain when you saved him.  He's not Bug Buler; he's Bug Burleigh, son of Victor Burleigh, heir to  V. B.'s money in the law. I've got all the proofs. You see why you can  have that money. Nobody will ever know but me. Don't hunt for me and  I'll never tell. TOM GRESH.”    The paper fell from Victor Burleigh's hands. The world, that ten minutes  ago was a rose-hued sunset land, was a dreary midnight waste now. The  one barrier between himself and Elinor had fallen only to rise up again.    Then came Satan into the game. “Nobody knew this but Gresh! Who had  saved Bug's life? Who had cared for him and would always care for him?  Why should Bug, little, loving Bug, come now to spoil his hopes? If Bug  knew he would be first to give it all to his beloved Vic.”    And then came Satan's ten strike. “No need to settle things now. Wait  and think it over.” And Vic decided in a blind way to think it over.    In the rotunda he met Trench, old Trench, slow of step but a lightning  calculator.    “Where are you going?” he exclaimed, as he saw Vic's face.    “I'm going to the whirlpool before I'm through,” Vic said, hoarsely.    Trench caught him in a powerful grip and shoved him to the foot of the  rotunda stairs.    “No,-you re-not-going-to-the-whirlpool,”' he said, slowly. “You're  going up to the top of the dome right against that _Ad Astra per Aspera_  business up there, and open the west window and look out at the world  the Lord made to heal hurt souls by looking at. And you are going to  stay up there until you have fought the thing out with yourself, and  come down like Moses did with the ten Commandments cut deep on the  tables of your stony old heart. If you don't, you'll not need to go to  old Lagonda's pool. By the holy saints, I'll take you there myself and  plunge you in just to rid the world of such a fool. You hear me! Now, go  on! And remember in your tussle that that big S cut over the old Sunrise  door out there stands for Service. That's what will make your name fit  you yet, Victor.”    Vic slowly climbed up to where an hour ago the sudden opportunity for  the fruition of his young life and hope had been brought to him. Lost  now, unless--Nobody would ever know and Bug could lose nothing. He  opened the west window and looked out at the Walnut Valley, dim and  shadowy now, and the silver prairies beyond it and the gorgeous crimson  tinted sky wherefrom the sun had slipped. And then and there, with his  face to the light, he wrestled with the black Apollyon of his soul. And  every minute the temptation grew to keep the funds “in trust,” and to  keep on caring for the boy he had cared for since babyhood. He clinched  his white teeth and the tiger light was in his eyes again as the longing  for Elinor's love overcame him. He pictured her as only one sunset  ago she had looked up into his eyes, her face transfigured with love's  sweetness, and he wished he might keep that picture forever. But,  somehow, between that face and his own, came the picture of little Bug  alone in the wretched dugout, reaching up baby arms to him for life and  safety; on his baby face a pleading trustfulness.    Victor unbuttoned his cuff and slipped up his sleeve to the scar on his  arm.    “Anybody can see the scar I put there when I cut out the poison,” he  said to himself, at last. “Nobody will see the scar on my soul, but I'll  cut out the poison just the same. I did not save that baby boy from the  rattlesnakes only to let him be crushed by the serpent in me. Trench was  right, the S over the doorway down there stands for Service as well  as for Sacrifice and Strife. Dr. Fenneben says they all enter into the  winning of a Master's Degree. Shall I ever get mine earned, I wonder?”    He looked once more at the west, all a soft purple, gray-veiled with  misty shadows, save over the place where the sun went out one shaft of  deepest rose hue tipped with golden flame was cleaving its way toward  the darkening zenith. Then he closed the window and went downstairs and  out into the beautiful December twilight.    In all Kansas in that evening hour no man breathed deeper of the sweet,  pure air, nor walked with firmer stride, than the man who had gone out  under the carved symbol of the college doorway, Victor Burleigh of the  junior class at Sunrise.        SUPREMACY     Make thyself free of Manhood's guild,   Pull down thy barns and greater build,   Pluck from the sunset's fruit of gold,   Glean from the heavens and ocean old,   From fireside lone and trampling street   Let thy life garner daily wheat,   The epic of a man rehearse,   Be something better than thy verse,   And thou shalt hear the life-blood flow   From farthest stars to grass-blades low.                           --LOWELL        CHAPTER XIII. THE MAN BELOW THE SMOKE    _And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors_.    ELINOR WREAM was standing at the gate as Victor Burleigh came striding  up the street.    “Where are you going so fast, Victor?” she asked. “Everybody is in a  rush this evening. We had a telegram from the East this afternoon. Uncle  Joshua is very ill, and Uncle Lloyd had to get away on short notice. Old  Bond Saxon went by just now, but,” lowering her voice, “he was awfully  drunk and slipped along like a snake.”    “Have you seen Bug?” Victor asked. “Dennie says he left a little while  ago to find his ball he lost out north this afternoon. He wouldn't tell  where, because he had promised not to.”    “No, I have not seen him. But don't be uneasy about Bug. He never plays  near the river, nor the railroad tracks, and he always comes in at the  right time,” Elinor said, comfortingly.    “I know he always has before, but I want to find him, anyhow.” The  affectionate tone told Elinor what a loving guardianship was given to  the unknown orphan child.    “There was a man here to see Uncle Lloyd just after he left this  evening. The same man that brought a little package for you the night we  came home. I suppose he comes from your part of the state out West, for  he seemed to know you and Bug. He asked me if Bug ever played along the  river and if he was a shy child. He was a strange-looking man, and  I thought he had the cruelest face I ever saw, but I am no expert on  strange faces.”    Victor did not wait for another word.    “I must find Bug right away. You can't think what he is to me, Elinor,”   and he hurried away.    At the bend in the Walnut Vic saw Bug's little scarlet stocking cap  beside the flat stone. The twilight was almost gone, but the glistening  river reflected on the torn bushes above the bank-full stream.    The crushing agony of the first minutes made them seem like hours. And  then the college discipline put in its work. Vic stopped and reasoned.    “Bug isn't down there. He never goes near the river. That strange man is  Tom Gresh. He killed my father and he's laid a trap for me. He doesn't  want to kill Bug. He wants to keep him to workout vengeance and hate on  me. He says he'll send me to my father if I go near him. Well, I'm going  so near he'll not doubt who I am, and I'll have Bug unharmed if I have  to send Gresh where my father could not go even with water to cool his  tongue. A man may fight with a man as he would fight with a beast to  save himself or something dearer than himself from beastly destruction,  Fenneben says. That's the battle before me now, and it's to the death.”    The tiger light was in the yellow eyes as never before and the stern jaw  was set, as Victor Burleigh hurried away. And this was the man who, such  a little while ago, was debating with himself over the quiet possession  of Bug Buler's inheritance. Truly the Mastery comes very near to such as  he.    It was with tiger-like step and instinct, too, that the young man went  leaping up the dark, frost-coated glen. About the mouth of the cave the  blackness was appalling. It seemed a place apart, cursed with the frown  of Nature. Yet in the April time, the sweetest moments of Vic's young  life had been spent in this very spot that now showed all the difference  between Love and Hate.    As he neared the opening of the cavern he guarded his footsteps more  carefully. The jungle beast was alert within him and the college  training was giving way to the might of muscle backed by a will to win.    A dim light gleamed in the cave and he watched outside now, as Gresh on  the April day had watched him inside. Down by a wood fire, whose smoke  was twisting out through a crevice overhead somewhere, little Bug was  sitting on Tom Gresh's big coat, the fire lighting up his tangle of  red-brown curls. His big brown eyes looking up at the man crouching by  the fire were eyes of innocent courage, and the expression on the sweet  child-face was impenetrable.    “He's a Burleigh. He's not afraid,” Vic thought, exultingly. “That's  half my battle. I had it out with the rattlesnakes. I'll do better  here.”    At that moment the outlaw turned toward the door and leaped to his feet  as Vic sprang inside.    Bug started up with outstretched arms.    “Keep out of the way, Bug,” Vic cried, as the two men clinched.    And the struggle began. They were evenly matched, and both had the  sinews of giants. The outlaw had the advantage of an iron strength,  hardened by years of out-door life. But the college that had softened  the country boy somewhat gave in return the quick judgment and superior  agility of the trained power that counts against weight before the  battle is over. But withal, it was terrible. One fighter was a murderer  by trade, his hand steady for the blackest deeds, and here was a man he  had waited long months to destroy. The other fighter was in the struggle  to save a life dear to him, a life that must vindicate his conscience  and preserve his soul's peace.    Across the stone-floored cave they threshed in fury, until at the  farther wall Gresh flung Vic from him against the jagged rock with a  force that cut a gash across the boy's head. The blood splashed on both  men's faces as they renewed the strife. Then with a quick twist Burleigh  threw the outlaw to the floor and held him in a clutch that weighed him  down like a ledge of rock; and it was pound for pound again.    Away from the mass of burning coals the blackness was horrible. Beyond  that fire Bug sat, silent as the stone wall behind him. Gresh gained the  mastery again, and with a grip on Vic's throat was about to thrust his  head, face downward, into the burning embers. Vic understood and strove  for his own life with a maniac's might, for he knew that one more wrench  would end the thing.    “You first, and then the baby; I'll roast you both,” Gresh hissed, and  Vic smelled the heat of the wood flame.    But who had counted on Bug? He had watched this fearful grapple,  motionless and terror-stricken, and now with a child's vision he saw  what Gresh meant to do. Springing up, he caught the heavy coat on which  he had been sitting and flung it on the fire, smothering the embers and  putting the cavern into complete darkness.    Vic gained the vantage by this unlooked for movement and the grip  shifted. The fighters fell to the floor and then began the same kind of  struggle by which Burleigh had out-generaled big, unconquerable Trench  one day. The two had rolled and fought in college combat from the top  of the limestone ridge to the lower campus and landed with Burleigh  gripping Trench helpless to defend further. That battle was friend with  friend. This battle was to the death. The blood of both men smeared the  floor as they tore at each other like wild beasts, and no man could have  told which oftenest had the vantage hold, nor how the strife would end.  But it did end soon. The heavy coat, that had smothered the fire and  saved Vic, smoldered a little, then flared into flame, lighting  the whole cave, and throwing out black and awful shadows of the two  fighters. They were close to the hole in the inner wall now. Gresh's  face in that unsteady glare was horrible to see. He loosed his hold a  second, then lunged at Vic with the fury of a mad brute. And Vic, who  had fought the devil in himself to a standstill three hours ago, now  caught the fiend outside of him for a finishing blow, and the strength  of that last struggle was terrific.    Up to this time Vic had not spoken.    “I killed the other snakes. I'll kill you now,” he growled, as he held  the outlaw at length in a conquering grip, his knees on Gresh's breast,  his right hand on Gresh's throat.    In that weird light the conqueror's face was only a degree less brutal  than the outlaw's face. And Burleigh meant every word, for murder was  in his heart and in his clutching fingers. Beneath the weight of his  strength Gresh slowly relaxed, struggling fiercely at first and groping  blindly to escape. Then he began to whine for mercy, but his whining  maddened his conqueror more than his blows had done. For such strife is  no mere wrestling match. Every blow struck against a fellowman is as  the smell of blood to the tiger, feeding a fiendish eagerness to kill.  Beside, Burleigh had ample cause for vengeance. The creature under his  grip was not only a bootlegger through whose evil influence men took  other lives or lost their own; he had slain one innocent man, Vic's own  father, and in the room where his dead mother lay had robbed Vic's home  of every valuable thing. He had sworn vengeance on all who bore the  name of Burleigh. What fate might await Bug, Vic dared not picture. One  strangling grip now could finish the business forever, and his clutch  tightened, as Gresh lay begging like a coward for his own worthless  life.    “It's a good thing a fellow has a guardian angel once in a while. We  get pretty close to the edge sometimes and never know how near we are to  destruction,” Vic had said to Elinor in here on the April day.    It was not Vic's guardian angel, but little Bug whose white face was  thrust between him and his victim, and the touch of a soft little hand  and the pleading child-voice that cried:    “Don't kill him, Vic. He's frough of fighting now. Don't hurt him no  more.”    Vic staid his hand at the words. The few minutes of this mad-beast duel  had made him forget the sound of human voices. He half lifted himself  from Gresh's body at Bug's cry. And Bug, wise beyond his years,  quaint-minded little Bug, said, softly:    “Fordive us our debts as we fordive our debtors.”    Strange, loving words of the Man of Galilee, spoken on the mountain-side  long, long ago, and echoed now by childish lips in the dying light of  the cavern to these two men, drunk with brute-lust for human blood! For  Vic the words struck like blows. All the years since his father's death  he had waited for this hour. At last he had met and vanquished the man  who had taken his father's life, and now, exultant in his victory, came  this little child's voice.    The cave darkened. A mist, half blood, half blindness, came before his  eyes, but clear to his ears there sounded the ringing words:    “Vengeance is mine; I will repay!”    It was the voice of Discipline calling to his better judgment, as Bug's  innocent pleading spoke to the finer man within him.    Under his grip Gresh lay motionless, all power of resistance threshed  out of him.    “Are you ready to quit?” Vic questioned, hoarsely, bending over the  almost lifeless form.    The outlaw mumbled assent.    “Then I'll let you live, you miserable wretch, and the courts will take  care of you.”    Burleigh himself was faint from strife and loss of blood. As he relaxed  his vigilance the last atom of strength, the last hope of escape  returned to Gresh. He sprang to his feet, staggered blindly then, quick  as a panther, he leaped through the hole in the farther wall, wriggled  swiftly into the blind crevices of the inner cave, and was gone.    It was Trench who dressed Vic's head that night and shielded him until  his strength returned. But it was Bond Saxon who counseled patience.    “Don't squeal to the sheriff now,” he urged. “The scoundrel is gone, and  it would make a nine days' hooray, and nothing would come of it. He was  darned slick to take the time when Funnybone was away.”    “Why?” Vic asked.    But Bond would not tell why. And Vic never dreamed how much cause Bond  Saxon had to dread the day when Tom Gresh should be brought into court,  and his own great crime committed in his drunken hours would demand  retribution. So Lagonda Ledge and Sunrise knew nothing of what had  occurred. Burleigh had no recourse but to wait, while Bug buttoned  up his lips, as he had done for Burgess out at Pigeon Place, and  conveniently “fordot” what he chose not to tell. But he wandered no more  alone about the pretty by-corners of Lagonda Ledge.        CHAPTER XIV. THE DERELICTS     _I dimly guess from blessings known       Of greater out of sight,   And, with the chastened Psalmist, own       His judgments, too, are right.     I know not what the future hath       Of marvel or surprise,   Assured alone that life and death       His mercy underlies_.                      --WHITTIER    IT was early spring before Dr. Fenneben returned to Lagonda Ledge.  Everybody thought the new line on his face was put there by the death  of his brother. To those who loved him most--that is, to all Lagonda  Ledge--he was growing handsomer every year, and even with this new  expression his countenance wore a more kindly grace than ever before.    “Norrie, your uncle was a strange man,” Fenneben declared, as he and  Elinor sat in the library on the evening of his return. “Naturally, I am  unlike my stepbrothers, but I have not even understood them. There  were many things I learned at Joshua's bedside that I never knew of the  family before. There were some things for you to know, but not now.”    “I can trust you, Uncle Lloyd, to do just the right thing,” Norrie  declared.    The new line of sadness deepened in Lloyd Fenneben's face.    “That is a hard thing to do sometimes. Your trust will help me  wonderfully, however,” he replied. “My brother in his last hours made  urgent requests of me and pled with me until I pledged my word to carry  out his wishes. Here's where I need your trust most.”    Elinor bent over her uncle and softly stroked the heavy black hair from  his forehead.    “Here's where I help you most, then,” she said, gently.    “I have some funds, Elinor, to be yours at your graduation--not before.  Believe me, dear girl, I begged of Joshua to let me turn them over",62.01,9.3,11.1,8.01,12.7,5.99,1287,14.75,13.09,8th and 9th grade
